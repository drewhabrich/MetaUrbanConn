AB  - In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity.

AB  - Urban expansion threatens global biodiversity through the destruction of natural and semi-natural habitats and increased levels of disturbance. Whilst woodlands in urban areas may reduce the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity, they are often subject to under or over-management and consist of small, fragmented patches which may be isolated. Effective management strategies for urban woodland require an understanding of the ecology and habitat requirements of all relevant taxa. Yet, little is known of how invertebrate, and in particular moth, assemblages utilise urban woodland despite being commonly found within the urban landscape. Here we show that the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages found within urban woodlands are determined by woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and the surrounding landscape. In general, mature broadleaved woodlands supported the highest abundance and diversity of moths. Large compact woodlands with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix were associated with higher moth abundance than small complex woodlands. Woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscape, suggesting that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be relatively more important for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. Our results show that the planting of broadleaved woodlands, retaining mature trees and minimising woodland fragmentation will be beneficial for moth assemblages.

AB  - To ensure viable species populations in fragmented landscapes, individuals must be able to move between suitable habitat patches. Despite the increased interest in biodiversity assessment in urban environments, the ecological relevance of habitat connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes remains largely unknown. The first step to understanding the role of habitat connectivity in urban ecology is the challenging task of assessing connectivity in the complex patchwork of contrasting habitats that is found in cities.
   We developed a data-based framework, minimizing the use of subjective assumptions, to assess habitat connectivity that consists of the following sequential steps: (1) identification of habitat preference based on empirical habitat-use data; (2) derivation of habitat resistance surfaces evaluating various transformation functions; (3) modeling of different connectivity maps with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape), a method considering all possible pathways across the landscape simultaneously; and (4) identification of the best connectivity map with information-theoretic model selection. We applied this analytical framework to assess habitat connectivity for the European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, a model species for ground-dwelling animals, in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, using GPS track points from 40 individuals.
   The best model revealed spatially explicit connectivity "pinch points," as well as multiple habitat connections. Cross-validation indicated the general validity of the selected connectivity model. The results show that both habitat connectivity and habitat quality affect the movement of urban hedgehogs (relative importance of the two variables was 19.2% and 80.8%, respectively), and are thus both relevant for predicting urban animal movements.
   Our study demonstrates that even in the complex habitat patchwork of cities, habitat connectivity plays a major role for ground-dwelling animal moverrient. Data-based habitat connectivity maps can thus serve as an important tool for city planners to identify habitat corridors and plan appropriate management and conservation measures for urban animals. The analytical framework we describe to model such connectivity maps is generally applicable to different types of habitat-use data and can be adapted to the movement scale of the focal species. It also allows evaluation of the impact of future landscape changes or management scenarios on habitat connectivity in urban landscapes.

AB  - Human disturbances contribute significantly to the decrease in the quantity and connectivity of the natural habitats. Taking Lincang City in Lancang River Valley as a case study, we focused on the forest fragmentation and habitat connectivity loss associated with its road network and expansion in the past 15 years. Our findings show that, from 1991 to 2006, its forest habitat (>25 ha) decreased to 18.3% of the total area due to fragmentation. Landscape fragmentation indices (NP, PLAND, and LPI) changed more than the landscape shapes and the aggregation indices (SHAPE, FRAC, and DIVISION). Habitat loss occurred more often in the lower elevations and in areas near the city and road network. Landscape connectivity loss was 91.3%, which showed a more significant decrease than did the landscape pattern changes. With sensitivity analysis of different animals' dispersal abilities and landscape resistance consideration, our study reveals that landscape connectivity could be more effective in showing the potential ecological effects caused by city and road network extension.

AB  - Conservation research has historically been aimed at preserving high value natural habitats, but urbanization and its associated impacts have prompted broader mandates that include the preservation and promotion of biodiversity in cities. Current efforts within urban landscapes aim to support biodiversity and diverse ecosystem services such as storm water management, sustainable food production, and toxin remediation. Arthropod natural enemies provide biocontrol services important for the ecosystem management of urban greenspaces. Establishing habitat for these and other beneficial arthropods is a growing area of urban conservation. Habitat design, resource inputs, management, and abiotic conditions shape the value of greenspace habitats for arthropods. In general, larger patches with diverse plant communities support a greater abundance and diversity of natural enemies and biocontrol services, yet opposing patterns or no effects have also been documented. The surrounding landscape is likely a contributor to this variation in natural enemy response to patch-scale habitat design and management. Looking across rural-urban landscape gradients, natural enemy communities shift toward dominance by habitat generalists and disturbance tolerant species in urban areas compared to rural or natural communities. These changes have been linked to variation in habitat fragmentation, plant productivity and management intensity. In landscape-scale studies focusing solely within cities, variables such as impervious surface area and greenspace connectivity affect the community assembly of natural enemies within a patch. Given these findings, a greater mechanistic understanding of how both the composition and spatial context of urban greenspaces influence natural enemy biodiversity-biocontrol relationships is needed to advance conservation planning and implementation.

AB  - Urbanisation leads to natural habitats being fragmented with various effects according to the species and their ecological characteristics. Paradoxically, the urbanisation process creates relatively unused environments, wastelands, habitats which could contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. In this review we examined the role of wastelands in maintaining biodiversity in the city and assessed the different factors responsible for wasteland biodiversity. 37 articles were suitable for our aim. Most of the studies have been conducted in large cities in Western and Central Europe. A wasteland is defined as an abandoned site with spontaneous vegetation (i.e. wild grown vegetation). In most cases, wastelands harbour more species than other urban green spaces. The processes which affect the bio diversity of wastelands operate on two different levels. Locally, the area size, age, soil, microclimate and the vegetation structure are the dominant factors. As in other environments, the species richness increases with the size of the wasteland. Wastelands of different ages include different stages of vegetation, ranging from pioneer to pre-forest stages, and consequently harbour different communities of plants and animals. The diversity of anthropogenic soil substrates leads to different plant communities. At the landscape scale, matrix composition and geographic connectivity between wastelands influence the biodiversity of wastelands, although to a lesser extent than the local features. We show that wastelands have a real potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. At the city scale, they represent habitats which urban planners need to take into account and include in dynamic urban planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although urban sprawl is increasingly becoming a worldwide problem, the effects associated with urbanization on local biodiversity particularly in the developing countries, is still poorly understood. We investigated plant species richness along urban-rural gradients in an Afro-tropical metropolitan Morogoro city in Tanzania, and examined patterns of species movement by humans within and outside the city and its potential impact on habitat homogenization of urban ecosystems. Biodiversity information was assessed in 120 sample plots (25 x 25 m) distributed in core urban, sub-urban and peri-urban (rural) zones, while patterns of plant resource use and species movement were surveyed from 120 households in the study area. We found the highest tree species richness in the urban core (82.6 +/- A 1.4 species) whereas tree density decreased from peri-urban (465.60 +/- A 152.03 tree/ha) to urban core (244.00 +/- A 120.86 tree/ha) and species diversity decreased from urban core (alpha A = 2.82 +/- A 0.01) to peri-urban area (alpha A = 2.61 +/- A 0.23). Further, the proportion of exotic species was significantly higher (75.6 %) than that of native species in the study area (p = 0.001). Tree community assemblages showed least differences among the study zones (dissimilarity = 10 %) and appear to have been influenced by local cultural differences, species movement as well as local resource use. Furthermore, species movement exhibited a random and multi-directional pattern perpetuated by human and nonhuman factors. Movements were significantly higher between backyard gardens within the city than from outside. Alien species by far outnumbered native plant species moving across urban landscapes, potentially increasing species homogenization. Conservation awareness is needed to avoid habitat homogenization due to problems associated with urban sprawl and to maintain heterogeneous habitats for the urban wildlife.

AB  - For several decades, the sprawling of urbanisation has resulted in the loss of natural habitats and in landscape fragmentation and thus represents one of the main causes of the erosion of biodiversity. Green spaces in urban areas help maintain ecological connectivity and provide ecosystem services to citizens. The impact of urban green spaces on the conservation of biodiversity and their contribution to ecological networks in urban areas have been studied. However, little is known about the area occupied by green spaces at business sites (GSBS) or about their organisation within the urban matrix and their possible contribution to the maintenance of functional connectivity at local and regional scales.
   This study analysed the evolution in the dynamics and locations of business sites over the past 30 years in the Ile-de-France region. Cartographic data allowed us to identify GSBS which spanned 8700 ha and represented 8% of the urban green spaces forming the herbaceous network. Using a graph theoretic modelling approach, we quantified the potential contribution of GSBS to regional connectivity. We demonstrated that GSBS did not add to connectivity in terms of total area but rather through the density of the links that these sites shared with other green spaces or via their strategic position in the network, i.e., their capacity to serve as stepping stones. The contribution of GSBS was greatest in suburban and pericentral sectors, where most business activities have been developed in the past 30 years and land resources remain available for green space development.

AB  - Throughout the long history of landscape ecology, scientists have devoted substantial efforts to understand potential forest patch size and isolation effects on the abundance and diversity of woodland species. Which bird species flourish or perish as a response to forest fragmentation may compose fundamental information for the reserve design and landscape management in a region. Here, we designed a bird survey of the urban forest areas in Dangjin city located on South Korea's west coast to test (1) if bird species richness follows the pattern predicted by species-area relationship and (2) if there is seasonal variation in the pattern. As expected, patch area was the most significant variable explaining patch occupancy of resident and summering woodland birds in every season. Our data about the number of dominant vegetation suggest that larger areas contain greater habitat heterogeneity and more diverse niches. About half of the resident species did not appear to be area-sensitive and were categorized as edge species. On the other hand, many summering species showed strong area-sensitivity, potentially avoiding small patches that are almost entirely edge habitats in urban landscape. Our results suggest that lots of contemporary forest edges, fragmented by agricultural or urban development, do not any more function for feeding or nesting places for those species.

AB  - Deforestation around large urban centers usually creates a fragmented landscape with reduced natural areas. Biodiversity studies in these forest remnants provide useful tools for designing conservation strategies that maximize the persistence of local diversity and promote their connectivity. Inventories focused on particular taxa have been proposed as a useful mechanism that allows a better knowledge of the state of biodiversity in a given area, the butterflies are one of the taxonomic groups more frequently used for these studies. In this paper, we study the diversity and composition of the butterfly community in the cloud forest of the reserve El Romeral located southwest of the Medellin City in the Aburra Valley, Colombia. We recorded 75 species belonging to 5 butterfly families, more than recorded for similar forests associated with periurban areas. El Romeral shares only 50% of the species with the main periurban forest located east of the valley, indicating that each of the surrounding forest remnants of the city may have a unique composition of species being complementary and useful for regional conservation.

AB  - The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.

AB  - Butterflies (Lepidoptera) have attracted more attention as bin-indicators of terrestrial ecosystems than other terrestrial arthropods. This study determined butterfly species turnover at a priori selected habitat patches inside Nduli Nature Reserve and its surrounding landscape, and their response to measured environmental variables. Using the line transect method, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22 species were sampled from all 16 sampling units (Sus), of which 13 species occurred in two or more Sus across the study site. Habitat patches outside the reserve were higher in butterfly species richness and abundance than inside the reserve. Papilio demodocus Esper, Borbo gemella Mabille, Precis octavia (Cramer) and Hypolimnas missipus (Linnaeus) were each restricted to one sampling unit. Hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and correspondence analyses grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled. Canonical correspondence analysis results indicated that certain site (environmental) variables, e.g. percentage herb cover, grazing intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density accounted for species distribution patterns across Sus. The implications of the study suggest that habitat patch level management for conservation action should aim at preserving sufficient herb cover and nectaring plants, especially during the summer season to cater for all developmental stages of butterfly species in the study area. Furthermore, species richness within the reserve can be encouraged by using vegetation linkages and corridors between the reserve and its surrounding landscape. Butterflies identified during the study can serve as indicator species for assessing the conservation value of habitat patches in the study area and for increasing public awareness of the need to conserve butterflies and the invertebrate fauna of the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality between the months of November and April.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess which variables influence the distribution of birds in urban parks. Twenty parks were studied in a city on the Spanish high plateau during the breeding season, and relationships among park characteristics, bird richness, and individual bird presences were established. The park area and tree cover accounted for 73.1% of the variation in bird richness. Although area size was the best predictor of species richness (65% of the variation), some species did not seem to be related to this variable but rather to others, such as vegetation and the degree of park isolation with respect to other areas. Contrary to what is normally expected, the distance from our parks to the river did not influence their bird species richness.

AB  - The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe urban sprawl, agricultural intensification and rural abandonment are observed in a Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes.

AB  - Although ecological connectivity conservation in urban areas has recently been recognized as an important issue, less is known about its relationship to urban form and landscape pattern. This study investigates how urban morphology influences regional ecosystem pattern and landscape connectivity. Two metropolitan landscapes, Phoenix, AZ, USA, and Izmir, Turkey, were compared, both of which are fast-growing regions in their national context. A wide range of variables were considered for identifying natural and urban properties. The natural characteristics include typology of urban ecosystems, urban to natural cover ratio, dominant habitat type, urban biodiversity, landscape context, and connectivity conservation efforts. Urban parameters examine urban form, urban extent, urban cover proportion, growth rate, populations, urban gradient, major drivers of urbanization, urban density, and mode/approach of urban development. Twelve landscape metrics were measured and compared across the natural patches. Results show that there is little difference in landscape connectivity in the rural zones of Phoenix and Izmir, although Phoenix has slightly higher connectivity values. The connectivity variance in urbanized areas, however, is significantly dependent on the region. For example, Phoenix urban zones have substantially lower connectivity than either urban or suburban zones in Izmir. Findings demonstrate that small and compact urban settlements with more dense populations are more likely to conserve landscape connectivity compared to multiple-concentric but amalgamated urban form spreading all over the landscape (aka urban sprawl).

AB  - Urban densification is often considered has a green planning policy. However, its effects on woodland arthropods have been rarely analysed. To fill this gap, a multi-taxa approach using three ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages was conducted on 11 woodlands located along an urbanisation gradient. The gradient range from rural areas to one of the most urbanized cities in the world: Paris (France). Spiders, ground beetles and rove beetles were sampled with pitfall traps. We addressed the two following questions: (i) do the responses to urbanisation differ between taxa and/or between trait groups (habitat affinity to woodlands and dispersal capability) along the gradient? (ii) do the richness and abundance show a linear or an intermediate response? Our results showed a replacement of forest and non-flying species by generalist species and flying species with an increasing level of urbanisation. In term of species richness and abundance, the response varied between taxonomical and also trait groups. Some groups showed a strong linear decrease like forest carabids but other groups like spiders showed maximum values at intermediate levels of urbanisation. However, after a threshold of 70 % of built-in area, urbanisation negatively affected the species richness of all taxa and almost all trait groups, with a stronger effect on forest species. We suggest that the urban densification strongly impacted the assemblages of ground-dwelling arthropods by modifying both landscape and local properties of woodlands. To be considered as a green planning policy, the deleterious effects of urban densification should be mitigated.

AB  - Remote sensing provides continuous, large-area coverage that supports synoptic, consistent, and repeatable monitoring of vegetation and, therefore, can be used to derive indirect indicators of biodiversity. We used a 21-year archive of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (1987-2007) data to assess changes in an indirect indicator of biodiversity, the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), which has proven useful in predicting patterns of species richness and abundance at broad spatial scales (>1 km(2)). The index has 3 components reflecting integrated vegetation greenness, vegetation seasonality, and minimum vegetated cover. We used a Theil-Sen nonparametric rank-based test and computed the proportion of cells with positive or negative DHI trends within both the Canadian protected area network and the Canadian ecoprovinces. In general, the smaller protected and natural areas close to urban development had relatively larger proportions of trending DHI components over the 21-year period, than the larger, more remote protected regions. Most protected areas and ecoprovinces observed an overall increase in integrated greenness and a reduction in vegetation seasonality over the analysis period. We conclude that the ability to derive trends from long time-series of remote sensing data helps focus local biodiversity monitoring programs by guiding actions to areas of the greatest observed change.

AB  - Geographical detector models provide a quantitative approach for evaluating spatial correlations among ecological factors, population density and landscape connectivity. Here, we used a geographical model to assess the influence of different gradients of urbanization, human activities and various environmental factors on the connectivity of urban forest landscapes in Xiamen, China from 1996 to 2006. Our overarching hypothesis is that human activity has modified certain ecological factors in a way that has affected the connectivity of urban forest landscapes. Therefore, spatiotemporal distributions of landscape connectivity should be similar to those of ecological factors and can be represented quantitatively. Integral indices of connectivity and population density were employed to represent urban forest landscape connectivity and human activity, respectively. We then simulated the spatial relationship between forest patches and population density with Conefor 2.6 software. A geographical detector model was used to identify the dominant factors that affect urban forest landscape connectivity. The results showed that a distance of 600 m was the threshold of node importance. Mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, elevation, patch area, population density and dominant species had significant effects on the node importance. Mean annual temperature was more significant than population density in controlling the spatial pattern of the delta of the integral index of connectivity (dIIC). The spatial interaction between population density and various ecological factors as well as their linearly enhanced or nonlinearity enhanced urban forest landscape connectivity. In conclusion, a combination of graph theory and geographical detector models is effective for quantitatively evaluating interactive relationships among ecological factors, population density and landscape connectivity.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are complex social-ecological systems with important functions. These man-made ecosystems have certain areas with high biological diversity, including both remnant species and species purposefully or unintentionally introduced by human actions. There can be important habitats and valuable corridors for both common and less common species within the urban sprawl. The main aim of this study is to respond to the call for integrative research by studying relationships between the anthropogenic activities and urban biodiversity of the cities from the southern part of Rajasthan, India. We observed that the local population was interested in biodiversity, especially phenological events, and benefited from it by getting aesthetic pleasure and information on seasonal changes. The cities, such as Udaipur have an artificially developed diversified habitat within urban limits which provides shelter and protection to a variety of flora and fauna species. Urban areas are often rich in species, particularly vascular plants and many groups of animals, especially birds. Further, urban green spaces in the form of artificial parks and agricultural fields have the diversity of flora, whereas artificial lakes are the sites of wetland species. The most eye-catching faunal group of birds was used to understand the importance of biodiversity for Udaipur. Bird diversity and abundance are indicators of the condition of watershed habitats, both terrestrial and wetland. The role of urban areas in functions, such as the provision of ecosystem services will largely be determined by patterns of biodiversity within that area. To keep these biological indicators healthy, watershed conditions should be managed to encourage bird survival and reproduction. Further, to support an integrative approach in urban green planning, both ecological and social research has to be incorporated in the planning process.

AB  - Urban green spaces, such as forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens, are increasingly highlighted as biodiversity refuges and are of growing interest to conservation. At the same time, the burgeoning urban garden movement partially seeks to ameliorate problems of food security. Arthropods link these two issues (conservation and food security) given their abundance, diversity, and role as providers of ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. Many previous studies of urban arthropods focused on a single taxon (e.g. order or family), and examined either local habitat drivers or effects of landscape characteristics. In contrast, we examined both local and landscape drivers of community patterns, and examined differences in abundance, richness, and trophic structure of arthropod communities in urban forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens. We sampled ground-foraging arthropods, collected data on 24 local habitat features (e.g., vegetation, ground cover, concrete), and examined land-cover types within 2 km of 12 study sites in Toledo, Ohio. We found that abundance and richness of urban arthropods differed by habitat type and that richness of ants and spiders, in particular, varied among lots, gardens, and forests. Several local and landscape factors correlated with changes in abundance, richness, and trophic composition of arthropods, and different factors were important for specific arthropod groups. Overwhelmingly, local factors were the predominant (80 % of interactions) driver of arthropods in this urban environment. These results indicate that park managers and gardeners alike may be able to manage forests and gardens to promote biodiversity of desired organisms and potentially improve ecosystem services within the urban landscape.

AB  - Urbanization can promote the replacement of native species by exotic species resulting in an increase in community's similarity overtime. This process is called biotic homogenization, which is usually studied at large scale from species lists. Our paper addresses the effects of urbanization on plant community at local scale in areas where urban policies are implemented. We focus on private gardens as they are the most common components of green spaces in European urbanized areas. They are also a place where exotic species are introduced. Observations were made on spontaneous flora sampled from gardens in two study sites of the French Mediterranean: a large city and a village located in an urbanizing rural area. We evaluated how urban landscape influences floristic similarity and how exotic species affect homogenization. We divided each study site in three built-up density zones. As the urbanization process of both sites did not take place at the same time, we were able to assess the effect of time on floristic similarity. Results indicate that floristic similarity is less important in high dense built-up areas than in low dense ones. Exotic species tend to reduce floristic similarity in city centers and increase floristic similarity in low dense built-up areas in both sites. Landscape metrics calculated in built-up areas surrounding the gardens influence floristic similarity. Lastly, we found that urban planning in terms of built-up density affects biodiversity distribution and that private gardens can provide landscape connectivity within urban areas.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is one of the major issues related to biodiversity conservation and to the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ES). Several models were developed to assess landscape connectivity but lack of data and mismatching scale of analysis often represent insurmountable constraints for the correct evaluation and integration of ecological connectivity into plans and assessment procedures. In this paper a procedure for ES assessment related with Habitat and Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) is proposed. The method is based on the connectivity measure furnished by the last version of PANDORA model and uses a modified formulation of current ES evaluation. The implementation of the model in a real case has highlighted its potential multi-scale workability. The spatial approach of the model aims at furnishing a further tool for the spread of ES and landscape ecology concepts into procedures of assessment (e.g. EIA, SEA) and land use planning at different administrative scales.

AB  - More than half of the planet's residents now live in urban areas. In the foreseeable future, global urbanization will continue. China is one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world, and during the past three decades its urban expansion has encroached on productive lands and caused myriad environmental problems. To achieve urban sustainability, Chinese cities need to be better designed, planned, and managed in a more ecological and sustainable way. In this study, we focused on Shenzhen City in southern China, which has experienced extremely rapid urbanization and socioeconomic transformations since China's economic reform and open-door policy enacted in 1978. We have proposed a methodology for environmental resource accounting, which consists of ecosystem services, atmospheric environment capacity, water environment resource, and land value. Our methodology recognizes the strategic significance for conserving biodiversity and maintaining high environmental quality. In particular, protecting the remaining natural and semi-natural areas in and around the city - ecological core areas - is of paramount importance. In addition to valuating urban environmental resources and services, we have also proposed an ecological network-based urban landscape design in order to improve urban sustainability for the city. Our proposed urban design plan has been taken seriously by the city government. Overall, this study provides a quantitative approach for research and practice in urban sustainability, and should be of value to other rapidly urbanizing regions around the world.

AB  - Interventions that can reduce the loss and the fragmentation of ecosystems are very important in the sphere of biodiversity conservation policies applied to areas of high human activity. Ecological networks, on a different scale, are important analytical and design tools, and they can highlight sources of biodiversity with the intention of ecological unification.
   The Tuscany Ecological Network project, based on habitat sustainability models and converted into a planning tool for the landscape plan of Tuscany, has underlined the need to pursue the objectives of biodiversity conservation within a landscape or extended area. The project approaches across the board sectoral policies in urban planning and infrastructure in the agricultural, forestry, and protected areas.

AB  - Rapid changes in agricultural landscape structure and composition affect many different farmland biotas, including carnivores, which are a key element of ecosystem stability, yet little is known about their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1-7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

AB  - Stellaria holostea is a clonal herb highly confined to well-established deciduous forests. This study examined whether its genetic diversity and spatial genetic organization in urban forest islands is similar to the values from well-established populations outside urban landscape. We studied four populations in Warsaw and two populations from well preserved forests outside the city. Genetic diversity was greater in populations from well-preserved forests than from forests heavily exploited in the past. High clonal diversity indices indicate that the studied populations did not lose the ability to reproduce sexually. The small populations in urban forests differed from the remaining sites in spatial organization. High overall F-ST (0.24) and the lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distance between the studied populations indicate limited gene flow. Urban forests may be of great value for conservation of S. holostea and other ancient forest species as they may still harbor substantial genetic variability despite their isolation.

AB  - Urban-rural landscape planning research is nowadays focusing on strategies and tools that support practitioners in designing integrated spaces starting from the analysis of local areas, where human and natural pressures interfere. A prominent framework is provided by the ecological networks, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas or patches (the nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (the edges). Ecological networks are useful for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create or strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we aim at designing an ecological network for the periurban area on the town of Nuoro in central Sardinia. The narrative unfolds in two parts. Part A is presented in this paper and includes its methodological premises, i.e. biodiversity conservation and ecological network analysis and design, and the introductory elements of a spatial analysis on a pilot ecological network of one hundred patches. We locate patches by focusing on the ecosystems supported by the target vegetal species holm oak (Quercus ilex) and cultivated or wild olive (Olea europaea var. sativa, O.europaea var. sylverstis). These are very common plants species in the municipality and some animal species are active as seed dispersal. The reminder, i.e. Part B, of the essay is presented in an homonymous paper that focuses on the illustration of the network analysis conceived as a monitoring system and, in future perspective, as a planning support system.

AB  - Land use activity is a major issue and challenge for town and country planners. Modelling and managing urban growth is a complex problem. Cities are now recognized as complex, non-linear and dynamic process systems. The design of a system that can handle these complexities is a challenging prospect. Local governments that implement urban growth models need to estimate the amount of urban land required in the future given anticipated growth of housing, business, recreation and other urban uses within the boundary. There are so many negative implications related with the type of inappropriate urban development such as increased traffic and demand for mobility, reduced landscape attractively, land use fragmentation, loss of biodiversity and alterations of the hydrological cycle. The aim of this study is to use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make a powerful tool for simulating urban growth patterns. Our study area is Sanandaj city located in the west of Iran. Landsat imageries acquired at 2000 and 2006 are used. Dataset were used include distance to principle roads, distance to residential areas, elevation, slope, distance to green spaces and distance to region centers. In this study an appropriate methodology for urban growth modelling using satellite remotely sensed data is presented and evaluated. Percent Correct Match (PCM) and Figure of Merit were used to evaluate ANN results.

AB  - Environmental disturbances such as deforestation, urbanization or pollution have been widely acknowledged to play a key role in the emergence of many infectious diseases, including mosquito-borne viruses. However, we have little understanding of how habitat isolation affects the communities containing disease vectors. Here, we test the effects of habitat type and isolation on the colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquitoes and their aquatic predators in water-filled containers in northwestern Thailand. For eight weeks water-filled containers were monitored in areas containing forest, urban and agricultural habitats and mixtures of these three. Mosquito larvae of the genera Aedes and Culex appeared to be differentially affected by the presence of the dominant predator; Toxorhynchites splendens (Culicidae). Therefore, a predation experiment was conducted to determine predator response to prey density and its relative effects on different mosquito prey populations. Colonization rates, species richness and abundances of mosquito predators were strongly related to forest habitat and to the distance from other aquatic habitats. Areas with more tree cover had higher predator species richness and abundance in containers. Containers that were close to surface water were more rapidly colonized than those further away. In all habitat types, including urban areas, when predators were present, the number of mosquito larvae was much tower. Containers in urban areas closer to water-bodies, or with more canopy cover, had higher predator colonization rates and species richness. T spiendens (Culicidae) preyed on the larvae of two mosquito genera at different rates, which appeared to be related to prey behaviour. This study shows that anthropogenic landscape modification has an important effect on the natural biological control of mosquitoes. Vector control programmes and urban planning should attempt to integrate ecological theory when developing strategies to reduce mosquito populations. This would result in management strategies that are beneficial for both public health and biodiversity. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved

AB  - Coastal habitats are very fragile and specialized environments susceptible to human activities and therefore vegetation ecology studies are needed to predict responses to landscape monitoring. There is little information about plant species invading human-made habitats, and no study has been carried out in Turkey on plant species distributed on coastal revetments. Therefore, the present study aimed to present the findings of a survey of plant species in relation to habitat factors to coastal revetments in the city of Trabzon (northeastern Turkey) and to identify and suggest species for future landscaping and environmental remediation works. The fieldwork was undertaken within the boundaries of Trabzon province. Data were collected along three habitat types regarding coastal revetments obtaining a total of 1,277 taxa collected from 46 different revetment areas including 150 sample plots. So, 169 plant species were identified, three of which were the most frequent with high presence of Conyza canadensis L. (44.67 %), Clematis vitalba L. (24.67 %) and Daucus carota (22.67 %). Using descriptive statistics of different diversity indices for plant species present in the three revetment types, significant variations were found in Shannon's diversity index (H'), species richness index (R') and Pielou's evenness index (J'). The results of the regression analysis of relationships between habitat factors and diversity of species indicated that distance from the road and distance from the sea totally affected the diversity and distribution of the species on coastal revetments. Consequently, the ecological roles of the species on coastal revetments are discussed in the conservation and management context. Therefore, when selecting plants to be used in the landscaping of coastal areas and deciding where they should be planted, habitat factors should be considered to have a significant effect on the alpha diversity of plants that can be suggested.

AB  - Multifunctionality in urban ecosystems has received much attention in the last decade from researchers and policy makers. This paper provides research on urban multifunctional landscape clustering, using the city of Shenzhen, China, as a case study. Utilizing the self-organizing feature map (SOFM) neural network model, six different landscape functional indices were identified, and urban multifunctional landscape regionalization produced five major units. According to SOFM clustering results, each region had its respective primary function, such as gas regulation, water supply, human nature regulation, soil environmental regulation, economy, and cultural priority. The gas regulation ecological supporting region (Zone I) covers 490.5km2, with long coastline form a nature-dominated, less human-influenced physical environment; the water supply ecological supporting region (Zone II) is 25.8km2, and river network density reaches 0.986km/km2, supporting function of water conservation and water supply; the mountain forest environmental regulating region is Zone III, 377.7km2 with substantial forest cover; covering the largest area of 547.8km2, zone type (IV) represents soil regulation region; the fifth zone type (V), on the west coast, is definitely a human-dominated region. The results show that the human and nature interfaced peri-urban region is the most affected and threatened area in the city. Under the control of urban sprawling local regulation, the urban population growth would slow down, but there is no convincing evidence that the limitation of build up land have negative influence on the urban economy. Thereafter, the authors analyzed the functions of each unit and compared the SOFM clustering technique with the traditional K-means clustering method. The result revealed that both methods are effective and appropriate for regionalization of urban multifunctional landscapes, but SOFM has advantages in identifying spatial patterns. Finally, approaches to achieve sustainable urban development were illustrated and their importance highlighted for policymakers and stakeholders.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes are projected to threaten biodiversity over this century. However, few studies have considered the spatial and temporal overlap of these threats to evaluate how ongoing land-use change could affect species ranges projected to shift outside conservation areas. We evaluated climate change and urban development effects on vegetation distribution in the Southwest ecoregion, California Floristic Province, USA. We also evaluated how well a conservation network protects suitable habitat for rare plant species under these change projections and identified primary sources of uncertainty. We used consensus-based maps from three species distribution models (SDMs) to project current and future suitable habitat for 19 species representing different functional types (defined by fire-response - obligate seeders, resprouting shrubs - and life forms - herbs, subshrubs), and range sizes (large/common, small/rare). We used one spatially explicit urban growth projection; two climate models, emission scenarios, and probability thresholds applied to SDMs; and high-resolution (90m) environmental data. We projected that suitable habitat could disappear for 4 species and decrease for 15 by 2080. Averaged centroids of suitable habitat (all species) were projected to shift tens (up to hundreds) of kilometers. Herbs showed a small-projected response to climate change, while obligate seeders could suffer the greatest losses. Several rare species could lose suitable habitat inside conservation areas while increasing area outside. We concluded that (i) climate change is more important than urban development for vegetation habitat loss in this ecoregion through 2080 due to diminishing amounts of undeveloped private land in this region; (ii) the existing conservation plan, while extensive, may be inadequate to protect plant diversity under projected patterns of climate change and urban development, (iii) regional assessments of the dynamics of the drivers of biodiversity change based on high-resolution environmental data and consensus predictive mapping, such as this study, are necessary to identify the species expected to be the most vulnerable and to meaningfully inform regional-scale conservation.

AB  - Although urbanization is generally considered a major threat to local and global biodiversity, some recent studies have shown that urban environments provide suitable habitat for some wildlife species, including carnivores, yet little is known about the factors that determinate their occurrence and habitat preferences. The main aim of this study was to examine the relative importance of habitat characteristics in relation to carnivore occurrence along an urban-rural gradient in the Central Europe. Carnivore occurrence was monitored using scent stations (summer period) and snow tracking (winter period) in the regional city which was divided into the network of 154 quadrates (25 ha/quadrate) for the purposes of this study. From a total of six recorded native carnivore species, the stone marten Martes foina and the least weasel Mustela nivalis were the most dominant and widespread species in both study periods. PCA analysis revealed the existence of two informative axes corresponding to (A) urban vs. non-urban habitat and (B) residential vs. industrial areas. Surprisingly, the only species exhibiting marked habitat selectivity and avoidance of highly urbanized areas was the red fox (i.e. negative correlation with the first PCA axis). The stone marten tends to avoid industrial areas and prefers residential areas; however its presence/absence was not associated with the first PCA axis. On the other hand, the ermine stoat and the least weasel were relatively unselective according to our results. In conclusion, our results demonstrate high adaptability of various species of carnivore mesopredators to urban environment; however their response to the level of urbanization and habitat characteristics exhibits interspecific variation.

AB  - The city road system, as well as other complex systems, can be modeled as networks. Studies investigating the relationship between network structure and functionality provide a novel perspective to investigate the robustness of a city road network by analyzing its structure. The fact that different events may lead to different levels of traffic interruption requires that the investigation on the robustness of city road networks be conducted at multiple granularities. In this study, road networks are modeled at three different granularities: segment-based, stroke-based and community-based model to investigate the response of road networks under punctiform, linear and zonal traffic interruptions respectively. An empirical study with six city road networks around the world shows that the topological structure, especially the diversity level in the betweenness centrality distribution of the network, is more essential to the robustness of the city road network than geographical features and inherent attributes. The performances of city road networks under attacks are consistent in different cities due to the similarity in their topological structures but differ by granularity because city road networks modeled at different granularities have different topological structures. This variation illustrates that the robustness analysis of city road networks should be modeled at the appropriate granularity for a given traffic situation. Furthermore, empirical results suggest that the tolerance threshold for urban traffic is the critical point where the city road network begins to split into several components. The robustness analysis solution proposed in this article can identify these critical points to provide an early warning in urban traffic interruptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The molecular diversity of air-dispersed protists was examined through the 18S rRNA gene clone library construction in air samples and samples from experimental water containers passively collecting air-dispersed microorganisms, from July 2007 till October 2008 in three different sites of Northern Greece. The majority of the samplings took place in an urban industrialized coastal city (Thessaloniki). In all the samples, a total of 29 unique phylotypes were detected belonging to 10 known major taxonomic groups. The most abundant phylotypes were affiliated to known taxa of Ciliophora and Chlorophyceae, commonly found in various habitats. Additionally, various previously unnoticed and under-studied taxa, such as Bicosoecida, Oomycetes and Labyrinthulomycetes, were detected. These taxa are potentially important in ecological processes, through dispersal and colonization of various habitats. Multivariate statistical analysis associated the most abundant phylotypes with rainfall, suggesting that rain is a favorable means for reposition of air-dispersed protists. This is the first study investigating the molecular diversity of air-dispersed protists, including algae and heterotrophic protists. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization may threaten multiple ecosystem processes as well as biodiversity in ecological reserves due to the loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitats in unprotected areas, making it necessary to measure the interference effect of urban growth on the protected areas. This study develops an urban isolation index (UII) to quantify the isolation effects of land-use conversion on key ecological areas (KEAs) and accounts for urban patch size, morphology, location, and quality loss. Based on the five remote sensing Landsat images taken between 1980 and 2005, UII is applied to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the isolation effects caused by rapid urbanization in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the habitat isolation constantly intensified during the urbanization process. We identified spatially explicit information of critical urban domains that exerted an interference effect on KEAs. There are considerable differences of isolation effects resulting from different urban growth types. Urban edge expansion caused the greatest habitat isolation in Shenzhen. The outlying and infilling urban patches contributed minor isolation effects to the KEAs. This paper furthers the understanding of the ecological effects of urbanization processes and provides a spatially explicit identification for ecological conservation and restoration in rapidly urbanized regions.

AB  - From the late 1990s, the establishment of a new relational turn' in the study of world city connectedness in globalisation has run parallel to the wider relational turn occurring in economic geography. Early work, built firmly upon a qualitative approach to the collection and analyses of new intercity datasets, considered cities as being constituted by their relations with other cities. Subsequent research, however, would take a strong quantitative turn, best demonstrated through the articulation of the inter-locking world city network (ILWCN) model' for measuring relations between cities. In this paper, we develop a critique of research based around the ILWCN model, arguing that this top down' quantitative approach has now reached a theoretical impasse. To address this impasse, we argue for a move away from structural approaches in which the firm is the main unit of analysis, towards qualitative approaches in which individual agency and practice are afforded greater importance.

AB  - Green areas, also known as green infrastructure or urban vegetation, are vital to urbanites for their critical roles in mitigating urban heat island effects and climate change and for their provision of multiple ecosystem services and aesthetics. Here, I provide a high spatial resolution snapshot of the green cover distribution of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by incorporating the use of morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) as a tool to describe the spatial pattern and connectivity of the city's urban green areas. Analysis of a previously developed IKONOS 4-m spatial resolution classification of the city of San Juan from 2002 revealed a larger area of vegetation (green areas or green infrastructure) than previously estimated by moderate spatial resolution imagery. The city as a whole had approximately 42% green cover and 55% impervious surfaces. Although the city appeared greener in its southern upland sector compared to the northern coastal section, where most built-up urban areas occurred (66% impervious surfaces), northern San Juan had 677 ha more green area cover dispersed across the city than the southern component. MSPA revealed that most forest cover occurred as edges and cores, and green areas were most commonly forest cores, with larger predominance in the southern sector of the municipality. In dense, built-up, urban land, most of the green areas occurred in private yards as islets. When compared to other cities across the United States, San Juan was most similar in green cover features to Boston, Massachusetts, and Miami, Florida. Per capita green space for San Juan (122.2 m(2)/inhabitant) was also comparable to these two U. S. cities. This study explores the intra-urban vegetation variation in the city of San Juan, which is generally overlooked by moderate spatial resolution classifications in Puerto Rico. It serves as a starting point for green infrastructure mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the urban green spaces within the city of San Juan. The effectiveness of research and city planning will be further enhanced as a result of this type of finer-scale urban cover exploration.

AB  - It is widely accepted that riverine ecosystems are influenced by the landscape pattern changes of their corresponding watersheds, but few studies have identified the most sensitive and nonsensitive biotic indices, the most influential landscape metrics and the relationship between aquatic biota and landscape patterns. To address this problem, Taizi river basin of Northeast China is taken as a case study, in which GIS technology and landscape ecology method are adopted. The study is performed at both the basin scale (entire drainage area upstream from certain sample point) and the riparian scale (a certain width buffer on each side of sample point extending the length of drainage network) to direct future landscape pattern design at the corresponding scales. The results show that at the basin scale, the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrate (B-S) and the fish index of biotic integrity (F-IBI) are the most sensitive biotic indices to landscape metrics, whereas the species richness of phytoplankton (P-S), the Shannon-Weaver diversity index of phytoplankton (P-H), zooplankton (Z-H), benthic macroinvertebrate (B-H) and fish density (F-D) are not sensitive to landscape pattern changes; at the riparian scale, F-IBI, B-S and zooplankton density (Z-D) have significant correlations with 9 of 10 landscape metrics calculated in this study, whereas P-S, P-H, Z-H, B-H, F-D and species richness of fish have very low correlations with riparian landscape pattern changes. At the basin scale, no landscape pattern metrics show obviously more influence on the riverine ecosystems than other metrics. At the riparian scale, Shannon's diversity index is a very influential factor. As to both of the two scales, B-S and F-IBI are correlated with most landscape metrics. The information derived above can help understand the impacts of landscape change on river ecosystems more clearly and provide useful scientific information on river ecosystem protection from the viewpoint of landscape.

AB  - The regeneration of temperate forests is important, especially for those located in urban areas. Sources of propagules, such as seed rain, shape the structure and composition of systems where the availability of diaspores from forest species contribute to both local biodiversity and ecosystem services; these elements are crucial in Mexico City. Over the course of one year, we estimated natural regeneration potential through an analysis of the seed rain deposited in traps that were placed at soil level in plots in three vegetation types: oak, fir and pine forests. We addressed the following questions: Do abundance, density, species composition and diversity of seed rain differ among vegetation types and seasons? How similar is the seed rain to the standing vegetation? Is seed rain a potential source for the natural regeneration of temperate forests? The results showed that the abundance and density of seeds were significantly higher for oak and fir forests due to a higher number of herb, shrub, and tree species in the standing vegetation. The most abundant species in the total seed rain was Ageratina enixa (B.L. Rob.) R.M. King & H. Rob. (12%), but inside individual forest plots, the most abundant were Quercus rugosa Nee (16%), Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. (17.5%) and Pinus hartwegii Lindl. (41%). Diversity index values differed among vegetation types but not seasons. Most diaspores in the seed rain corresponded to native species (97%). The similarity between seed rain and the standing vegetation was 40%. In total, 62% of the species are anemochorous, as a result of the high number of Asteraceae species present, and endozoochory is the second most important (17%) dispersal syndrome. A slight asynchrony was observed between the peaks of anemochorous and zoochorous species.

AB  - The National Wildlife Federation's (NWF) Certified Wildlife Habitat (TM) program strives to provide habitat for wildlife, primarily in human-dominated landscapes. The main objective of our research project was to determine if yards certified in the NWF's program offered wildlife habitat not available in non-certified yards in the same neighborhood. A second objective was to validate the applications of certified landowners by examining habitat listed on their certification application relative to what was available in their yard.
   Our project focused on neighborhoods within the greater Orlando, Florida metropolitan area. We visited 50 certified yards, 50 neighboring, non-certified yards, and 50 non-adjacent, non-certified yards in the same neighborhood. To evaluate the yards, we used an ecological check-list to determine the quality and quantity of wildlife habitat in each yard. Based on the results of our study, there were significant differences in both quality and quantity of habitat found in certified versus non-certified yards. The Certified Wildlife Habitat (TM) program is successful in that yards in the NWF program offer wildlife habitat that is not available in non-certified yards. However, our biggest recommendation for the NWF program is that it needs to have a larger, more contiguous landscape scope. Certified yards need to be adjacent, or in close enough proximity to one another that they can act as a contiguous landscape in and of themselves, but also have connection to and coordination with other larger blocks of habitat.

AB  - Aim Evidence linking the accumulation of exotic species to the suppression of native diversity is equivocal, often relying on data from studies that have used different methods. Plot-level studies often attribute inverse relationships between native and exotic diversity to competition, but regional abiotic filters, including anthropogenic influences, can produce similar patterns. We seek to test these alternatives using identical scale-dependent sampling protocols in multiple grasslands on two continents. Location Thirty-two grassland sites in North America and Australia. Methods We use multiscale observational data, collected identically in grain and extent at each site, to test the association of local and regional factors with the plot-level richness and abundance of native and exotic plants. Sites captured environmental and anthropogenic gradients including land-use intensity, human population density, light and soil resources, climate and elevation. Site selection occurred independently of exotic diversity, meaning that the numbers of exotic species varied randomly thereby reducing potential biases if only highly invaded sites were chosen. Results Regional factors associated directly or indirectly with human activity had the strongest associations with plot-level diversity. These regional drivers had divergent effects: urban-based economic activity was associated with high exotic:native diversity ratios; climate- and landscape-based indicators of lower human population density were associated with low exotic:native ratios. Negative correlations between plot-level native and exotic diversity, a potential signature of competitive interactions, were not prevalent; this result did not change along gradients of productivity or heterogeneity. Main conclusion We show that plot-level diversity of native and exotic plants are more consistently associated with regional-scale factors relating to urbanization and climate suitability than measures indicative of competition. These findings clarify the long-standing difficulty in resolving drivers of exotic diversity using single-factor mechanisms, suggesting that multiple interacting anthropogenic-based processes best explain the accumulation of exotic diversity in modern landscapes.

AB  - We live in an era of increasing connectivity in human societies and in technology. These structural changes in the ways we interact with each other and with increasingly ubiquitous computational and communication devices have been formalized in research across several disciplines through the dynamics of complex informational networks. Complex networks are (mathematical) graphs, connecting nodes (people, computers) via edges (relationships, wires). While much progress in methods for network analysis has been achieved, the fundamental principles that drive network growth in human societies and in worldwide computer networks remain rather obscure. Mechanistic models for the origin of certain structural graph elements have now become common, but the formal connection between large empirical studies of network evolution and fundamental concepts of information, learning, and social theory remains only latent. To address these issues, I argue here that the most interesting aspect of the dynamics of informational networks in complex systems is that they are the physical manifestations of processes of evolution, inference, and learning, from natural ecosystems, to cities and to online environments. I formalize the general problem of learning and computation in network environments in terms of average structural network changes and propose a conceptual framework to explain the transition from initially static, undifferentiated, and information-poor environments to dynamical, richly diverse, and interconnected systems. I illustrate these ideas empirically by providing examples from cities, and from global computer networks and webs of documents. I finish with an overview of expected changes to urban form and function and to computational hardware under likely technological scenarios.

AB  - Climate change impacts many species through shifts in habitat. The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The trees of parks and gardens support many species, the survival of urban-dwelling species mainly bird species. Birds amongst other species provide a wide range of environmental and social functions to cities and urban dwellers. The present study aims to know bird diversity in two parks as bioindicator of automobile air pollution exposure, landscape changes and/or human interactions. The study areas were selected as per heavily-populated neighborhoods, nearby office buildings, nearby roads and continuous vehicular movements, human interactions as visitors, where high levels of human disturbance are common. The study was carried out at 2 sampling stations viz (i) Elliot park and (ii) Agri-horticulture Society. The bird species diversity was studied by qualitative and quantitative assessment. Indices were Species richness, Index of Dominance, Relative abundance, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index and Evenness Index for birds for all selected sites were calculated using the statistical formulae. The present results as bioindicators bird species clearly indicate that the bird species are very few in numbers in both the parks. When comparison made between both the parks, it was observed less number of bird varieties (16 types) in Elliot park than varieties (9 types) more less in number in Agri-horticulture society. This study is a preliminary assessment of bird diversity but further researches are needed in relation to biochemical and genetic damage study as well as air pollution load by using instruments. In the present study it was concluded that the less numbers of birds and their different diversity indices were found a decreasing trends, though there no attempt has been made on physico-chemical properties of present air pollutants. The less number of varieties of bird species are as tolerant bioindicators, which may be due to the vehicular pollution and/or human interference and/or landscape changes due to nearby neighborhood blocks, office and residential buildings, continuous movement of vehicles etc.

AB  - Urbanization causes widespread endangerment of biodiversity worldwide. However, some species successfully colonize cities reaching higher densities than in their rural habitats. In these cases, although urban city dwellers may apparently be taking advantage of these new environments, they also face new ecological conditions that may induce behavioural changes. For example, the frequency of alternative reproductive behaviours such as extra-pair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism might increase with breeding densities. Here, using a panel of 17 microsatellites, we tested whether increments in breeding densities such as those associated with urban invasion processes alter genetic monogamy in the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia. Our results show low rates of extra-pair paternity (1.47%), but relatively high levels of intraspecific brood parasitism (8.82%). However, we were not able to detect differences in the frequency at which either alternative reproductive behaviour occurs along a strong breeding density gradient. Further research is needed to properly ascertain the role of other social and ecological factors in the frequency at which this species presents alternative reproductive strategies. Meanwhile, our results suggest that genetic monogamy is maintained despite the increment in conspecific density associated with a recent urban invasion process.

AB  - Urbanization drastically alters natural ecosystems and the structure of their plant and animal communities. Whereas some species cope successfully with these environmental changes, others may go extinct. In the case of parasite communities, the expansion of urban areas has a critical effect by changing the availability of suitable substrates for the eggs or free-larval stages of those species with direct life cycles or for the range of hosts of those species with complex cycles. In this study we investigated the influence of the degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity on helminth richness, abundance and community structure of rufous-bellied thrushes (Turdus rufiventris) along a rural-urban gradient in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This common native bird species of southern Brazil hosts 15 endoparasite species at the study region. A total of 144 thrushes were collected with mist nets at 11 sites. The degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity were estimated by quantifying five landscape elements: buildings, woodlands, fields, bare lands, and water. Landscape analyses were performed at two spatial scales (10 and 100 ha) taking into account home range size and the potential dispersal distance of thrushes and their prey (intermediate hosts). Mean parasite richness showed an inverse relationship with the degree of urbanization, but a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity. Changes in the structure of component communities along the rural-urban gradient resulted from responses to the availability of particular landscape elements that are compatible with the parasites' life cycles. We found that the replacement of natural environments with buildings breaks up host-parasite interactions, whereas a higher environmental (substrate) diversity allows the survival of a wider range of intermediate hosts and vectors and their associated parasites.

AB  - Monitoring of urban growth and the characterization of its patterns in the Wuhan area of central China from 1988 to 2013 was performed using an integrated approach of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques and statistical methods. We also undertook a qualitative analysis of the impact of urban growth on landscape ecological security. The results showed that the Wuhan area was in a rapid process of urbanization between 2000 and 2011, with an average urban growth rate of 10.666 km(2)/a and 2.969 km(2)/a in the surrounding region and city proper, respectively. An aggregated pattern was the primary growth type in the whole study area, while linear and leapfrog patterns mainly occurred in the surrounding region. Rapid urban growth has aggravated the landscape fragmentation and has led to considerable declines in ecosystem services. A Pearson correlation analysis was used to qualitatively explore the relationships between the urban growth patterns and the factors associated with ecological security. It was found that the ecosystem fragmentation and ecosystem services were correlated with the urban growth rate, the three types of urban growth, and the compactness of the urban form. Of the three growth types, the leapfrog growth pattern destroys the integrity of water bodies, thereby preventing the connection of lakes to the main surface water network, and thus results in increase fragmentation and reduction of ecosystem services. Although the land-use policies implemented in Wuhan during the study period have promoted the development of the local economy, they have failed to protect the ecosystem. Urban growth speed should be effectively controlled because natural resource protection is as important as, and even more important, to some extent, than encouraging extensive economic development. This research has highlighted the importance of the joint application of urban growth quantification and the monitoring of the changes in the factors associated with ecological security in landscape planning.

AB  - Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.

AB  - Intense urban and agricultural development alters habitats, increases fragmentation, and may decouple trophic interactions if plants or animals cannot disperse to needed resources. Specialist insects represent a substantial proportion of global biodiversity and their fidelity to discrete microhabitats provides a powerful framework for investigating organismal responses to human land use. We sampled site occupancy and densities for two plant-herbivore-parasitoid systems from 250 sites across a 360 km(2) urban/agricultural landscape to ask whether and how human development decouples interactions between trophic levels. We compared patterns of site occupancy, host plant density, herbivory and parasitism rates of insects at two trophic levels with respect to landcover at multiple spatial scales. Geospatial analyses were used to identify landcover characters predictive of insect distributions. We found that herbivorous insect densities were decoupled from host tree densities in urban landcover types at several spatial scales. This effect was amplified for the third trophic level in one of the two insect systems: despite being abundant regionally, a parasitoid species was absent from all urban/suburban landcover even where its herbivore host was common. Our results indicate that human land use patterns limit distributions of specialist insects. Dispersal constraints associated with urban built development are specifically implicated as a limiting factor.

TI  - Centrality and urban transformations: An exploration of the process of live centrality in water related Cities in Southern Chile

KW  - NETWORK ANALYSIS
AB  - Rapid urbanization is placing cities of the global south at the core of the developmental agenda of the twenty-first century. This intense transformation process poses both challenges and opportunities for thinking and acting on the future of cities. In Latin America, this process has modified and increased the scale of the urban environment by occupying extensive landscapes towards the periphery of urban areas. On top of that, the current urbanization models generally promote the development of spatial relationships that are detrimental to the environmental and social sustainability of cities. Thus a physical and morpohological deterioration of cities is observed, especially in their central areas.
   The center of a city is usually defined by a higher concentration and mix of land uses and related activities in a prominent location within the urban area. Historically, it is understood that centers grow, shrink, shift and diversify; and their limits are often diffuse within the territory. The need for city centers to be revitalized has drawn attention to how little is known of the process by which centers are generated and sustained. The challenge is to understand centrality as an everchanging process determined by the relationships between activity and movement.
   The aim of this paper is to explore a key aspect of centrality: the concept of 'live centrality', which is characterized by the presence of uses such as retail, markets, catering and entertainment, as well as other activities which usually benefit from the movement of people. The case study for the analysis presented here is based on Valdivia, a midsize fluvial city in southern Chile.
   The research is based on the process of 'movement economy', using space syntax as method to explore the spatial patterns and activities that exist in the city. A syntactic analysis of Valdivia was performed using Dephmap. A GIS platform was then used to perform a spatial analysis of the data gathered. The study explores how different spatial configurations are influenced by the process of live centrality and how this plays a critical role in the formation and location of centers, both at a local and city scale. Also, the presence of different activities that define a centrality are identified and measure.
   Results indicate that retail activities tend to concentrate around areas of a higher morphological integration. Furthermore, a high correlation is observed between the distribution of these activities and the location of the topological center of the city. Finally, integration analysis demonstrates that the location of the historical city center does not coincide with the topological center, thus confirming the hypothesis that the expansion of the city is linked to morphological deficiencies of their centrality process.

AB  - The Cape Dwarf Chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, is threatened by extensive habitat loss and transformation in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. As a result, the species exists as a collection of populations inhabiting an increasingly fragmented landscape within a critically endangered ecosystem. In this study we monitored microsatellite genetic variation in one of these populations of B. pumilum across a three-year period. From the results of a temporary site-vacancy of adult chameleons during the study, we anticipated a significant shift in microsatellite allele frequencies. Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies. Pairwise tests of year by year comparisons revealed significant shifts in allelic frequencies between years one and two and between one and three, but not between years two and three. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of small vertebrates to stochastic changes in the allelic composition of populations in a fragmented landscape, and can be useful for the development of biodiversity management in an increasingly fragmented habitat mosaic.

KW  - Urban Growth
AB  - In recent decades, cities have grown with no plan and urban boundaries have reached to extend several times bigger than its original ones during a short period of time. This problematic issue caused to negative phenomenon of urban dispersion. Also it is the source of many problems in cities in developing countries. Thus, studying the urban extension pattern is one of the issues which can provide the development strategy in order to empower the urban management in long-term. Tehran as the capital city of Iran in terms of physical growth and development had a slow growth and low compaction in the past. However, by the onset of rapid urbanization and uncontrolled rural to urban migration growth, its area has grown rapidly. It can be expected the horizontal growth pattern and urban dispersion, although the tendency to concentration and compression in recent years is observed. Regarding the major impact of the physical development pattern of each city on the stability or instability of its development, managers, administrators and urban planners must have sufficient knowledge about available physical development and physical growth of cities in order to guide this pattern to urban sustainable development. The aim of the present study is to determine the pattern of spatial extension of district 13 of Tehran city during 2006 to 2011, as well as providing solutions to achieve an optimized and sustainable city growth pattern. The research is through descriptive and analytical method as documents studies, library studies and fieldwork surveys, with considering the area, population and residential density indicates by using Holdren and Shannon Entropy as an applied method to systematic analysis of urban growth pattern in recent years. The results based on the present studies show that in the case study, the area has grown dispersal and it has caused negative occurrence of urban dispersion. Since the trend of physical expansion of city and region will continue in the case study, undoubtedly, it will be necessary to allocate some parts of open areas for construction. If its future expansion is not considered to be planned, indeed not in a long future, the region will face a lot of problems and issues which may cause loss of citizens' welfare and failure to achieve a healthy city. Therefore, by coordinating the growth of other land uses along with residential land use growth, we can help the balanced urban growth. Accordingly, we must use the pattern of concentrated development within the inner texture ( intensive and vertical) and also changing the land use of some parts of air force military land belongings in order to have a logical trend for physical development of the region.

AB  - In this study we evaluated whether pteridophytes are reliable indicators of urban forest integrity. We inventoried the total pteridophyte diversity in 82 forest patches of the Hochelaga Archipelago (Montreal area, Quebec, Canada), and evaluated their level of integrity using landscape metrics (e.g., area, connectivity, matrix composition) calculated from satellite imagery and land use maps. To obtain information at microhabitat scale, we sampled pteridophyte diversity, as well as biotic and abiotic data, in 225 sample plots within these 82 patches. Relationships of pteridophyte richness to landscape metrics and to microhabitat variables were analyzed with parsimonious regression models. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the effects of each group of variables (forest area, land use, biotic/abiotic and edge effect). To enhance the interpretation of models involving richness, distance-based redundancy analyses of species composition data were performed. Indicator species of low and high levels of urban influence were then identified using the IndVal method. Results showed a strong species-area relationship that was influenced by surrounding land use. Pteridophyte richness decreased with increasing proportions of residential areas, urban heat islands (UHI) and water bodies in a 500 m-buffer zone around patches. Greater richness at the microhabitat scale was associated to greater distance from internal and external edges. Out of 38 species, 19 were significant indicators of low levels of urban influence. We conclude that pteridophytes are positive indicator of forest integrity, since they demonstrate typical plant responses to adverse urban-generated ecological conditions. Green-spored species are of particular interest, since their presence indicates low levels of UHIs. Impact of global climate changes on biodiversity can be predicted by studying UHls, and we suggest using pteridophytes in this broader context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

AB  - A city's common spaces are appropriated by capital that aims to guarantee the conditions necessary for the production-reproduction of capitalist relations. In this context, the challenge is to imagine and construct a very different type of city capable of breaking away from the dynamic of capital, founded on new forms of appropriation of the city, which implies articulating both theory and praxis. For this to occur, however, it is necessary to create new knowledge about the city and a strong anti-capitalist social movement focused on the transformation of daily urban life and involving new forms of appropriation of urban common spaces. It is in this context, and from a dialectic perspective, that this article articulates the ideas of Henri Lefebvre and David Harvey, seeking to contribute to an understanding of the production processes of space in contemporary capitalism, the discussion of the future of cities and perspectives on transition. To do so, the article addresses four central ideas: (i) the dialectic conception of space to problematize the production and appropriation of urban common spaces; (ii) the recognition of urban common spaces as spaces traversed by contradictions, disputes and material and symbolic conflicts among different agents; (iii) the right to the city as a need and as a utopian project; and (iv) the challenge of articulating heterotopic practices from the perspective of creative rebellion for the right to the city and the transition to a new urban future.

AB  - The paper explores the strategic role that urban biodiversity and ecosystem services management, natural infrastructure and adaptive governance approaches can play in making our economies and societies more resilient and in linking human societies and the natural environment. Resilience - a concept that entered the debate on urban governance - means the ability of urban systems, considered as linear-systems, to react to external disturbances by returning to some socio-ecological equilibrium steady-state by overcoming a crisis period (Gunderson & al. 2010, Newman & al. 2009). In this view, green infrastructures can assume a strategic role in restoring and enhancing the ecological and environmental livability in urban areas. Starting from the International and European context, the paper discusses innovative programs and interdisciplinary projects and practices (some cases in Turin Metropolitan Area) to demonstrate how green infrastructures can increase the adaptive capacity of urban systems in term of resilience. They can contribute to increase the ability of European cities to adapt to climate change and to reduce their ecological footprints, to enhance security and life quality.

AB  - Background: The increased incidence of Lyme disease in Europe necessitates permanent monitoring of the occurrence and activity of its vector. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the presence and seasonal activity of Ixodes ricinus ticks in various habitats of a large industrial region in south-western Poland in correlation with environmental factors present in urban heat islands. Additionally, the risk of borreliosis in this part of Poland has been assessed.
   Methods: The investigations were carried out at two-week intervals between April and October 2001 and 2002. Ticks were collected from four localities in Upper Silesia, i.e. in a city park (CH), on the outskirts of two large cities (KO, MI), and in a forest (KL). We analysed the impact of temperature and humidity measured during the collection period in the I. ricinus habitats, the climatic conditions prevailing in the study area, and the degree of environmental contamination on the abundance and activity of these ticks in the respective sites. The degree of borreliosis risk in the region was determined on the basis of the results of research on the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. in ticks and reports from sanitary-epidemiological stations.
   Results: In total, 2061 I. ricinus ticks, including 606 nymphs and 1455 adults, were collected in the study area. The number and activity of the ticks varied during the collection in the different sites. In the urban locality CH, tick abundance was the lowest (455 throughout the investigation period), and the seasonal activity of females was unimodal and persisted for as long as 4 months. In the suburban localities KO and MI, tick abundance was higher (485 and 481 specimens, respectively) and the activity of females was unimodal. The highest abundance (640 ticks) and a bimodal pattern of female activity were reported from the forest locality KL. In all the localities, the activity of nymphs was unimodal. Humidity was found to be a factor influencing I. ricinus abundance and activity, whereas temperature did not affect their number and behaviour significantly. The climate parameters within the urban heat islands noted during the investigations contributed to dispersal of dust and gas pollutants. The analysis of the data reveals that there is a risk of borreliosis in the entire study area; however, it is higher in the urban localities than in the suburban sites.
   Conclusions: Environmental conditions (habitat, climate, and dust and gas pollution) prevailing within urban heat islands may exert an impact on tick abundance and activity and the prevalence of Lyme disease in the study area. The greatest effect of the environmental factors on ticks was found in the city park, where the risk of human infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes is the highest as well.

AB  - Severe fragmentation is a typical fate of native remnant habitats in cities, and urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability are predicted to lose genetic variation in isolated urban patches. However, little information exists on the characteristics of urban green spaces required to conserve genetic variation. In this study, we examine whether isolation in New York City (NYC) parks results in genetic bottlenecks in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), and test the hypotheses that park size and time since isolation are associated with genetic variability using nonlinear regression and information-theoretic model selection. White-footed mice have previously been documented to exhibit male-biased dispersal, which may create disparities in genetic variation between males and females in urban parks. We use genotypes of 18 neutral microsatellite data and four different statistical tests to assess this prediction. Given that sex-biased dispersal may create disparities between population genetic patterns inferred from bi-vs. uni-parentally inherited markers, we also sequenced a 324 bp segment of the mitochondrial D-loop for independent inferences of historical demography in urban P. leucopus. We report that isolation in urban parks does not necessarily result in genetic bottlenecks; only three out of 14 populations in NYC parks exhibited a signature of a recent bottleneck at 18 neutral microsatellite loci. Mouse populations in larger urban parks, or parks that have been isolated for shorter periods of time, also do not generally contain greater genetic variation than populations in smaller parks. These results suggest that even small networks of green spaces may be sufficient to maintain the evolutionary potential of native species with certain characteristics. We also found that isolation in urban parks results in weak to nonexistent sex-biased dispersal in a species known to exhibit male-biased dispersal in less fragmented environments. In contrast to nuclear loci, mitochondrial D-loop haplotypes exhibited a mutational pattern of demographic expansion after a recent bottleneck or selective sweep. Estimates of the timing of this expansion suggest that it occurred concurrent with urbanization of NYC over the last few dozens to hundreds of years. Given the general non-neutrality of mtDNA in many systems and evidence of selection on related coding sequences in urban P. leucopus, we argue that the P. leucopus mitochondrial genome experienced recent negative selection against haplotypes not favored in isolated urban parks. In general, rapid adaptive evolution driven by urbanization, global climate change, and other human-caused factors is underappreciated by evolutionary biologists, but many more cases will likely be documented in the near future.

AB  - the rapid growth of cellphone users in cities enable the cellphone towers spread all over urban area in past years. The user call logs, which refer to users movement trajectory in urban area, can provide an opportunity to understand urban spatial structure. As the extraction of more popular channel of human movement in urban area, the hot lines highlighted the spatial morphology of human flows in urban structure. In this paper, we propose popularity index that utilizes diversity and density index of channel to identify the hot lines based on cellphone call detail record dataset. The density of cellphone users that travel across one channel and the diversity of travel behaviors from different cellphone users refer to one channel has been combined to infer the level of popularity index for each channel. In the case study, a call detail record dataset that generated from the users of an anonymous telecom in Wuhan has been applied to identify the hot lines. The results showed the effectiveness of our approach and can be used as references for more explicitly representing urban dynamics to support urban plan applications.

AB  - According to the national policy, overall forest and agroforestry cover in Rwanda is to increase up to 30% land cover by 2020. On the other hand, demographic data reveal that Rwanda's urban areas are among the fastest-growing on the continent. Unfortunately, there is only little information of the effects of such a rapid urbanization on tree cover and green space structure, knowing that data on urban plant assemblages in the country are rather rare. The paper discusses developments in Kigali's green spaces with regard to its rapid rate of expansion. An integrated approach of research, combining results from interview sessions, desk-based investigations, walk-over and vegetation surveys, and photogrammetric analyses of remotely acquired imagery was applied. The findings suggest that the city green space network consists of plant assemblages largely dominated by alien species (75%). Tree cover fraction averaged at around 10-35%. No significant difference was observed between field-drawn and photogrammetric-based fraction of tree cover estimates; making the later a quick but cheap tool for rapid tree cover evaluation. Cultivated forests, urban woodlots and domestic garden tree stands are far the most dominant types of green spaces in terms of coverage of city surface area. Street tree communities and institutional gardens appear to be the most intensively designed green space layouts. Both distribution and species composition in domestic gardens were socioeconomic-driven. For instance, palm trees were characteristic of fortunate quarters while fruitbearing ornamental such as Psidium guajava and Persea americana were common within scattered and informal settlements. Markhamia lutea, Erythina abyssinica, Euphorbia candelabrum, Phoenix reclinata and Acacia sieberiana are among native taxa that thrive to keep a place in the city. Euphorbia tirucalli, a native tree that is widespread in home compound fences within informal settlements, is significantly declining as modern housing expands and concrete-based fences replace live enclosures.

AB  - The widespread urbanization of river catchments has resulted in the degradation of many fluvial ecosystems. We examined the hypothesis that riparian vegetation corridors form effective buffers, mitigating the effects of anthropogenic disturbances in urban river systems. We aimed to identify the principal factors affecting ecological status and biological diversity in the River Corgo (northern Portugal) in order to develop a programme of rehabilitation measures. Data were collected from urban reaches and downstream rural reaches of the River Corgo. We assessed the habitat preferences of two native cyprinid fish species Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Luciobarbus bocagei and also sampled the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna, physicochemical characteristics and hydromorphological support elements following Water Framework Directive compliant protocols. Fish habitat preference curves indicated that the specific habitat preferences of the target native cyprinid fish species were influenced by riparian zone vegetation quality, in addition to micro-habitat characteristics (substrate, current velocity and shelter). Sampling sites located in the urban centre were found to have higher ecological status than sites located in downstream rural and agricultural areas. This may reflect the increased habitat quality and buffering capacity of riparian vegetation, which was better preserved at urban sites. Despite this, non-native fish species were more abundant within urban sites compared to downstream rural sites. The results indicate the significant cumulative effect of anthropogenic influences on downstream sites, such as diffuse pollution from agriculture and loss of riparian cover. Based on the results of this study we recommend that rehabilitation measures should be directed to: a) improve the connectivity of the flowing channel in urban reaches; and b) restore the riparian corridor in the other reaches affected by nutrient input and the spread of invasive fish species.

AB  - Heavily engineered urban rivers suffer from a lack of riparian habitat that compromises the diversity and composition of plant assemblages that could exist within such ecosystems. Ecological engineering techniques may be a valuable way of facilitating a greater range of species to exist on artificial surfaces such as flood defence walls, where other habitat enhancement opportunities are severely limited. The first step in determining the applicability of wall modifications is to establish what the potential species pool might be. In this study, coir seed traps were established at 12 sites along the River Thames through central London to determine the diversity and composition of the seeds deposited in comparison to those species spontaneously colonising the walls. Limited similarity (47% overall, mean of 20 % per site) of species was recorded, indicating that there is substantial opportunity for improvement of the wall flora if suitable habitat could be provided. Coir acted as effective seed traps, though deposition was influenced by trap height on the wall surface and distance downstream. Coir may therefore act as an effective medium for seed trapping and germination within particular environmental boundaries, for the improvement of flood defence walls using ecological engineering modifications.

AB  - Riverine connectivity is important to the persistence of fish communities, but culverts may impede fish movements to varying degrees and in both directions. Baffles can be installed in culverts to mitigate upstream connectivity loss; however, evaluation of their effectiveness is limited. To examine the potential impacts of culverts and their potential rehabilitation with baffles, we sampled fish populations in 26 streams that contained either (i) nonbaffled culverts or (ii) baffled culverts or (iii) lacked culverts (reference streams) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Using mixed effects models, we compared fish responses across these three stream types to infer effects at the whole-stream scale (i.e., over both upstream and downstream positions equally), the within-stream scale (i.e., upstream versus downstream of culverts), and the interaction of scales. Densities (n.m(-2)) of coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) were significantly lower in nonbaffled and baffled stream types than in reference stream types, while densities of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were significantly lower in reference stream types, indicating whole-stream differences. Using multivariate statistics, we similarly found that fish community compositions were significantly different across stream types. For our various fish responses, we found no interaction between stream type and upstream or downstream position. Further, we found reaches directly downstream of baffled culverts had greater fish biomass and that overall species richness increased with age of baffles. These data suggest that culverts may drive changes in fish populations at whole-stream scales, and restoration of these effects with baffles may take decades.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the importance of the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA) for the forest remnants maintenance in the city of Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A forest remnants map was made using aerial photographs from 2006, and hydrographic and slope maps were used to PPA determination. Two scenarios were compared with landscape metrics: real (with current forest) and ideal ( current forest adding the PPA restoration). The results showed that 19% of the city territory were classified as PPA, and from this area, only 45% have forest cover. The preserved PPA represents 50% of all forest cover in the landscape. Restoring the PPA would increase from 16.68% to 28% of forest cover landscape and enable the emergence of fragments larger than 3,000 ha. In the real scenario, the bigger fragments have 300 ha. The presence of forest remnants is closely related to PPA areas: riverbanks, floodplains and hillside, where urban occupation was hampered and there is legal protection. The situation shows that the PPA play a fundamental role in forest patches conservation in a largely urbanized city, where natural areas support pressure. The evaluation of the scenarios showed that the incorporation of the legal provisions in planning and territorial ordering subsides the strategies for the maintenance of natural habitats and, consequently the reduction of the negative effects on biodiversity. However, the recent changes in Forest Code may represent a retrocession in the environmental scenario against to the increasing urbanization.

T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA  - English
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that ponds contribute a great deal to biodiversity at a regional level as networks of habitat patches that also act as 'stepping stones' to facilitate the movement of species through the landscape. Similarly, a great deal of biodiversity persists in urban environments where synanthropic communities are supplemented by species that thrive in disturbed environments. Aquatic urban biodiversity appears to persist despite anthropogenic stressors: an array of anthropogenic pollutants (road salt and heavy metals), invasive species, and active mismanagement-particularly the removal of riparian vegetation. Optimizing urban ponds for different ecosystem services results in conflicting priorities over hydrological, geochemical, ecological, aesthetic, and cultural functions. The socio-ecosystem approach to environmental management opens a path to greater incorporation of biodiversity into town planning and sustainability, while accounting for cultural attitudes to urban ecosystems. I identify a range of research needs: (1) the roles of design and location of urban ponds in influencing biodiversity, (2) the function of urban wetlands for stormwater and pollution management, and (3) public perceptions of urban ecosystems and how those perceptions are influenced by interactions with natural systems. Urban wetlands offer an important opportunity to educate the general public on natural systems and science in general using a resource that is located on their doorstep. In the face of increasing pressures on natural systems and increasing extent and intensity of urbanization, a more comprehensive appreciation of the challenges and opportunities provided by urban ponds could play a substantial role in driving sustainable urban development.

AB  - Light pollution can reduce night time drift of larval aquatic insects in urban streams by disrupting their circadian rhythms. Previous studies on larval insect drift show that disruption in drift leads to changes in reproduction as well as intraspecific and interspecific interactions. The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into the effects of extreme artificial light on insect drift in urbanized, high clarity spring systems of the karst Edwards Plateau, TX. We quantified taxa richness, diversity, and abundance in aquatic insect night time drift under two treatments (ambient night time light and artificial light addition) and among five streams using a paired design. Richness and diversity of drifting aquatic insects were similar between treatments but abundance was 37% less in the light addition treatment than that of the control. Effects of light addition on mean abundance was more notable in large streams with a 58% decrease in Simuliidae (compared to that of the control) and 51% decrease in Baetidae. Reduced drift from light addition suggests the potential of artificial lighting disrupting insect drift and consequently community structure. Results of this experiment support a growing body of knowledge on how urbanized systems influence stream communities.

AB  - Conservation fences have been used as a tool to stop threatening processes from acting against endangered wildlife, yet little is known of the impacts of fences on non-target native species. In this study, we intensively monitored a pest-exclusion fence for 16 months to assess impacts on a reptile community in south-eastern Australia. We registered 1052 reptile records of six species along the fence. Encounters and mortality were greatest for eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis), whereas impacts on lizards (Tiliqua rugosa, Tiliqua scincoides, Pogona barbata, Egernia cunninghami) and snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) were more moderate. We recorded several Chelodina longicollis recaptures at the fence and many of these were later found dead at the fence, indicating persistent attempts to navigate past the fence. We conservatively estimate that the fence resulted in the death of 3.3% and disrupted movements of 20.9% of the turtle population within the enclosure. Movement disruption and high mortality were also observed for turtles attempting to enter the nature reserve, effectively isolating the reserve population from others in the wider landscape. Of 98 turtle mortalities, the most common cause of death was overheating, followed by predation, vehicular collision, and entanglement. Turtle interactions were clustered in areas with more wetlands and less urban development, and temporally correlated with high rainfall and solar radiation, and low temperature. Thus, managers could focus at times and locations to mitigate impacts on turtles. We believe the impact of fences on non-target species is a widespread and unrecognized threat, and suggest that future and on-going conservation fencing projects consider risks to non-target native species, and where possible, apply mitigation strategies that maintain natural movement corridors and minimize mortality risk.

AB  - Discussions related to contemporary religious diversity in urban contexts often presume that people who form part of the public life of cities are citizens or have the right to move and dwell in the city. This article reminds us that when asking how certain religious movements become public in European cities, we also need to ask how possibilities of becoming public are tied to exclusionary citizenship regimes. By way of research among undocumented Brazilian migrants who attend Pentecostal churches, this article argues that contemporary European transformations of citizenship regimes influence religious perceptions of dwelling and movement within Europe and current experiences of urban space. The opportunities for undocumented Brazilians that allow them to move or to stay somewhere are dependent on legislation, the functioning of state institutions, the family's origins, and on contingency. In the experience of Brazilian Pentecostal adherents, acquiring legal status, to dwell or to be able to remain mobile within this assemblage of processes is dependent on their relationship with God. This article contributes to discussions in mobility studies and the geography of religion that highlight the need for more attention on mobility and stasis in relation to state actors.

AB  - This paper asserts that activists can carve out a political space between cooptation and autonomy in neoliberalizing cities but that strategic options vary according to the micro-political spaces activists operate in. This assertion is examined through an in-depth ethnographic study of two trailer encampments in Berlin. These trailer encampments occupy previously abandoned wastelands in Berlin and have strong ties to the squatter movement. The dominant discourse of the 'creative city' has served as both constraint and opportunity. Activist-residents in both camps are conscious that their abilities to maintain their communities require them to present themselves in a way that coincides with the dominant 'creativity' discourse of the city. Both have fashioned their own discursive frames and introduced events that demonstrate how they contribute to making Berlin dynamic and creative. However, the encampment in the conservative district faces more severe constraints than the one in the left-wing district. These constraints have favored a strategy that stresses identification with the governing urban norms. We conclude by arguing that using 'creativity' as a strategic frame may provide rights for some, but also reproduces a neoliberal model of citizenship that rights need to be earned by demonstrating deservingness in the city. Those lacking cultural resources have greater difficulty asserting their deservingness of rights and therefore face greater risk of marginalization and displacement.

AB  - The vegetation of the Cerrado, also known as the Brazilian savanna, is rapidly being replaced by agricultural and urban areas. The scope of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the reduction in savanna vegetation and the occurrence of nests of stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini), particularly those of the genus Melipona Illiger. We mapped 33 surveys of stingless bees nests located in Cerrado areas (25 sampled by us and 8 from literature) on Landsat images and assessed the proportions of vegetated, urban and rural areas within a radius of 3 km from each nest. We performed two-step cluster analyses separately for common and rare Meliponini species and Melipona species and assessed the proportion of vegetation in the resulting clusters. Common species such as Trigona spinipes Fabricius and Tetragonisca angustula Latreille were frequent in areas surrounded by vegetation as well as in degraded surround areas. Some species, such as Oxytrigona tataira Smith, occurred predominantly in degraded areas. Most Melipona species were uncommon or absent in the degraded areas. It is possible that isolated trees in rural landscapes provide functional connectivity for opportunistic species of stingless bees but not for susceptible species such as species of Melipona. This study is one of the first to attempt to understand the effects of the loss of Cerrado vegetation on the occurrence of stingless bees' nests.

AB  - Measuring functional coherence in metropolitan regions, in particular polycentric ones, requires taking the issues of multiplexity and individual level heterogeneity more explicitly into account, as the spatial organisation of functional linkages is not necessarily identical. Based on the analysis of one type of functional linkage a region can appear to be integrated, but loosely connected based on another. We demonstrate the occurrence of multiplexity for the polycentric Dutch Randstad region, and focus particularly on the presence of individual level heterogeneity. Commuting patterns in the Randstad are strongly related to socio-demographic variables and firm characteristics largely determine the scale of buyer-supplier relationships. We present studies into functional coherence in the Randstad, and assess whether methods, including the interlocking network model, are sufficiently capable of accounting for multiplexity and individual level heterogeneity.

AB  - The dispersal flights of West Indian drywood termite, Cryptotermes brevis (Walker) (Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) were surveyed in the major cities of Azores. The sampling device used to estimate termite density consisted of a yellow adhesive trap (size 45 by 24 cm), placed with an artificial or natural light source in a dark attic environment. In addition, data from two other projects were used to improve the knowledge about the geographical distribution of the species. The level of infestation in the two main Azorean towns differed, with high levels in the houses of Angra do Heroismo, whereas in Ponta Delgada, there are fewer houses with high levels of infestation. The infestation in Ponta Delgada shows a pattern of spreading from the center outward to the city's periphery, whereas in Angra do Heroismo, there was a pattern of spreading outward from several foci. The heavy infestation observed in Angra do Heroismo and the clear increase of infestation levels observed from 2010 to 2011 is a reason for concern and calls for an urgent application of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) control strategy.

AB  - Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) are among the most prolific and widespread urban pest species in the world. Yet despite their ubiquity, a unified understanding of the ecology of these species in urban habitats eludes us. A comprehensive understanding of urban rat ecology is important for managing rat populations and mitigating the harmful effects that they may have on urban ecosystems (e.g., structural damage, food contamination, and disease spread). The objective of this systematic review and narrative synthesis is to collate, compare, and contrast data from the published literature regarding the ecology of Norway and black rats in urban centers. Themes emerging from the synthesis process, and discussed in detail, include population dynamics, behavior, movement, and environmental influences on rat populations.

AB  - This research takes Wuhan as a case study with a focus on forest ecological network analysis based on an integrated approach. This approach applies the improved least-cost path model and scenario analysis to identify and compare networks with the cost surface setting, including ecological service value and biodiversity index. We proposed cost-based 5 index and patch connection index (PCI) to evaluate the whole network structure and ecological source connection, as these two indexes comprehensively consider spatial structure and species migration cost. This study proves that the improved line kernel density method based on species migration cost is an effective tool to identify conservation priority areas and break points. Based on the proposed method, we identify and evaluate four types of urban forest ecological networks from different cost setting. The forest ecological network is uneven in spatial distribution. Overall ecological network structure has poor connection. We illustrate conservation priority areas and divide these priority areas into three categories of ecological security.

AB  - Conservation officers have been neglected in policing studies literature due to a bias toward municipal and public police. The work of conservation officers and that of conventional public police overlap in ways that have not been explored. This article examines National Capital Commission (NCC) conservation officers' involvement in policing networks in Ottawa and, more specifically, NCC regulation of the Occupy movement in Canada's capital city. Having pitched tents in Ottawa's Confederation Park, Occupy participants fell under NCC jurisdictional authority. Contributing to emerging literature on policing of the Occupy movement and literature on policing networks, we analyse conservation officer occurrence reports on Occupy Ottawa obtained through federal level access to information requests and results of interviews with NCC officers. We demonstrate how NCC officers participate in campaigns for urban order, nuisance removal, and protest policing in a network including municipal and federal public police, private contract security, and federal intelligence agencies.

AB  - Habitat islands, corridors, and patches within the urban-rural mosaic provide important resources for migratory and resident species and may be crucial for breeding success and survival. In suburban areas, corridor width and patch size arc strongly correlated with community composition. We assessed the breeding bird community in the Historic Bethabara Park Complex (HBPC) by territory mapping during April-July 2009 and 2010. HBPC is a 77-ha habitat island in Winston-Salem (Forsyth County), NC. We detected 109 bird species in HBPC, including 60 for which we documented at least 1 breeding territory in either year. Each year we found territories of 58 species; 57 species were the same between years. The majority of birds encountered in this study nest in the canopy, in shrubs, or in cavities. The breeding community was roughly split between migrants (32) and residents (34) and included 3 exotic species. We documented territories for 10 woodland interior specialists including Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush), Seiurus aurocapilla (Ovenbird); and Piranga olivacea (Scarlet Tanager). Two of these observed bird species-Wood Thrush and Sala pusilla (Brown-headed Nuthatch)-are designated as US birds of conservation concern by Partners in Flight (PIF). Eight of the species we documented are considered by PIF to be species of conservation concern in the Piedmont Region during the breeding season and and 3 of these are common species in steep decline: Chaetura pelagica (Chimney Swift), Megaceryle alcyon (Belted Kingfisher), and Colaptes aura! us (Northern Flicker). HBPC is historically and currently species-rich and has a community composition similar to that seen in other NC Piedmont studies. We recommend periodic monitoring as the local landscape and climate change. Further research is needed to determine to what degree the park complex functions as an oasis or population sink for the bird community, especially for forest-interior obligates, Ncotropical migrants, and species of concern.

AB  - We model the occurrence of European wild rabbit in fragmented environments in a mountainous area of northwestern Spain (Gers-Xur,s Biosphere Reserve). We carried out a field survey by sampling the presence/absence of pellets in 237 plots (100 Au 100 m) selected at random below an altitude of 800 m. For modelling purposes, we considered eight predictors related to vegetation, topography, human influence and heterogeneity. We obtained vegetation and ecological predictors from land use/land cover maps derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images (acquired at the same time as the field data) and calculated vegetation indices by using a supervised classification method. We obtained topographical predictors from a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and used a generalized linear model to describe the occurrence of the European wild rabbit. The overall accuracy of the Landsat-derived map in Baixa Limia was 87.51 %, and the kappa coefficient was 0.85. The most parsimonious model included "grassland and crops", "mean slope", "distance to roads", "urban settlements" and "ecotone scrubland-forest". Five predictors were consequential, three of them with a positive sign for the presence of the species (scrub, urban settlements and ecotone scrubland-forest) and two with a negative sign (mean slope and distance to roads). The information on habitat requirements of European wild rabbit in the area provides a good framework for determining the habitat requirements of this keystone species in mountainous ecosystems in northwestern Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - 1. There is a growing concern that artificial light might affect local insect populations and disrupt their dispersal across the landscape. In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats.
   2. We set up six, c. 3.5m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11.
   3. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m(2) (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River.
   4. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers.

AB  - Understanding the flow of diaspores is fundamental for determining plant population dynamics in a particular habitat, and a lack of seeds is a limiting factor in forest regeneration, especially in isolated forest fragments. Bamboo dominance affects forest structure and dynamics by suppressing or delaying the recruitment of and colonization by tree species as well as by inhibiting the survival and growth of adult trees. The goal of the present study was to determine whether dominance of the bamboo species Aulonemia aristulata (Doll) McClure in the forest understory influences species abundance and composition. We examined the seed rain at two noncontiguous sites (1.5 km apart) within an urban forest fragment, with and without bamboo dominance (BD+ and BD- areas, respectively). Sixty seed traps (0.5 m(2), with a 1-mm mesh) were set in the BD+ and BD areas, and the seed rain was sampled from January to December 2007. Diaspores were classified according to dispersal syndrome, growth form and functional type of the species to which they belonged. There were significant differences between the two areas in terms of seed density, species diversity and dispersal syndrome. The BD+ area showed greater seed density and species diversity. In both areas, seed distribution was limited primarily by impaired dispersal. Bamboo dominance and low tree density resulted in fewer propagules in the seed rain. Our results suggest that low availability of seeds in the rain does not promote the maintenance of a degraded state, characterized by the presence of bamboo.

AB  - In Redland City, koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are in rapid decline as they are exposed to anthropogenic threats such as habitat clearing, dog attacks, vehicle collisions and disease. This study investigated the influence of linear infrastructure on the movement and habitat use of urban koalas. Seven koalas were tracked for up to 28 weeks during the breeding season. Home ranges were calculated for 95% Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP95%) and 95% fixed Kernel Density (FK95%). Koalas responded to the landscape in different ways. Linear infrastructure did not restrict the movements of most koalas. Home ranges varied from 1.1 to 31.5ha MCP95% and from 5 to 55ha for FK95%. Koalas mainly used Eucalyptus tereticornis throughout the study site. A variety of non-regionally endemic and regionally endemic trees in urban and remnant vegetation areas were used, suggesting that all trees are potentially koala habitat. At the completion of the study, four koalas remained alive, two were killed by trains and one died from a dog attack. Despite the small sample size and short duration, our results suggest that koalas are able to navigate linear infrastructure; however, the high rates of mortality associated with these movements puts the long-term viability of urban koala populations in doubt.

AB  - The scale of human movement at the local and regional levels in agrarian states, called 'local migration' by Charles Tilly, can be quite extensive. I review several characteristics of such movement, culled from a range of disciplines and historical contexts. Three spatial patterns are examined: village nucleation; rural-to-urban migration; and intra-urban movements. The movement of people into settlements - whether villages or cities - should not be viewed as an extraordinary occurrence requiring special explanation; instead, it is the normal concomitant of broader patterns of local and regional spatial mobility. The likelihood that individuals and households would move was determined largely by the effect of economic hardship at the household and local levels.

AB  - Cities are continuously evolving formations. Change occurs mostly incrementally, but sometimes more radical shifts transform the urban fabric. Considering the complexity of urban development processes, this paper asks for the conditions of collective action which enable an urban policy change deviating from established planning and political perceptions and interpretations, routines and actual balances of power. To capture the structuring conditions, the paper employs Emirbayer and Goodwin's theoretical approach (1996), which conceptualizes cultural, social-structural and social-psychological contexts of action. The paper translates their framework into a network-theoretical methodology which provides an analytical template for the exploration of two empirical case studies. The paper outlines a multilevel analysis and discusses the qualitative network reconstruction and a frame analysis. Interpreting the findings of the political implementation processes of two waterfront redevelopments, it can be assumed that strategic networks of interdependent but loosely coupled actors aspired to overcome hegemonic network domains. The analysis reveals two types of networks, which show an exclusive and an inclusive logic of action respectively. Apart from this general distinction, both cases indicate certain supportive conditions which helped to consolidate the new urban development schemes. Regarding the methodology, it can be concluded that the integrated analysis of actor configurations, cultural frames and social-psychological conditions allowed for an encompassing analysis and helped to discern a variety of constraining and enabling conditions on human agency in urban politics.

AB  - A variety of environmental processes, including topography, edaphic and disturbance factors can influence vegetation composition. The relative influence of these patterns has been known to vary with scale, however, few studies have focused on environmental drivers of composition at the mesoscale. This study examined the relative importance of topography, catchment flow and soil in influencing tree assemblages in Karawatha Forest Park; a South-East Queensland subtropical eucalypt forest embedded in an urban matrix that is part of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network South-East Queensland Peri-urban SuperSite. Thirty-three LTER plots were surveyed at the mesoscale (909 ha), where all woody stems >= 1.3 m high rooted within plots were sampled. Vegetation was divided into three cohorts: small (>= 1-10 cm DBH), intermediate (>= 10-30 cm DBH), and large (>= 30 cm DBH). Plot slope, aspect, elevation, catchment area and location and soil chemistry and structure were also measured. Ordinations and smooth surface modelling were used to determine drivers of vegetation assemblage in each cohort. Vegetation composition was highly variable among plots at the mesoscale (plots systematically placed at 500 m intervals). Elevation was strongly related to woody vegetation composition across all cohorts (R-2: 0.69-0.75). Other topographic variables that explained a substantial amount of variation in composition were catchment area (R-2: 0.43-0.45) and slope (R-2: 0.23-0.61). Soil chemistry (R-2: 0.09-0.75) was also associated with woody vegetation composition. While species composition differed substantially between cohorts, the environmental variables explaining composition did not. These results demonstrate the overriding importance of elevation and other topographic features in discriminating tree assemblage patterns irrespective of tree size. The importance of soil characteristics to tree assemblages was also influenced by topography, where ridge top sites were typically drier and had lower soil nutrient levels than riparian areas.

AB  - This paper aims at getting a quantitative and qualitative characterization of land use in an area of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MASP), more precisely the city of Taboao da Serra (SP). We explain that land use has physical and social characteristics in an intraurban context, as it is demonstrated mainly by the evolution of the forms and the type of use and occupancy given to the landscape. The choice of the city was given by its physical characteristics, the dense urban network and its population density. We compare two years of urban occupation (1962 and 2007), by using aerial photographs and subsequently elaborated, by means of modules of ArcInfo 9.3 software, numerical models (DEM), in order to view the occupation, land use and local geoecological conditions through the quantitative and qualitative evaluation, which can be interpreted from the resulting maps.

AB  - Urbanization represents the most extreme form of land cover transformation and is expected to restrict dispersal of animals, both because of the structural unsuitability of the novel habitat, as well as through mechanisms associated with human activity, such as disturbance. Fragmentation of populations by urbanization is considered to be a significant threat to several endangered bird populations, although isolation has seldom been demonstrated genetically. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of genetic criteria for identifying at-risk populations, using a salt-marsh-inhabiting bird, the white-fronted chat Epthianura albifrons, as a case study. DNA was extracted from feathers from 78 individuals from five sites, including two salt marsh remnants situated within the intensively urbanized zone of a city of more than three million people, and three sites up to 500 km distant. Microsatellite markers were used to measure genetic diversity and compare genetic structure between populations. Analyses of population structure demonstrated that the two populations surrounded by intensive urban development were genetically distinct from each other despite being separated by less than 20 km. They were also distinct from larger populations beyond the urban zone that showed much lower levels of genetic differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance, despite being separated by continuous forest, which is not a recognized habitat for this species. The two endangered populations had low levels of genetic diversity reflected in the number of alleles and heterozygosity. Two immigrants were detected in one of the isolated populations, but their reproductive success was very low and they failed to effect genetic rescue. This study demonstrates that the endangered population satisfies the genetic criteria for listing, and although the population is unlikely to have special evolutionary significance in itself, flagging the population highlights the vulnerability of some coastal fauna to the impacts of urbanization.

AB  - Land-use mapping is critical for global change research. In Central Arizona, U. S. A., the spatial distribution of land use is important for sustainable land management decisions. The objective of this study was to create a land-use map that serves as a model for the city of Maricopa, an expanding urban region in the Sun Corridor of Arizona. We use object-based image analysis to map six land-use types from ASTER imagery, and then compare this with two per-pixel classifications. Our results show that a single segmentation, combined with intermediary classifications and merging, morphing, and growing image-objects, can lead to an accurate land-use map that is capable of utilizing both spatial and spectral information. We also employ a moving-window diversity assessment to help with analysis and improve post-classification modifications.

AB  - Dispersal is a fundamental process in ecology influencing the genetic structure and the viability of populations. Understanding how variable factors influence the dispersal of the population is becoming an important question in animal ecology. To date, geographic distance and geographic barriers are often considered as main factors impacting dispersal, but their effects are variable depending on different conditions. In general, geographic barriers affect more significantly than geographic distance on dispersal. In rapidly expanding populations, however, geographic barriers have less effect on dispersal than geographic distance. The effects of both geographic distance and geographic barriers in low-density populations with patchy distributions are poorly understood. By using a panel of 10 microsatellite loci we investigated the genetic structure of three patchy-distributed populations of the Greater long-tailed hamster (Tscherskia triton) from Raoyang, Guan and Shunyi counties of the North China Plain. The results showed that (i) high genetic diversity and differentiation exist in three geographic populations with patchy distributions; (ii) gene flow occurs among these three populations with physical barriers of Beijing city and Hutuo River, which potentially restricted the dispersal of the animal; (iii) the gene flow is negatively correlated with the geographic distance, while the genetic distance shows the positive correlation. Our results suggest that the effect of the physical barriers is conditional-dependent, including barrier capacity or individual potentially dispersal ability. Geographic distance also acts as an important factor affecting dispersal for the patchy distributed geographic populations. So, gene flow is effective, even at relatively long distances, in balancing the effect of geographic barrier in this study.

AB  - The Detroit River and western Lake Erie, located in the heart of the Great Lakes basin, support a great diversity of fish and wildlife, and their habitats, despite the enormity of habitat losses due to urban development and industrialization. This ecosystem also links Canada and the U.S. who share a long history of cooperative conservation. The river and lake are: at the intersection of two major North American bird migration flyways (i.e., the Atlantic and Mississippi); a significant fish migration corridor; and well recognized for their unique biodiversity. Over the past three decades much has been done to improve environmental conditions and to restore and conserve habitats. This paper reviews habitat management efforts within the environs of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and provides advice to improve such efforts in the future. Ecological improvements resulting from these habitat projects, as well as the cumulative effects of these changes, have yet to be quantified or evaluated against existing program goals or targets. Habitat management remains a fragmented responsibility among many agencies and interests, which is often an obstacle to realizing ecological improvements, recovery, and sustainability. Moreover, cumulative habitat modifications are not reviewed often enough with respect to their impacts on the goals and targets established in existing programs, as well as their impacts on ecosystem results (e.g., fish or wildlife productivity). Clearly, there is a need to share experiences, synthesize science, learn from mistakes and successes, coordinate activities, and transfer knowledge on best practices and ecological effectiveness of habitat management.

AB  - Modern cities represent one of the fastest growing ecosystems on the planet. Urbanization occurs in stages; each stage characterized by a distinct habitat that may be more or less susceptible to the establishment of disease vector populations and the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. We performed longitudinal entomological and epidemiological surveys in households along a 1900 x 125 m transect of Arequipa, Peru, a major city of nearly one million inhabitants, in which the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, by the insect vector Triatoma infestans, is an ongoing problem. The transect spans a cline of urban development from established communities to land invasions. We find that the vector is tracking the development of the city, and the parasite, in turn, is tracking the dispersal of the vector. New urbanizations are free of vector infestation for decades. T. cruzi transmission is very recent and concentrated in more established communities. The increase in land tenure security during the course of urbanization, if not accompanied by reasonable and enforceable zoning codes, initiates an influx of construction materials, people and animals that creates fertile conditions for epidemics of some vector-borne diseases.

AB  - This article reconstructs the reality of urban social movements of the homeless in Rio de Janeiro in the early twenty-first century through empirical research referred to the observation and the interviews with the occupants of abandoned public buildings in the central area of the city. From the methodological point of view, the theoretical reconstruction of empirical reality is grounded in the theoretical and methodological tools and research techniques used in the field work in accordance with ethnographic and ethnomethodological approach by Harold Garfinkel. From the theoretical point of view, this work assumes the hypothesis according to which the condition for knowing the law requires the dialectical relationship building that articulates the right as a product and the right as a process. Based on Marxist thought, this dialectical relationship operates with the category "citizenship" as a dimension of the reality that is central in the conception of the homeless movement as a tool for the production of the right to housing in urban areas.

AB  - The biodiversity of aquatic inland habitats currently faces unprecedented threats from human activities. At the same time, although much is known about the functioning of freshwater ecosystems the successful transfer of such knowledge to practical conservation has not been universal. This alarming situation is considered here using a theme of the conservation of freshwater fishes, supported where appropriate with examples drawn from other taxa. Global awareness of aquatic conservation issues is also hampered by conditions under the water surface being largely hidden from the direct experience of most members of society. Connectivity, or lack of it, is another challenge to the conservation of freshwater habitats, while urban areas can play a perhaps unexpectedly important positive role. Freshwater habitats frequently enjoy benefits accruing from a sense of ownership or stewardship by local inhabitants, which has led to the development of conservation movements which commonly started life centred on the habitat itself but of which many have now matured into wider catchment-based conservation programmes. A demonstrable need for evidence-based conservation management in turn requires scientific assessments to be increasingly robust and standardised, while at the same time remaining open to the adoption of technological advances and welcoming the rapidly developing citizen science movement. There is evidence of real progress in this context and conservation scientists are now communicating their findings to environmental managers in a way and on a scale that was rarely seen a couple of decades ago. It is only in this way that scientific knowledge can be efficiently transferred to conservation planning, prioritisation and ultimately management in an increasingly scaled-up, joined-up and resource-limited world. The principle of 'prevention is better than cure' is particularly appropriate to most biological conservation issues in aquatic inland habitats and is inextricably linked to educating and/or nudging appropriate human behaviours. When prevention fails, some form of emergency rescue such as captive breeding or translocations may be justified for particularly important animal or plant populations. However, long-haul missions of habitat rehabilitation or restoration are generally to be preferred even if they may take decades to reach fruition. Conservation researchers, managers and practitioners must be realistic in their objectives and timescales for such programmes and take positive steps to communicate such information to stakeholders. Now more than ever, people are interested in conservation and sustainability. There are substantial challenges ahead, but these are better days for the biological conservation of aquatic inland habitats.

AB  - Changes to the ground layer in urban areas are extensive, but the effects on arthropod fauna are poorly understood. We undertook a manipulative experiment to examine the response of arthropods to small-scale variation in ground covers commonly found in urban parks and gardens in Australia. The ground covers tested were bare ground, leaf litter, woodchips and grass, with plot sizes of 3.6 m(2). Epigeic arthropods were sampled with pitfall traps and Tullgren funnels over 12 months following establishment of the treatments. All epigeic arthropods were sorted to order and the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), beetles (Coleoptera), millipedes (Diplopoda) and slaters (Isopoda: Oniscidea) were examined at lower taxonomic levels. Diverse arthropods rapidly colonised previously cleared plots in all four treatments and were most abundant in grass plots. The diversity of ants and beetles was significantly different in different ground covers and tended to be most diverse in grass plots. Despite the treatments providing very different microclimates, the fauna studied did not show strong selection for a particular cover type overall. The abundance of grass cover in the surrounding area may have led to the grass plots having the greatest abundance of arthropods. These results have important implications for developing effective small-scale conservation efforts for arthropods in anthropogenically modified landscapes, especially for species with poor dispersal abilities.

AB  - The methodology presented here is grounded on the reconstruction of the urban body as a network configuration consisting of material and non-material components (Bateson, 1972). It is based on the assumption that if one can describe the rules that define the nodes and the connections of the network construction/urban body, as well as their attributes, then the differentiation on the relationships between elements, or even a shift from one value to another, would result in different network constructions, that would produce a time-based sequence of the self-adaptational and self-organizational reconfigurations occurring during the mutational procedure. The urban body is defined as the part of the urban tissue which distinguishes itself from the whole of the urban landscape, either because of constructed boundaries, or because of the strengthening of a specific attribute, which would result in a kind of an immaterial boundary, or, in other words the formation of an identity.

AB  - This article investigates the spatial distribution of global solar radiation (K down arrow) in Torun and its suburbs, observed in 2012. Measurements were taken at 12 points (7 within the city and 5 in the suburban area) using CNR4 net radiometers and automatic weather stations (Vantage Pro+). At all locations, the diurnal and annual courses of K down arrow were typically related to the Earth's rotational movement and changes in the sun's declination over the year, and disturbed by clouds and atmospheric phenomena that enhance the extinction of solar radiation. A substantial spatial diversity of K down arrow was observed in Torun and its suburbs. The annual sum of K down arrow at several urban locations accounted for over 70% of the solar radiation in the open space outside the city. The amount of incoming solar radiation in the urban area was more restricted in winter (< 50%) than in summer (approx. 70%). The diurnal courses of K down arrow were heavily disturbed by local obstacles which cast shadows (causing a considerable decrease of K down arrow), but there were instances of increases in K down arrow (122%) augmented by radiation reflected from roofs, walls and windows surrounding the measurement point. The spatial diversity of K down arrow in the urban area is heterogeneous, due to local meteorological conditions (cloudiness, fog, smog and airborne dust) and the obscuring of the horizon.

AB  - In the United States, interest in urban agriculture has grown dramatically. While community gardens have sprouted across the landscape, home food gardens-arguably an ever-present, more durable form of urban agriculture-have been overlooked, understudied, and unsupported by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academics. In part a response to the invisibility of home gardens, this paper is a manifesto for their study in the Global North. It seeks to develop a multi-scalar and multidisciplinary research framework that acknowledges the garden's social and ecological or material dimensions. Given the lack of existing research, we draw on the more extensive literature on home gardens in the South and community gardens in the North to develop a set of hypotheses about the social-ecological effects of urban home food gardens in the North. These gardens, we hypothesize, contribute to food security, community development, cultural reproduction, and resilience at multiple scales; conserve agrobiodiversity; and support urban biodiversity. They may also have negative ecological effects, such as stormwater nutrient loading. Because of the entanglement of the social and the ecological or material in the garden, we review three theoretical perspectives-social ecological systems theory, actor-network theory, and assemblage theory-that have been or could be applied to the multi-scalar and multidisciplinary study of the garden. We also review sampling and analytic methods for conducting home garden research. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities to extend the research agenda beyond descriptive analysis, the primary focus of garden research to date.

KW  - street network as structural public symbolic system
KW  - gender based power distribution
KW  - the street names in Belgrade by female names
AB  - The street city network and the street names represent structural public symbolic system which is characterized by readability. This readability gives identity; the city is clearly divided in significant and less significant zones used for different purposes with different levels of communicativity. It is explicitly connected with public memory evocation- with collective memory and the state ideology. Having that in mind, the names of streets in Belgrade given by female names will be analyzed. It is analyzed how it is in structural manner the street network in Belgrade on symbolic level (through the names of streets and their distribution in the street network structure) expresses gender based distribution of power in the public spaceusing relation between the center and periphery in certain municipalities and the city as a whole. Investigating different city zones, it can be showed "rationalization of political domination" - the parts of the city where the residencies of foreign countries, embassies and consulates are situated, representative and private, as well as zones which belong to different social stratums - higher and lower layers, which are also the zones of different communicative capacity (determinated by the structure of street network). This analysis clearly points out on distinctive, even though implicitly inherited difference in power distribution and gender based standings in social organization of the space. Streets which got the name by women are very few and they occupy marginal positions in the street network structure - they are mostly peripheral, smaller streets, which are in high percent dead end streets. In the same time, the dynamics of the change of the street names in the last decade is not in favor of the names from National Liberation Army (NOB). Street name change affirms historical females characters from XIX century, expressing on the direct way the ideological change and the need of classes and stratums which tend to establish their social position today and their influence on the changing the view on history in order to consolidate their own legitimization.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the major forms of habitat alteration occurring at the present time. Although this is typically deleterious to biodiversity, some species flourish within these human-modified landscapes, potentially leading to negative and/or positive interactions between people and wildlife. Hence, up-to-date assessment of urban wildlife populations is important for developing appropriate management strategies. Surveying urban wildlife is limited by land partition and private ownership, rendering many common survey techniques difficult. Garnering public involvement is one solution, but this method is constrained by the inherent biases of non-standardised survey effort associated with voluntary participation. We used a television-led media approach to solicit national participation in an online sightings survey to investigate changes in the distribution of urban foxes in Great Britain and to explore relationships between urban features and fox occurrence and sightings density. Our results show that media-based approaches can generate a large national database on the current distribution of a recognisable species. Fox distribution in England and Wales has changed markedly within the last 25 years, with sightings submitted from 91% of urban areas previously predicted to support few or no foxes. Data were highly skewed with 90% of urban areas having >30 fox sightings per 1000 people km(-2). The extent of total urban area was the only variable with a significant impact on both fox occurrence and sightings density in urban areas; longitude and percentage of public green urban space were respectively, significantly positively and negatively associated with sightings density only. Latitude, and distance to nearest neighbouring conurbation had no impact on either occurrence or sightings density. Given the limitations associated with this method, further investigations are needed to determine the association between sightings density and actual fox density, and variability of fox density within and between urban areas in Britain.

AB  - This article is a descriptive mapping of the Costa Rican capital, San Jose. I discuss the different ecologies of men's fashion as produced by the city, emphasizing how the physical landscape of the city informs, and perhaps defines, the sartorial choices of the men that inhabit it. The resulting range of performed masculinities reflects the relationships established between men and their near environment, primarily their clothes and the spaces they occupy in San Jose. I also look at spaces that provide interconnections between different masculinities and spaces that are points of crossover from one network to another. This mapping presents information about the connection between masculinities, fashion, and space for Costa Rican men as it highlights the layering that results from important differences in age, social class, power, privilege, taste, and other parameters. The article describes a variety of environments, including the casual and bohemian styles at the Universidad de Costa Rica, clothing at working-class hangouts such as the Mercado Central, and the urban decay in the red-light district. I discuss shopping options ranging from the old department stores in Avenida Central catering to the middle classes to the state-of-the-art shopping centers in upper-class areas. The range of fashion and masculinities goes from sports clothing and team paraphernalia to the well-off urban dandies who proudly display perfectly fitted and ironed clothes. The complicated kaleidoscope of masculinities includes groups such as surfers, skaters, out-of-place tourists, and native Costa Ricans who have abandoned the reservation in search for a better life in the capital. The landscape of fashioned masculinities in San Jose is one of an urban hybrid postmodern city where cultural and social memory is present in dress, but modernization and globalization open routes for continuous innovation and experimentation with fashion.

AB  - The plant trade provides a major mechanism for the long-distance dispersal of land snails, including slugs, which have low natural mobility. Whereas inspections at national borders intercept many in-coming snails, dispersal within countries is much less well regulated and documented. To investigate the role of plant nurseries as a source for the distribution of non-native invertebrates, particularly land snails, we surveyed snails in 28 nurseries in Oklahoma (United States) and compared our survey with similar surveys worldwide. We found 36 taxa, including 16 species not native to the region; 11 of these were new state records. Snail species richness increased with increasing outside area of snail-appropriate habitat, but not with enclosed greenhouse area. Species composition was similar among nurseries and Oklahoma nurseries shared several species with nurseries in Hawaii and Europe. Appropriate models for the dispersal of snails via plant nurseries are the transport hub model (snails moving as contaminants on plants coming into and leaving nurseries) and, for snail populations already established in nurseries, the stratified diffusion model (contamination of plants by snails within nurseries, followed by long-distance jumps as plants are sold and transported). Potted plants are portable habitats that protect snails from detection, pesticides and desiccation. Dispersing snails may survive in urban habitats, where mulching and watering may ameliorate hot, dry summers and cold winters.

AB  - Global population growth and associated urban development are having profound effects on biodiversity. Two major outcomes of expanding development that affect wildlife are light and noise pollution. In this paper, we review literature reporting the effects of light and noise on biodiversity, and assess implications for conservation planning in Australia. Our results clearly indicate that light and noise pollution have the potential to affect the physiology, behaviour and reproduction of a range of animal taxa. Types of effects include changes in foraging and reproductive behaviours, reduction in animal fitness, increased risk of predation and reduced reproductive success. These could have flow-on consequences at the population and ecosystem levels. We found a significant gap in knowledge of the impact of these pollutants on Australian fauna. To reduce the effect of light and noise pollution, there needs to be careful planning of urban areas in relation to protected areas, and for biodiversity more generally. Potential measures include strategically planning the types of development and associated human activities adjacent to protected areas, and the use of shields and barriers, such as covers for lights or the use of dense native vegetation screens, while still allowing movement of animals. Changes in government standards and regulations could also help to reduce the impacts of light and noise pollution.

AB  - Compared with the correlation of housing price fluctuations among the major cities, the link on geography and economy is closer between the provincial cities, and the movement of capital and population is more common. These features make the correlation of price fluctuations is more likely to occur. This paper utilizes Granger causality test to investigate the housing price interactions among the cities in Shaanxi province by employing the housing price data from 1999 to 2011. The research shows that the inverted conductive relationship which the surrounding cities promote the central city exists in the housing price of Shaanxi. On this basis, this paper quantifies the degree of the correlation by using the impulse response function method. The conclusion will enlighten the establishment of the intervention and coordination mechanism.

AB  - The Occupy movement catalyzed public debate on the issue of growing income inequality. This paper examines recent patterns of inequality in Canada, paying particular attention to changes in the characteristics of the top 1% of income earners. At the national level, the gap between the top percentile and the other 99% has widened considerably: in 2006, 11% of the nation's income was concentrated in the hands of top earners (whose mean income of $344,000 is 11 times that of the average Canadian) compared with 7.7% just 15 years earlier. Beneath such national-level figures lie important geographical differences in the income hierarchy: the thresholds, average incomes and socio-economic characteristics of the top 1% vary widely across provinces and cities. Among the most important spatial shifts observed is the growing concentration of high-income groups in energy-rich Western Canada, where Calgary has become the most unequal city in the country.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of the landscape are the main causes of the decline and the extinction of many wildlife species. In this study we test the impact of landscape features on the genetic connectivity of a sedentary bird. Populations of our case study, the grey partridge (Perdix perdix armoricana), occur in central northern France. This is considered as the last bastion of high grey partridge densities in Europe and thus represents a relevant zone for the conservation of P. p. armoricana. Despite a highly man dominated landscape, results from the analysis of 12 microsatellite genotypes suggest the beginning of a genetic structure. This emerging genetic structure can result from the last historical event having occurred in the study area: a massive urbanization since the nineteenth century following the increase of the human density and town surface. Another hypothesis suggests that the weak genetic structure can result from a massive restocking with captive-bred individuals at a more or less recent point in time.

AB  - Whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. In highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. However, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. Here, we investigated a European red squirrel population located in an urban park close to Paris, France (Parc de Sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. Using mitochondrial D-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. The size of the population was estimated at 100-120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, Distance Sampling and Capture-Mark-Recapture. The estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a Population Viability Analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. Results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). This study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western European countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained.

AB  - Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect, consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes, then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods. In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river. These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river restoration and management efforts.

AB  - Like in all Brazilians touristic towns, the main attraction is the urban center with the touristic activities and its history. As peculiarity, this city has many events throughout the year which attract considerable amount of tourists and consequently a large number of cars, occurring conflicts in the street's circulation. This floating population during these events is almost three times bigger than the regular one and change the urban life.
   In the diagiostic stage, the Mobility Plan analyzed socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, traffic and transport aspects, through information received and collected in the field. The diapiostic addressed the deficiencies and potentialities of this city, which have been translated into maps and illustrative images with the support of GIS software such as ArcGIS.
   From the diaiosis, a need was identified to analyze two different and specific situations in the city: 1) time of events and weekends, 2) the daily routine of the population, from Monday to Friday. From this emerged the overall objective: to study the circulation of this city and its historical center, allowing the free movement of pedestrians in the historic center, by restricting access of motorized vehicles on a pre-defined perimeter in those crucial moments. Seeking to assist this premise and considering the information collected and analyzed, interventions have been proposed to solve the problems raised. The result of the diagtostic and the proposals were presented at public hearings with community participation in making decisions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing fragmentation of grassland habitats by human activities is a major threat to biodiversity and landscape quality. Monitoring their degree of fragmentation has been identified as an urgent need. This study quantifies for the first time the current degree of grassland fragmentation in the Canadian Prairies using four fragmentation geometries (FGs) of increasing specificity (i.e. more restrictive grassland classification) and five types of reporting units (7 ecoregions, 50 census divisions, 1,166 municipalities, 17 sub-basins, and 108 watersheds). We evaluated the suitability of 11 datasets based on 8 suitability criteria and applied the effective mesh size (m (eff)) method to quantify fragmentation. We recommend the combination of the Crop Inventory Mapping of the Prairies and the CanVec datasets as the most suitable for monitoring grassland fragmentation. The grassland area remaining amounts to 87,570.45 km(2) in FG4 (strict grassland definition) and 183,242.042 km(2) in FG1 (broad grassland definition), out of 461,503.97 km(2) (entire Prairie Ecozone area). The very low values of m (eff) of 14.23 km(2) in FG4 and 25.44 km(2) in FG1 indicate an extremely high level of grassland fragmentation. The m (eff) method is supported in this study as highly suitable and recommended for long-term monitoring of grasslands in the Canadian Prairies; it can help set measurable targets and/or limits for regions to guide management efforts and as a tool for performance review of protection efforts, for increasing awareness, and for guiding efforts to minimize grassland fragmentation. This approach can also be applied in other parts of the world and to other ecosystems.

AB  - Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) data can be used to identify larval mosquito habitats and predict species distribution and abundance across a landscape. An understanding of the landscape features that impact abundance and dispersal can then be applied operationally in mosquito control efforts to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. In an effort to better understand the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the abundance of the West Nile virus (WNV) vector Culex tarsalis, we determined associations between GIS-based environmental data at multiple spatial extents and monthly abundance of adult Cx. tarsalis in Larimer County and Weld County, CO. Mosquito data were collected from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps operated as part of local WNV surveillance efforts. Multiple regression models were developed for prediction of monthly Cx. tarsalis abundance for June, July, and August using 4 years of data collected over 2007-10. The models explained monthly adult mosquito abundance with accuracies ranging from 51-61% in Fort Collins and 57-88% in Loveland-Johnstown. Models derived using landscape-level predictors indicated that adult Cx. tarsalis abundance is negatively correlated with elevation. In this case, low-elevation areas likely more abundantly include habitats for Cx. tarsalis. Model output indicated that the perimeter of larval sites is a significant predictor of Cx. tarsalis abundance at a spatial extent of 500 m in Loveland-Johnstown in all months examined. The contribution of irrigated crops at a spatial extent of 500 m improved model fit in August in both Fort Collins and Loveland-Johnstown. These results emphasize the significance of irrigation and the manual control of water across the landscape to provide viable larval habitats for Cx. tarsalis in the study area. Results from multiple regression models can be applied operationally to identify areas of larval Cx. tarsalis production (irrigated crops lands and standing water) and assign priority in larval treatments to areas with a high density of larval sites at relevant spatial extents around urban locations.

AB  - The research deals with the theme of the reclamation of a territory rich in memories of the past and in important traces of its country and settlement's culture, today overall largely degraded.
   The study area is the plain of the Sarno river, on south of Vesuvius Mount, between the slopes of the volcano, the Picentini mountains and the sea coast, with the river as central axis.
   It's just an area full of historical memories: Pompei stood there with its harbour on the river, Stabiae and Nuceria, and there are the remains of several centuriatio that left the marks on which the territory was built. Since ancient times it was been crossed by major communication routes between north and south. The Sarno river, with its central axis and an extensive network of tributaries and canals, was the principal resource of the area, due to the abundance of water and to the rich volcanic soil, and it has always been a land of specialized crops and of manufacturing production. Even today it's an important agricultural area, and a landscape of interest.
   But now the plain, especially towards the sea, is a territory invaded by an uncontrolled urbanization, with high density zones of poor-quality buildings, who have paid some cities between them. And the carelessness made the river the first cause of the ecological disaster of this area (with waste, industrial and food poisons): a typical urban territory sprawled and polluted.
   So we think an important design issue is thinking of the Sarno River as the soul, the element that still can restore the lost area identity. So (after the rehabilitation already begun) it will be possible to redevelop the relationships between urban areas, rebuilding their hierarchies, and restore the character of agricultural areas and the existing typical nature, by protecting and enhancing them

AB  - The urbanization process affects faunal distributions and movement patterns, contributing directly to biotic homogenization and representing an important threat to biodiversity. In particular, birds, which have been well studied as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, are especially valuable in evaluating these impacts.
   While the negative impact of these processes and structures, most notably road and railway networks, are now well appreciated (e.g. habitat loss, disturbance, noise, mortality by collisions, barrier effects), the potentially positive effects on wildlife are less appreciated (the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5). Here, were reviewed a total of 92 peer-reviewed publications for the period of 36 years between 1978 and 2014, which reported positive effects of roads and associated anthropogenic structures on birds. Our results show that roads, railways and several associated constructions, commonly implicated in the decline of biodiversity, may also have positive effects on certain bird species or communities. The main types of positive effects on birds identified were classified as: (1) roads: providing foraging habitat; reducing the predation pressures; and providing a warm surface assists in conserving metabolic energy; (2) lights of streets: prolonging diurnal activity; (3) powerlines, fences, etc. along roads: providing perches for hunting activities; and (4) bridges, pylons, tree lines along roadsides, bases of powerline pylons: providing nesting sites and cover from predators. From this review, we provide a useful tool for ecologists, road planners and other stakeholders engaged on conservation or landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To facilitate urban planning and management in fast-growing metropolitan areas, it is highly necessary to detect the spatiotemporal changes of different land cover types. This study aimed at identifying Beijing's land cover types and detecting the characteristics of their spatiotemporal changes using time series remote sensing and GIS techniques from 1978 to 2010. A total of 16 Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images were collected during the spring and late summer seasons. After preprocessing the dataset, artificial neural network was used to perform the land cover classification. Consequently, four maps were generated for 1978, 1992, 2000, and 2010, with six classes (agriculture, woodland, grassland, water, urban, and barren land) according to the level I classification scheme. Three transition matrices were constructed to represent all possible changes that occur in the landscape. The results showed that agriculture, barren land, and grassland had an increase in area, while urban, water, and woodland had a reduction within the study area. A total of 2,032.341 km(2) agriculture was reduced and 2,359.146 km(2) woodland was increased. In the three periods for 1978-1992, 1992-2000, 2000-2010, agriculture had the largest amount of transfer out primarily to urban class around central urban areas and woodland had the most transfer in mainly from barren land in mountainous areas. More importantly, the driving forces analysis including economic development, growth of population and construction areas, and institutional policies was conducted to find out the primary factors inducing the land cover change.

AB  - Large carnivores can be particularly sensitive to the effects of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity [1, 2]. The Santa Monica Mountains (SMMs), a large natural area within Greater Los Angeles, is completely isolated by urban development and the 101 freeway to the north. Yet the SMMs support a population of mountain lions (Puma concolor), a very rare example of a large carnivore persisting within the boundaries of a megacity. GPS locations of radio-collared lions indicate that freeways are a near-absolute barrier to movement. We genotyped 42 lions using 54 microsatellite loci and found that genetic diversity in SMM lions, prior to 2009, was lower than that for any population in North America except in southern Florida, where inbreeding depression led to reproductive failure [3-5]. We document multiple instances of father-daughter inbreeding and high levels of intraspecific strife, including the unexpected behavior of a male killing two of his offspring and a mate and his son killing two of his brothers. Overall, no individuals from the SMMs have successfully dispersed. Gene flow is critical for this population, and we show that a single male immigrated in 2009, successfully mated, and substantially enhanced genetic diversity. Our results imply that individual behaviors, most likely caused by limited area and reduced opportunities to disperse, may dominate the fate of small, isolated populations of large carnivores. Consequently, comprehensive behavioral monitoring can suggest novel solutions for the persistence of small populations, such as the transfer of individuals across dispersal barriers.

AB  - Today's urban green space is exposed to a constant flow of newly introduced exotic plant species, resulting from multiple, intentional and inadvertent introductions. A substantial share of introduced plant species are represented by potential invaders of plant communities, which allows considering that the risk of rapid dispersion by aggressive plant species to be today's most serious threat to the urban biodiversity. Alien plant species with a short life span (monocarps, therophytes, annuals and biennials) are the most successful invaders across anthropogenically transformed landscapes. These species can have a significant impact on the functioning of previously disturbed ecosystems. At the same time, it is still unclear which mechanisms enable short-lived monocarps to invade under specific conditions of urban forest interiors. Therefore, I have conducted a literature analysis aiming at identifying possible biological and ecological determinants of monocarpic plants' invasive success in urban woodlands. The analysis was made at three qualitative levels taking into account characteristics of the urban environment, those of different types of urban woodlands as well as traits of non-native monocarpic species. Considering the city level, the main ecological factors are the high level of human-induced disturbance and propagule pressure on the urban-woodland interface sites. The level of invasion as well as invasibility of urban woodlands is mainly determined by the landscape context, whereas the habitat type, species composition and spatial structure play a less important role. In the forest environment, where competition for light and nutrients is the main shaping factor of the phytocoenosis, short-lived alien species must possess a certain level of competitive ability. These findings indicate that this ability may be due to such traits as high fecundity rates, effective dispersal mechanisms, early germination, high rate of growth and the overall big size of plants, presence of autonomous pollination and high shade-tolerance.

AB  - Over the past decade, an increasing share of refugees and other types of humanitarian migrants have settled in regional Australia either of their own accord or through the government's refugee settlement programme. This follows a trend in other Western countries that have implemented dispersal policies to direct humanitarian migrants to regional towns on the grounds of burden sharing and regional development. At the same time, migrants themselves are increasingly targeting rural destinations that promise easier access to employment and a quieter life than large cosmopolitan cities offer. This paper explores the experience of settling refugees in regional Australia through a case study which shows that ethnic communities are vital to sustaining refugee settlement in regional towns. These communities help ameliorate some of the drawbacks of regional towns, such as limited, specialised services and scarce opportunities for social and economic advancement and foster their sociocultural transformation. While openness to cultural diversity plays an important role in regional towns' ability to retain humanitarian migrants, this alone cannot compensate for a lack of opportunities for socio-economic advancement.

AB  - Assessing the causes of stream impairments is challenging without a clear understanding of the spatiotemporal interactions among human infrastructure networks and hydrologic systems. Landscape change is often characterized using simplistic metrics that lump changes into generalized categories, such as impervious cover. We examined the evolution of human infrastructure in Panther Hollow, a small watershed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to characterize the impacts of long-term (similar to 100 years) landscape change on stream flow. Results show that impervious cover in the catchment grew from 3 % in 1900 to 27 % in 2010. Growth was non-linear, with 60 % of the development occurring between 1904 and 1930. We then compared two models that predict changes in annual water yield, one model based on watershed impervious cover and one based on human infrastructure arrangement. The model based solely on impervious cover predicts excessive amounts of surface runoff relative to the infrastructure model and monitored yield. This discrepancy occurs because the impervious model does not account for the diversion of 50 % of the watershed drainage through the combined sewer system to an adjacent basin. In the Panther Hollow watershed, hydrology is dominated by a reduction in water yield, contrasting typical hydrologic changes associated with urbanization. Our analysis reveals the value of quantifying additional landscape metrics, such as infrastructure pattern and connectivity, which provide a more complete understanding of how human development alters natural hydrology.

AB  - Hong Kong's rugged topography demands creation of developable land by reclaiming the harbor and terracing hillslopes. The vertical faces between adjoining hillslope-platforms are often stabilized by stone retaining walls. Such artificial cliffs embedded in the urban matrix, as a habitat analogue of rocky cliffs, have been colonized by spontaneous-ruderal vegetation. Detailed field assessment of 289 walls with 793 trees permitted in-depth analysis of this unique tropical urban ecology to inform conservation. The 28 stonewall tree species, mainly native, are dominated by six keystone and companion Ficus (Moraceae) species. They can develop into large cliff hangers > 20 m height on the apparently precarious and inhospitable walls. The many joints between masonry blocks provide opportunities for lodging and germination of seeds brought by frugivorous birds and bats. The aft-soil behind walls provides catchment for normal root functions. Beginning as pioneers and persisting as climax members, they short-circuit the seral processes. Wall-gripping capability as large epilithic woody hemi-epiphytes is due to the strangler-fig habit, an evolutionary trait that originated in the tropical forest. The polymorphic roots with morphological plasticity and self-grafting ability, and their multiple modes of interactions with wall niches, account for firm attachment on the vertical habitat and exploration of proximal soils. A model of strangler-fig growth on stone walls serving as surrogate host tree is developed. The diverse and versatile rooting modes are the basis to sustain strangler-fig wall conditions to permit continuation of strangler-fig habit. Such unique nature-in-city and natural-cum-cultural gems deserve conservation as urban ecological heritage.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the floristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

AB  - The movement #YoSoy132 in Mexico began in May 2012. It represented an uncontainable social eruption, a self-generated call to action which took to the streets and squares of the country's main towns and cities. This article seeks to highlight the specific nature of these protests by examining the collective action and the experience of the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). As an activist network, #YoSoy132 developed within a cycle of protests that simultaneously create << common spaces >> in city streets, and on the web 2.0, as was also the case with the Arab Spring, the 15-M movement in Spain and Occupy Wall Street in the United States, among other examples. This collective actor generated a performative being-together based on a call for democracy. The article examines the emergence, development, discourse and impact of #YoSoy132 through the analytical frameworks of collective action.

AB  - Conservation managers and policy makers require models that can rank the impacts of multiple, interacting threats on biodiversity so that actions can be prioritized. An integrated modelling framework was used to predict the viability of plant populations for five species in southern California's Mediterranean-type ecosystem. The framework integrates forecasts of land-use change from an urban growth model with projections of future climatically-suitable habitat from climate and species distribution models, which are linked to a stochastic population model. The population model incorporates the effects of disturbance regimes and management actions on population viability. This framework: (1) ranks threats by their relative and cumulative impacts on population viability, such as land-use change, climate change, altered disturbance regimes or invasive species, and (2) ranks management responses in terms of their effectiveness for land protection, assisted dispersal, fire management and invasive species control. Too-frequent fire was often the top threat for the species studied, thus fire reduction was ranked the most important management option. Projected changes in suitable habitat as a result of climate change were generally large, but varied across species and climate scenarios; urban development could exacerbate loss of suitable habitat.

Habitat loss in urban areas has led to the proliferation of certain species over others; in the case of birds, frugivores and certain predators can be found in abundance in cities. These birds, however, occasionally show novel behaviors that can cause stress within human-wildlife interactions. The black kite, Milvus migrans, for example, has displayed a tendency to attack humans for their food in certain urban areas in Japan. In order to determine how habitat availability and land-use types affected these aggressive tendencies, field observations were combined with GIS analysis of five locations along Sagami Bay in Japan. The following locations were assessed according to the amount of each land-use type present and the aggressive tendencies of each location's black kite population: Enoshima, Fujisawa; Kamakura Beach, Kamakura; Zushi Beach, Zushi; Oiso Beach, Oiso; and Iwa Beach, Manazuru. The aggression of each population, designated by the log of the aggression index, was found to be significantly affected by the amount of forest area per black kite, the amount of non-rice-paddy agricultural area per black kite, and the season. Thus, aggression was higher amongst populations with less forested or agricultural area within their foraging zones, and aggression increased during spring, which is the breeding season.

AB  - Understanding travel behaviour is significant in travel demand management as well as in urban and transport planning. Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this field are proposed for future studies. (C) 2013 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies.

AB  - To be effective in promoting the conservation of migratory wildlife, recipients of payment for ecosystem services (PES) most be willing to accept payment along the entire migratory corridor. This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept. (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between WTA and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation arid slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher WTA concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low WTA in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in WTA payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The unprecedented urban growth especially in developing countries has laid immense pressure on wetlands, finally threatening their existence altogether. A long-term monitoring of wetland ecosystems is the basis of planning conservation measures for a sustainable development. Deepor Beel, a Ramsar wetland and major storm water basin of the River Brahmaputra in the northeastern region of India, needs particular attention due to its constant degradation over the past decades. A rule-based classification algorithm was developed using Landsat (2011)-derived indices, namely Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field data as ancillary information. Field data, ALOS AVNIR and Google Earth images were used for accuracy assessment. A fuzzy accuracy assessment of the classified data sets showed an overall accuracy of 82 % for MAX criteria and 90 % for RIGHT criteria. The rules were used to classify major wetland cover types during low water season (January) in 1989, 2001 and 2012. The statistical analysis of the classified wetland showed heavy manifestation in aquatic vegetation and other features indicating severe eutrophication over the past 23 years. This degradation was closely related to major contributing anthropogenic factors, such as a railway line construction, growing croplands, waste disposal and illegal human settlements in the wetland catchment. In addition, the landscape development index (LDI) indicated a rapid increase in the impact of the surrounding land use on the wetland from 1989 to 2012. The techniques and results from this study may prove useful for top-down landscape analyses of this and other freshwater wetlands.

AB  - The authors contribute to the discussion on suburban developments by way of modeling the underlying social dynamics between suburban actors in two European suburban areas: the Wirral (Liverpool), UK and Leipzig, Germany. Data from questionnaires carried out in the two study areas are used to model social attraction and repulsion: that is, social segregation processes among socioeconomic groups. The model suggests that these social dynamics would, if other possible influences are ignored, lead to a situation of fluctuating residential in-migration and out-migration and to waves of suburbanization in the study regions. There are no persistent states: suburbanization would steadily continue until external-that is, not modeled-forces restrict movement, impact the spatial characteristics of the suburbs, or alter the social interactions among the actors. Suburban in-migration could only be reduced by strict planning regulations and/or other external forces which impact actor-class constellations and interdependencies, for example, by measures to restrict migration to more distant suburban locations and to provide preferential housing in the inner urban areas. The analysis further indicates that suburbs develop into independent residential areas, separate from the urban centers, as the primary source of migration to suburbs is no longer the urban centers; the vast majority of moves occur within suburbs or into suburbs from outside the region.

AB  - Forest management has a significant influence on the preferences of people for forest landscapes. This study sought to evaluate the dynamic effects of thinning intensities on the landscape value of forests over time. Five typical stands in Wuxiangsi National Forest Park in Nanjing, China, were subjected to a thinning experiment designed with four intensities: unthinned, light thinning, moderate thinning, and heavy thinning. People's preferences for landscape photographs taken in plots under various thinning intensities were assessed through scenic beauty estimation (SBE) at 2 and 5 years after thinning. The differences in scenic beauty value between different thinning intensities were then analyzed with a paired samples t test for the two periods. The results indicated that the landscape value of all of the thinned plots significantly exceeded that of the unthinned plots 2 years after thinning (p < 0.01) and that the heavily thinned plots were most appreciated, showing an average improvement of 9.71 % compared with the control plots. Additionally, the heavily thinned plots were judged to be more beautiful than the lightly thinned and moderately thinned plots, whereas there was no significant difference between moderate thinning and light thinning. At 5 years after thinning, however, the moderately thinned plots received the highest preference scores among the four intensities, displaying an average improvement of 11.32 % compared with the unthinned plots. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model indicated that landscape value improved with increases in the average diameter at breast height (DBH) and with the improvement of environmental cleanliness in the stand, whereas the value decreased with an increasing stem density, species diversity, litter coverage, and canopy density. In addition, we found that the performance of a neural network model based on a multilayer perception (MLP) algorithm for predicting scenic beauty was slightly better than that of the MLR model. The findings of our study suggest that moderate to heavy thinning should be recommended to manage forests for the improvement of forest landscape value.

AB  - In September 1910, during the Centennial celebration of Mexico's independence, Mexico City witnessed the inauguration of the Xochimilco Potable Waters Supply Works, marking the debut of 'modern water' in the capital. This was a shift from the traditional notion of water as a heterogeneous element expressive of diverse geographies and histories waters, that is to an understanding of water as a placeless, timeless natural substance. The transition to modern water and hydraulic control could never be a completed process. Rather, it would continue to evolve in tension with the great diversity of hydraulic histories and geographies of Mexico City. Different from most studies that analyze the Xochimilco system in the context of modernity, we see it as also a fundamentally visual phenomenon, an interaction among technologies of construction, representation, and access. This includes the architecture, its photographic representation, as well as an 1884 study that set forth the concept of 'potable waters' and argued a case for creating a modern network to deliver it. The Xochimilco works promised a flow as stable as its delivery system and as permanent as its photographic record. Drawing from Science and Technology Studies, recent work on the hydrosocial cycle, visual geography, and art history, we explore these waterworks' technologies as a novel but unstable confluence of objects, narratives, people, and places. For all the apparent durability of this network, the Xochimilco springs would run dry by the early 1930s. Instead of seeing water, we now see a collection of historical artifacts in the landscape and the archive. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological networks are known to influence ecosystem attributes, but we poorly understand how interspecific network structure affect population demography of multiple species, particularly for vertebrates. Establishing the link between network structure and demography is at the crux of being able to use networks to understand population dynamics and to inform conservation.
   We addressed the critical but unanswered question, does network structure explain demographic consequences of urbanization?
   We studied 141 ecological networks representing interactions between plants and nesting birds in forests across an urbanization gradient in Ohio, USA, from 2001 to 2011. Nest predators were identified by video-recording nests and surveyed from 2004 to 2011.
   As landscapes urbanized, bird-plant networks were more nested, less compartmentalized and dominated by strong interactions between a few species (i.e. low evenness). Evenness of interaction strengths promoted avian nest survival, and evenness explained demography better than urbanization, level of invasion, numbers of predators or other qualitative network metrics. Highly uneven networks had approximately half the nesting success as the most even networks. Thus, nest survival reflected how urbanization altered species interactions, particularly with respect to how nest placement affected search efficiency of predators.
   The demographic effects of urbanization were not direct, but were filtered through bird-plant networks. This study illustrates how network structure can influence demography at the community level and further, that knowledge of species interactions and a network approach may be requisite to understanding demographic responses to environmental change.

AB  - This research looks at post-2006-war reconstruction of the southern suburbs of Beirut under the auspices of Hezbollah (the Islamic resistance movement in Lebanon). The project was widely acclaimed as an alternative to current neoliberal planning practices in the Middle East and beyond. Based on a critical reading of the conception of property issues in this planning project, the article argues that this reconstruction presents a new geometry or alternative to the mainstream configuration of neoliberal urbanism, rather than a departure from its precepts. The reason for this is that the adopted language of property corresponds closely with the conception of property advocated by neoliberal planning, one that enshrines private, individual ownership as sacred and desirable and that works to strengthen its model in the city. I further argue that the 'neoliberal planning regime' within which Hezbollah's urban intervention occurs is not accidental; rather, it is necessary for the party's control of this space's future and for consolidating its territory in the city. It is hence expected that Hezbollah's planning in the city will produce the same decried effects as neoliberal planning elsewhere in the city rather than usher an innovative, progressive model of planning.

AB  - In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Many organisms have invaded urban habitats, although the underlying factors initially promoting urbanization remain poorly understood. Partial migration may facilitate urbanization because such populations benefit from surplus food in urban environments during winter, and hence enjoy reduced fitness costs of migratory deaths. We tested this hypothesis in the European blackbird Turdus merula, which has been urbanized since the 19th century, by compiling information on timing of urbanization, migratory status, and population density for 99 cities across the continent. Timing of urbanization was spatially auto-correlated at scales up to 600 km. Analyses of timing of urbanization revealed that urbanization occurred earlier in partially migratory and resident populations than in migratory populations of blackbirds. Independently, this effect was most pronounced in the range of the distribution that currently has the highest population density, suggesting that urbanization facilitated population growth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that timing of urbanization is facilitated by partial migration, resulting in subsequent residency and population growth.

AB  - In current society, with the rapid development of science and technology, the media has obtained a new leap, and its development form has become diversified. The outdoor advertisement media is another advertisement publishing form apart from advertisement, television, newspapers and network. This media also plays an important role in the social development of the new era. The outdoor advertisement development has an important influence on a city. This advertisement media has also occupied a very important position in the social development of the new era. The outdoor advertisement development has an important influence on a city. The connotation of city image includes the economy, culture and civilization construction of a city, and the outside expression of its image is mainly in the aspect of city landscape planning and management.
   The outdoor advertisement has made the economy and culture of a city prosperous, and it represents the overall image and development level of a city. Outdoor advertisement processing on city's architecture environment, road facilities and city culture and even the city's overall image can directly influence the city's economy and culture and other aspects of coordination development. Therefore, we should actively guide the reasonable market competition and standardize the market behavior for the survival of the fittest. The outdoor advertisement, which can bring creative, innovative image and positive energy influence for the city, has a positive meaning, in order to improve the lofty image of city economy, culture and civilization. This paper analyzes the influence of outdoor advertisement development on city image, and it analyzes and puts forward the corresponding countermeasures for the existing problems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the structural changes of the landscape in the River Basin of the Aguapei River/MT, in the years 1991 and 2011, through the use of geotechnologies and metrics. This study is based on a categorical approach, which classes discrete belonging to the vegetation cover and land use were identified and mapped by means of geotechnologies and characterized quantitatively by indices of Landscape Ecology, adopting the conceptual model of "stain-corridor-matrix'. It was found that the landscape of the study area form a mosaic, showing an array consisting of savanna (Cerrado), with several spots of livestock, and an area of influence urban, being that the latter class did not exist in 1991, and the corridor formed by alluvial forest in River Basin of the Aguapei. The data showed a decrease in the area occupied by savanna vegetation and the growth of the agricultural activity in the period analyzed. In case of this pattern is maintained, indicates that in the next 20 years may be the matrix of the basin be constituted by agricultural activity resulting in simplification of ecosystems. Thus, there is a need for regional development policies of Mato Grosso prioritize environmental conservation, which will reflect in land use planning, to improve the permeability of the landscape.

AB  - The present study analyzes the impact of long-term urban expansion on soil depletion in Emilia-Romagna, an agricultural-specialized region of northern Italy. Using settlement density maps at three points in time (1945, 1971 and 2001) dense and diffused urbanization trends were assessed and correlated with soil quality. Nonurbanized land decreased from 11.8% in 1945 to 6.3% in 2001. Urbanization dynamics between 1945 and 1971 reflect the increase of dense settlements around pre-existing urban centers. To the contrary, a discontinuous, low- and medium-density urban expansion along the road network and in the most fertile lowland areas was observed between 1971 and 2001. Overall, urbanization consumed soils with progressively higher quality. However, a diverging trend was observed in the two investigated time intervals: soil with high quality was occupied by compact and dense settlements during 1945-1971 and by discontinuous, medium- and lowdensity settlements during 1971-2001. These findings document the polarization in areas with low and high soil capital and may reflect disparities in agricultural production and increasing environmental degradation. Moreover, the analysis shows a diverging trend between land and soil consumption patterns suggesting that the edification of pervious land is an unreliable indicator of soil quality depletion. Taken together, the results of this study illustrate the (increasing) spatial mismatch between agricultural land and high-quality soils as a consequence of urbanization-driven landscape transformations and may inform measures to contain soil depletion driven by economic growth.

AB  - This paper presents partial outcomes of the project called 'The Diversity of the Development Processes of Small and Medium-Sized Towns and its Influence on the Polycentric Development of Poland'. The research conducted within that project has been based on the identification of two basic groups of Polish towns, regarding their locations either within the functional area boundaries of the regional capital cities (functional areas of voivodship centre), or outside. The goal of our research is to determine whether small and medium-sized towns maintain their roles as stable elements of the settlement network and their development is diverse, depending on their neighbourhood in respect of the regional capitals. The population and the employment fluctuation rates constitute some of a dozen of development indicators under examination. The changes in those indicators' values were identified in the period of 1995-2010, and additionally, two more subperiods were identified: 1995-2003 and 2003-2010.
   Our research discovered essential differences in the population rates of small and medium-sized towns located in the functional areas of regional capital cities (Group I) and outside (Group II). In 1995-2010, we observed an increase of population in Group I and it was the only Group of towns with growing population nationwide.
   In view of the generally non-beneficial changes in the number of the employed nationwide in 1995-2010, a better situation occurred in the towns belonging to Group I. In some of the Polish regions, we found an increase of the number of the employed in that group of towns. An essential national increase of the number of the employed, identified in the sub-period of 2003-2010, was larger in the towns of Group I than Group II.(C) 2014 Nicolaus Copernicus University Press.

AB  - The sequence of events occurring in Sao Paulo city, which had as first motivator the increase of the public transport fares in R$ 0,20 (twenty cents of Real, something about U. S.$ 0,10), on June 2, 2013, led thousands of people to the main avenues of the city to protest against it. Quickly, the protests led by the Free Pass Movement (FPM), about seven in all, had wide support of young students and the public. The text aims to analyze the relationship between technology and society from the pursuit of understanding the relationship between social networks and the act the people to join the street demonstrations. The article discusses the meanings of participation in those events based in the understanding of the concepts of identity and identification in a context of mass. The text is part of developing research that discusses the "new" way of social interaction in view of the growing computerization of social relations in the contemporary moment.

AB  - Historically, prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) have been considered essential keystone species of western United States grassland ecosystems because they provide unique services and increase vegetation community richness, evenness, and diversity. However, the effects of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) on lands adjacent to or surrounded by urban areas may not result in the same ecosystem benefits historically associated with their presence. An urban landscape presents prairie dogs with movement challenges unparalleled in natural landscapes, as well as suites of nonnative plant species that are more common in disturbed areas. This study examined a complex ecosystem where vegetation communities are being influenced by directional environmental change, and quantified the synergistic effects resulting from the protective management of a native keystone species. The data set for this analysis was comprised of 71 paired (occupied by prairie dogs vs. unoccupied) vegetation surveys and 156 additional unpaired surveys collected from around the city of Boulder, Colorado, USA for 14 yr. Linear mixed models were used to compare data from transects occupied and unoccupied by prairie dogs, as well as to evaluate the effect of prairie dog occupation duration. In the absence of prairie dogs, vegetation in this region exhibited declines in native grasses, no changes in introduced grasses, and increases in native and nonnative forbs and bare soil over the study interval. In the presence of prairie dogs, these observed directional changes were nearly all amplified at rates four to 10 times greater than when prairie dogs were absent. Areas in Boulder occupied by prairie dogs also had significantly lower richness, evenness, and diversity of plant species, compared to unoccupied areas. Analysis of plant functional groups revealed the significant reduction of perennial native grasses, as well as a significantly higher cover of introduced forbs in occupied areas. Prairie dogs amplified the effects of low-impact environmental directional changes, creating more novel vegetation communities than the environmental factors alone. Results from this research provide insight regarding the synergistic effects of a native keystone species within a complex human-impacted 21st century landscape.

AB  - This article analyses a database of 55 squatted social centres in Brighton. By virtue of their public nature, these projects provide a lens through which to examine the local political squatters' movement, which was often underground, private and hidden (residential squatting in contrast is not profiled). Several relevant non-squatted spaces are also included since they were used as organisational hubs by squatters. The data was gathered from a mixture of participant observation, reference to archive materials, conversations with squatters past and present, academic sources and activist websites. The projects are assessed in turn by time period, duration, type of building occupied and location (by ward). Significant individual projects are described and two boom periods identified, namely the late 1990s and recent years. Reasons for the two peaks in activity are suggested and criticised. It is argued that social centres bloomed in the 1990s as part of the larger anti-globalisation movement and more recently as a tool of resistance against the criminalisation of squatting. Tentative conclusions are reached concerning the cycles, contexts and institutionalisation of the squatters' movement. It is suggested that the movement exists in ebbs and flows, influenced by factors both internal (such as the small, transitory nature of the milieu) and external (such as frequent evictions). This research feeds into a larger research project (MOVOKEUR) analysing the various squatters' movement in cities across Western Europe.

AB  - Monitoring the deformation of urban infrastructure is crucial for improving safety and reducing economic loss. Ground deformation (caused by construction, groundwater extraction etc.) can be measured with millimeter accuracy using advanced stacking techniques in differential SAR interferometry. However, deformation might also occur due to thermal dilation of complex urban objects such as buildings and bridges, resulting in structural stress and thus, a need for monitoring. High resolution SAR missions e.g. TerraSAR-X provide a unique opportunity to measure such small seasonal displacements. This paper investigates different techniques such as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), Distributed Scatterer Interferometry (DSI), Stable Point Network (SPN) and Small Baseline Subset Algorithm (SBAS) for thermal dilation monitoring of complex urban infrastructure using X-band SAR data.

AB  - In recent times there is an accelerated movement in the privatization of public land. Some representative cases are the names of subway stops and central squares being associated with the brands of large corporations. Consequently the city centers are becoming an ambiguous territory making it unclear what is public and private. Additionally these newly established social practices have consequences and poses questions as where private ground begins (and ends) and how the freedom to use such spaces are affected? The privatization of public land appears to be an encroaching process and standard as similar patterns were found in other European cities. In our research, we have observed that a chronotope has been generated and repeated in this process. Similarities in London and Madrid were found during our ethnographic work allowing us to assert that any change or social transformation happens as a product of its historical context. The purpose of this paper is to present the Occupy Movement as a collective action and to create an archive that supports collective actions and emotions. The results of this analysis will show how to recognize if a square is private, public or almost public.

AB  - Birds that reside in urban settings face numerous human-related threats to survival, including mortality from bird-window collisions (BWCs). Our current understanding of this issue has largely been driven by data collected during spring and fall migration, and patterns of collision mortality during the summer breeding season remain relatively unexplored. We assessed BWCs during four breeding seasons (2009-2012) at a site in northwestern Illinois, USA, by comparing the abundance, richness, migratory class, and age of the species living around buildings to species mortally wounded by window collisions. We also systematically assessed the daily timing of BWCs throughout the breeding season. We documented BWCs in 4 of 25 (16%) species and 7 of 21 (33%) species in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The relationship between BWCs and abundance depended on age. For adults, BWCs were highest in the least abundant species, e.g., Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), and lowest in species with high abundance values, e.g., Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina). For juveniles, mortality was greatest for the most abundant species, and the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) accounted for 62% of all juvenile carcasses. Early in the breeding season, collision mortality was restricted to adults of Long-distance Migrants, whereas juveniles of all three migratory guilds (Long-distance and Short-distance Migrants and Permanent Residents) died at windows from late June through early August. Daily mortality for all species was highest between sunrise-1600 h and lowest from 1600 h-sunrise the next day. Generally, the species observed as carcasses matched birds considered a 'high risk' for BWCs, e.g., Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), and those considered 'low risk' were not observed as carcasses, e.g., Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea). Our results suggest that the number of BWCs during the breeding season does not necessarily increase with abundance, but rather appears related to variation among species and age classes, which may have important implications on the population health of affected species. The mechanisms driving these differences are unknown, but may be related reproductive behavior, flight speed, distance movements, and dispersal patterns.

AB  - This article aims to analyze some of the implications of the committees of functional diversity created in two Spanish cities during the 15M camps of 2011. Firstly, we situate them in the context of the historical evolution of disability activisms in Spain. Secondly, we describe the main traits of such committees within the 15M, based on their published materials on the Internet along with the assessments of some participants. Once contextualized, we analyze what we have considered the main contribution of the committees. It is the experience of "putting the body in the square", a form of embodied politics performed at the public space. This opened a debate on the logics of exclusion inclusion within citizenship, and in turn it got back the awareness that precariousness and vulnerability are common traits of every human being. Therefore, we conclude that the committees of functional diversity represented a significant moment for both the disability activism and the 15M movement, with their use of the body as a liberatory tool to question the very definition of the human

AB  - Case studies of urban squatting in the United States and The Netherlands, and the fight against sexual violence in Spain and in The Netherlands, form the empirical basis of an analysis of the features and development of autonomous and institutionalized social movements, and the interaction between them. Autonomous and institutionalized social movements have different strengths that they derive from characteristics that are not compatible. Nevertheless, a dynamic is possible that combines the strengths of both models. It provides synergy between self-contained autonomous and institutionalized movements, without imposing trade-offs. Political opportunity theory suggests that such a 'dual movement structure' is most relevant when the political system is selectively open. Interaction between the movements is conditioned by the mainstreaming potential of the issue or interest that is at stake. Even when relations are tense, movements can create opportunities for each other. Autonomous movements are able to retain a repertoire of disruptive actions when lobbying is the more popular option. An autonomous movement can benefit from the legitimacy and supporting network engendered by an institutionalized movement, pioneering work done by an autonomous movement can inspire an institutionalized counterpart. Autonomous movements can provide a critical voice when co-optation occurs.

AB  - Florida will continue to undergo high rates of habitat loss, primarily the result of urbanization. In addition, invasive species are a major threat to Florida's biodiversity. The Florida mottled duck (Anas fulvigula), a bird unique to the state, is particularly vulnerable to loss of wetland habitats and hybridization with feral mallards. Because mottled ducks are more likely to encounter feral mallards in urban habitats, we trapped and radiomarked adult females in urban (n=99) and rural (n=146) habitats to estimate home ranges and rates of movement into and out of urban areas. We also determined habitat use in urban and rural areas during the breeding (1 Feb-31 Jul), post-breeding (1 Aug-18 Nov), and hunting (19 Nov-31 Jan) periods and estimated seasonal habitat selection of rural female mottled ducks. Urban females used mostly aquatic habitats in low and high intensity human development year-round. Rural ducks used freshwater marshes throughout the year, but selection of other habitat types varied seasonally. Use of glades marsh and agricultural habitats by rural ducks peaked during the breeding season. Rural ducks selected artificial impoundments and reservoirs during the post-breeding and hunting periods. Median home range size of rural females was more than 65 times greater than those of urban females. Our results suggest the spread of mallard genetic introgression caused by females leaving urban areas may be slow because as few as 6% of the adult females moved between urban and rural areas. Focusing wetland conservation efforts on freshwater marshes and artificial impoundments in south Florida would likely benefit mottled ducks. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The application of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for detecting terrain deformation in the Amazon region is an important research tool that allows high accuracy of geophysical models based on satellite data. Amazonian forest cover and climate regime make InSAR implementation very difficult, so literature about the subject in that region is still rare. In this paper, we apply the interferometric technique to a stack of 24 Radarsat-2 images acquired from 2008 to 2010 over Manaus city (Amazonas state, Brazil) aiming to understand the terrain movement in the urban area, which has been detected by previous studies using Radarsat-1 data. The observed subsidence is estimated to be about three centimeters and occurs in the vicinities of the international airport. The phenomena can be associated with the Amazonas river flooding system, and indicates a local response from the seasonal fluctuations and Earth's elasticity.

AB  - Background: Dengue is an increasingly important public health problem in most Latin American countries and more cost-effective ways of reducing dengue vector densities to prevent transmission are in demand by vector control programs. This multi-centre study attempted to identify key factors associated with vector breeding and development as a basis for improving targeted intervention strategies.
   Methods: In each of 5 participant cities in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil and Uruguay, 20 clusters were randomly selected by grid sampling to incorporate 100 contiguous households, non-residential private buildings (businesses) and public spaces. Standardized household surveys, cluster background surveys and entomological surveys specifically targeted to obtain pupal indices for Aedes aegypti, were conducted in the dry and wet seasons.
   Results: The study clusters included mainly urban low-middle class populations with satisfactory infrastructure and -except for Uruguay- favourable climatic conditions for dengue vector development. Household knowledge about dengue and "dengue mosquitoes" was widespread, mainly through mass media, but there was less awareness around interventions to reduce vector densities. Vector production (measured through pupal indices) was favoured when water containers were outdoor, uncovered, unused (even in Colombia and Ecuador where the large tanks used for household water storage and washing were predominantly productive) and -particularly during the dry season- rainwater filled. Larval infestation did not reflect productive container types. All productive container types, including those important in the dry season, were identified by pupal surveys executed during the rainy season.
   Conclusions: A number of findings are relevant for improving vector control: 1) there is a need for complementing larval surveys with occasional pupal surveys (to be conducted during the wet season) for identifying and subsequently targeting productive container types; 2) the need to raise public awareness about useful and effective interventions in productive container types specific to their area; and 3) the motivation for control services that-according to this and similar studies in Asia- dedicated, targeted vector management can make a difference in terms of reducing vector abundance.

AB  - Land consolidation (LC) is essential for ensuring rural development and for increasing land use effectiveness. LC has been implemented in China since the mid-1990s in an attempt to increase available cropland area, reduce fragmentation and promote agricultural production capacity. The purpose of this study is to identify the changes resulting from the land consolidation project (LCP) implementation, and to develop a parametric approach to assess the resource-environment effects. This study could promote the LCP planning, and provide the support for the decision-making of the LC authorities. The Tianmen land consolidation project in Hubei Province of China was chosen as a case study. The results of the case study showed LCP implementation results in great changes in land use types and their proportions, connectivity of field-roads, irrigation systems and drainage systems, plot numbers, plot shape and plot size. These changes bring both positive and negative effects to region environmental and economic system. Positive effects were demonstrated in agricultural production capacity and agricultural production cost and the negative effects were expressed by the ecosystem services value, landscape diversity and human disturbance intensity.

AB  - In cyclic populations, fluctuations in abundance may be spatially asynchronous. This asynchrony can lead to the emergence of complex patterns, such as travelling waves. At present, landscape heterogeneity (driven by factors such as habitat quality and physical dispersal limitations) is often considered to be instrumental in generating travelling waves. In this study, 15 years of town-level abundance data obtained from cyclic water vole populations in the Jura mountain range in France (Doubs Department) were analysed. The results of this analysis suggest the presence of a wave that is moving at a speed of 7.4 km/year and at a perpendicular angle to one of the major physical obstacles to vole dispersal. At the local scale, the wave's propagation is slowed by the presence of habitat that is unfavourable to water voles, such hedgerow networks and forested areas.

AB  - The spectacle of the encampments that occupied public plazas throughout Spain during the 15-M protests of 2011 asserted what urban theorist Henri Lefebvre (1968) and others have called the "right to the city." In a similar vein, the free open-air performances on All Saints' Day in 2011 and 2012 of Jose Zorrilla's Don Juan Tenorio by the theater collective AlmaViva Teatro in the self-managed neighborhood space called the Campo de Cebada have also been an effort to reclaim urban space. These performances called Don Juan Tenorio en La Cebada are notable not only for their use of a repurposed vacant lot left abandoned in the wake of the financial crisis but also for their dynamic staging that required the public to move throughout the large vacant lot for each of the play's seven acts. As the public traversed the reappropriated space of the Campo de Cebada, the performance was framed by the urban backdrop created by the bright lights of the Teatro Latina and the adjacent residential apartment buildings. This movement of the public not only foregrounded the trope of mobility evoked by the shifting dramatic spaces within Zorrilla's work but also the mobile and changing character of urban space produced by the perpetual investment and divestment of speculative capital. Just as Don Juan Tenorio journeys from the physical world to the spiritual one and moves from a secular space of individualism to the communal space of heaven, these performances have created an urban experience that promotes community and connection that stands in stark contrast to the cold, individualistic logic of mobile capital and real estate speculation that characterized the economic bubble that preceded the current crisis.

AB  - Wildfires can result in significant economic and social losses. Prescribed fire is commonly applied to reduce fuel loads and thereby decrease future fire risk to life and property. Fuel treatments can occur in the landscape or adjacent to houses. Location of the prescribed burns can significantly alter the risk of house loss. Furthermore the cost of treating fuels in the landscape is far cheaper than treating fuels adjacent to the houses. Here we develop a Bayesian Network to examine the relative reduction in risk that can be achieved by prescribed burning in the landscape compared with a 500 m interface zone adjacent to houses. We then compare costs of management treatments to determine the most cost-effective method of reducing risk to houses. Burning in the interface zone resulted in the greatest reduction in risk of fires reaching the houses and the intensity of these fires. Fuel treatment in the interface zone allows for a direct transfer of benefits from the fuel treatment. Costs of treating fuels in the interface were significantly higher on a per hectare basis, but the extent of area requiring treatment was considerably lower. Results of this study demonstrate that treatment of fuels at the interface is not only the best means of reducing risk, it is also the most cost-effective.

AB  - Arboreal marsupials play an essential role in ecosystem function including regulating insect and plant populations, facilitating pollen and seed dispersal and acting as a prey source for higher-order carnivores in Australian environments. Primarily, research has focused on their biology, ecology and response to disturbance in forested and urban environments. We used presence-only species distribution modelling to understand the relationship between occurrences of arboreal marsupials and eco-geographical variables, and to infer habitat suitability across an urban gradient. We used post-proportional analysis to determine whether increasing urbanization affected potential habitat for arboreal marsupials. The key eco-geographical variables that influenced disturbance intolerant species and those with moderate tolerance to disturbance were natural features such as tree cover and proximity to rivers and to riparian vegetation, whereas variables for disturbance tolerant species were anthropogenic-based (e. g., road density) but also included some natural characteristics such as proximity to riparian vegetation, elevation and tree cover. Arboreal marsupial diversity was subject to substantial change along the gradient, with potential habitat for disturbance-tolerant marsupials distributed across the complete gradient and potential habitat for less tolerant species being restricted to the natural portion of the gradient. This resulted in highly-urbanized environments being inhabited by a few generalist arboreal marsupial species. Increasing urbanization therefore leads to functional simplification of arboreal marsupial assemblages, thus impacting on the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Background: The nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a zoonotic parasite and the most important cause of eosinophilic meningitis worldwide in humans. In Brazil, this disease has been reported in the states of Espirito Santo and Pernambuco. The parasite has been detected in the naturally infected intermediate host, in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco and Santa Catarina. The murid Rattus norvegicus R. rattus were recently reported to be naturally infected in Brazil. In this study, we conducted a two-year investigation of the dissemination pattern of A. cantonensis in R. norvegicus in an urban area of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, and examined the influence of seasonality, year, host weight and host gender on parasitological parameters of A. cantonensis in rats.
   Methods: The study was conducted in an area of Trindade, Sao Goncalo municipality, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Prevalence of infected rats, intensity and abundance of A. cantonensis were calculated, and generalized linear models were created and compared to verify the contribution of host gender, host weight, year and seasonality to the variations in A. cantonensis abundance and prevalence in rats.
   Results: The prevalence of A. cantonensis infection was stable during the rainy (71%, CI 58.9-81.6) and dry seasons (71%, CI 57.9-80.8) and was higher in older rats and in females. Seasonality, host weight (used as a proxy of animal age) and gender were all contributing factors to variation in parasite abundance, with females and heavier (older) animals showing larger abundance of parasites, and extreme values of parasite abundance being more frequent in the dry season.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of this parasite throughout the study suggests that its transmission is stable and that conditions are adequate for the spread of the parasite to previously unaffected areas. Dispersion of the parasite to new areas may be mediated by males that tend to have larger dispersal ability, while females may be more important for maintaining the parasite on a local scale due to their higher prevalence and abundance of infection. A multidisciplinary approach considering the ecological distribution of the rats and intermediate hosts, as well as environmental features is required to further understand the dynamics of angiostrongyliasis.

AB  - River floodplains comprise about 7 percent of the land area of the United States and are areas of great biodiversity and ecological productivity, much of which is due to the many connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems in these settings. The flat topography of floodplains, however, means that they are also ideal sites for transportation infrastructure that can disconnect the river from the surrounding landscape. Few studies have examined the role of roads and railroads as components of river system structure and function at landscape scales. In this study, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and easily obtainable data to map the extent of floodplain disconnection caused by transportation infrastructure across two river basins in Washington State. Digital geologic or soils data, along with digital elevation data, provide the extent of total floodplain area, and transportation data define the extent of disconnection. Our results show that 44 percent to 58 percent of the total floodplain area in the three study basins is disconnected by these roads and railroads. Transportation infrastructure disconnected between 17 percent and 64 percent of the floodplain area in the individual study reaches. Federal Emergency Management Agency floodplain data often show where floodplains are truncated by infrastructure, particularly by large features or in urban areas, but do not capture the loss of total floodplain area. Relatively simple broad-scale documentation of infrastructure and floodplain disconnection has potential for guiding further study of floodplain fragmentation at multiple scales, providing an impetus for improving infrastructure design and repair and helping inform aquatic and floodplain management activities. ??????????????????????, ?????????????????????, ????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????, ????????

Palabras claveAproximadamente el 7 por ciento del area terrestre de los Estados Unidos corresponde a las planicies fluviales de inundacion, espacios dotados de gran biodiversidad y productividad ecologica, mucho de lo cual esta determinado por numerosas conexiones entre los sistemas acuaticos y emergidos de estos entornos. Sin embargo, la topografia plana de estas llanuras las hace tambien ideales como asiento de la infraestructura del transporte, con lo cual se desconecta el rio del paisaje circundante. Son escasos los estudios que han examinado el papel de las carreteras y los ferrocarriles como componentes del sistema estructural y funcional del rio a escala de paisaje. En el presente estudio, usamos los sistemas de informacion geografica (SIG) y datos que se pueden obtener con facilidad para mapear la amplitud de la desconexion de la llanura inundable, ocasionada por la infraestructura del transporte, en dos cuencas fluviales del estado de Washington. Los datos digitales de naturaleza geologica o pedologica, junto con datos digitales de elevacion del terreno, satisfacen lo necesario para la totalidad del area inundable, en tanto que los datos sobre transporte definen la amplitud de la desconexion.
   Nuestros resultados indican que, como efecto de estas carreteras y ferrocarriles, entre el 44 y el 58 por ciento del area total de la planicie de inundacion en las tres cuencas del estudio se halla desconectado. La infraestructura del transporte desconecto entre el 17 y 64 por ciento del area de la planicie de inundacion dentro del ambito del estudio. Los datos de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias relacionados con estas llanuras a menudo indican donde estan truncadas por la infraestructura, en particular por elementos mayores, o en las areas urbanas, pero no captan la perdida de area total de la llanura. La documentacion general relativamente simple sobre infraestructura y desconexion de la llanura de inundacion es prometedora como guia para mayores estudios de fragmentacion en este tipo de terreno, a multiples escalas, generando un impulso a la mejora del diseno y reparacion de la infraestructura y ayudando a informar las actividades del manejo acuatico y de la llanura inundable.

AB  - This paper analyses the location patterns of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) in Europe in line with the most recent literature. Our main contribution is to provide new evidence about the location patterns of KIBS considering the European continent, as opposed to individual countries, as the unit of analysis. We first present the concentration and specialisation patterns of KIBS activities in Europe, including the variations that have occurred during the last few years. Second, we try to provide an explanation of KIBS regional specialisation patterns on the basis of the factors identified by the literature. The results suggest that KIBS activities are highly geographically concentrated in Europe. In this respect, capital cities, which have increasingly emerged as strongly specialised locations in services, play a central role in geography of KIBS. At the same time, there is also evidence of a tendency of sparse dispersal of KIBS throughout European regions. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of agglomeration externalities, market size, regional accessibility, regional knowledge base, and the institutional nature of the regional capital city. Finally, regarding changes in KIBS regional specialisation, we find that these are largely associated to changes in regional GDP.

AB  - Ungulate vehicle collisions (UVC) provoke serious damage, including human casualties, and a large number of measures have been developed around the world to avoid collisions. We analyse the main factors involved in UVC in a road network built in the absence of ungulates, where mitigation structures to avoid UVC were not adequately considered. Ungulate population greatly increased during the last two decades and now Roe Deer and Wild Boars are widely distributed over the study area, but even after this increase, the road network was not adapted to avoid UVC. A total of 235 Roe Deer (RDVC) and 153 Wild Boar vehicle collisions (WBVC) were recorded between January 2008 and December 2011. We randomly selected 289 sample points (87 RDVC, 60 WBVC and 142 controls) separated by at least 500 metres from the next closest point and measured 19 variables that could potentially influence the vehicle collisions. We detected variations in the frequency of RDVC on a monthly basis, and WBVC was higher at weekends but no significant differences were detected on a monthly basis. UVC were more likely to occur at locations where sinuosity of the road, velocity, surface of shrub and deciduous forest area were greater, the presence of fences entered with positive relationship and distance to the nearest building was less. RDVC were more likely to occur at locations where timber forest area increased and distance to the nearest building decreased and WBVC was related to open fields cover and also to the presence of fences. Sinuosity and velocity entered in both cases as significant factors. Major roads, in which the traffic volume is greater and faster, caused more accidents with ungulates than secondary roads. Nowadays, the high frequency of ungulate road-kills deserves a new strategy in order to adapt infrastructure and adopt mitigation measures.

AB  - The Feldbach district is situated near the town of Feldbach in the southeastern province of Styria, Austria. Since 2007, a climate observation network of 151 climate stations within an area of approximately 20 x 15 km (grid cell 1.4 x 1.4 km) has provided a unique collection of spatial and temporal meteorological data. Examining short-lived ruderal and arable weed communities, we search for correlations and spatial patterns between the community composition and climate data. Do such plant communities respond to temperature differences within an agricultural landscape and on a regional scale? Data of 277 releves from short-lived weed communities were collected across the investigated area during the summer of 2011. Releves were assigned to the corresponding climate stations and classified. Average Ellenberg indicator values for temperature were calculated for each releve and community cluster. Measured temperature data were assigned and correlated with community data by applying linear regression and redundancy analyses (RDA). The classification resulted in six associations; the two most frequently observed associations were divided into subtypes resulting in 13 vegetation clusters that could be analyzed further. A significant relationship could be found only between the clusters of arable weed communities and the average winter temperatures. Site variables explain twice as much variance as measured climate variables; this ratio changes to 50 : 50 when we analyzed only arable field community data. No clear spatial patterns concerning mean annual temperature were visible. However, the Setaria faberi subtype of the Echinochloo-Setarietum and the Sorghum halepense subtype of the Convolvulo-Agropyretum show a tendency toward a temperature-induced spatial pattern, such that both were sensitive to winter temperature. On a regional scale, the occurrence and composition of short-lived ruderal plant communities correlated weakly with climate variables. However, the studied arable weed communities showed a certain tendency to follow small-scale temperature differences, especially those of average winter temperature. We conclude that short-lived weed communities have the potential to be indicators for global warming, but the spatial temperature gradients are not clear enough in our approach to allow the production of better regression models and elucidation of distinct spatial patterns.

AB  - The occupy movement of summer 2011 provides an opportunity to examine practical and theoretical implications of the notion of planning justice and human rights. Analyzing the discourse by activists in a planning team associated with the Israeli Protest Movement reveals inner conflicts and debates regarding the meanings of justice and human rights in planning. The discourse exposes an ongoing rift between spatial professionals (mainly geographers, planners, and architects) and subfields (municipal and governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations, and academia) related to applying ideas of just planning in the Israeli context. Specifically, two opposing schemas of planning justice appearthat of socio-spatial justice and urban justice. A further investigation links each schema with a different principle of justice, as defined in Rawls' Theory of Justice: The first schema is associated with the principle of difference and the second with the principle of fair equality of opportunity. Together, the unsettled conflicts hint at an inconsistency occurring when the theory is interpreted in practice.

AB  - Because invasive species are often opportunistic and behaviourally flexible, they tend to be successful in urban landscapes, where they may use space differently than in their more traditional habitats. Consequently, control strategies developed for invasive pest species in non-urban areas may not succeed in an urban context. Using GPS tracking, we examined habitat use by an invasive pest, the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in residential New Zealand habitats; these habitats comprise a large proportion of the urban landscape and are currently not targeted for pest control. We predicted that home ranges of possums in residential areas would be larger than those in non-urban habitats due to lower densities of their primary food resource, plant material; that possums would prefer forest fragment habitat; and that they would avoid roads due to the mortality risk. Home range sizes estimated using mechanistic Brownian bridges and 100 % minimum convex polygons were smaller or similar in size to those recorded in rural and forest habitats. Resource utilization functions and the regression of utilization distribution probabilities against environmental variables showed that possums selected forest fragments primarily, followed by residential habitat characterised by large gardens with a degree of vegetative structural complexity. Roads were not avoided. Control operations should expand their scope to include residential areas containing mature, diverse vegetation rather than only focussing on forest fragments, a strategy that ignores biodiversity values in residential habitats, and is likely to be unsuccessful due to reinvasion potential from neighbouring residential areas.

AB  - We review the reception of Peripheral Marginal Literature in the Brazilian literary field. This literary movement, born at the turn of the century, is produced by subjects identified with spaces of social exclusion, such as urban peripheries, favelas, or prisons. At first, some works of this kind were received with surprise, celebrating what was considered to be an "unusual discovery". There was usually an emphasis on its "internal view" of these universes, with books that propose "multiple reading pacts", combining the novelistic, the testimonial, and the auto-biographical. However, this consideration does no justice to the wealth and diversity of this movement which, with the proliferation of saraus on the peripheries of Sao Paulo, is forming an independent " literary system" marked by orality and the performative dimension of literature. In this new scenario, hegemonic criticism remains deaf.

AB  - Background: Empiric evidence shows that Aedes aegypti abundance is spatially heterogeneous and that some areas and larval habitats produce more mosquitoes than others. There is a knowledge gap, however, with regards to the temporal persistence of such Ae. aegypti abundance hotspots. In this study, we used a longitudinal entomologic dataset from the city of Iquitos, Peru, to (1) quantify the spatial clustering patterns of adult Ae. aegypti and pupae counts per house, (2) determine overlap between clusters, (3) quantify the temporal stability of clusters over nine entomologic surveys spaced four months apart, and (4) quantify the extent of clustering at the household and neighborhood levels.
   Methodologies/Principal Findings: Data from 13,662 household entomological visits performed in two Iquitos neighborhoods differing in Ae. aegypti abundance and dengue virus transmission was analyzed using global and local spatial statistics. The location and extent of Ae. aegypti pupae and adult hotspots (i.e., small groups of houses with significantly [p < 0.05] high mosquito abundance) were calculated for each of the 9 entomologic surveys. The extent of clustering was used to quantify the probability of finding spatially correlated populations. Our analyses indicate that Ae. aegypti distribution was highly focal (most clusters do not extend beyond 30 meters) and that hotspots of high vector abundance were common on every survey date, but they were temporally unstable over the period of study.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings have implications for understanding Ae. aegypti distribution and for the design of surveillance and control activities relying on household-level data. In settings like Iquitos, where there is a relatively low percentage of Ae. aegypti in permanent water-holding containers, identifying and targeting key premises will be significantly challenged by shifting hotspots of Ae. aegypti infestation. Focusing efforts in large geographic areas with historically high levels of transmission may be more effective than targeting Ae. aegypti hotspots.

AB  - Rural abandonment in mountainous regions is a habitual process that occurs in many countries and has socioeconomic and environmental implications. Land cover changes in Mediterranean mountains resulting from farming abandonment have been associated with certain processes of land degradation. This study employed Landsat satellite images for mapping the land cover changes in 1984 and 2007, south of the Iberian Range (region of Sierra de Albarracin, Teruel, Spain). A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century. The primary sector and the associated secondary sector (farming and forestry) were diminished and resulted in a decrease in natural resource exploitation. Economic activity moved towards the tertiary sector, which focuses on rural tourism. The current socioeconomic scenario has unknown future implications for land cover dynamics and their associated ecosystem services values. Thus, monitoring of land cover changes and ecosystem services is required to promote sustainable development in an area that is highly dependent on the conservation of natural resources and ecological services.

AB  - In river restoration a key goal is to predict the nature of the communities that will develop following restoration efforts and to forecast recovery rates and trajectories. Thus restoration ecology must be underpinned by knowledge of the pattern and process of ecological colonisation and succession. Here we investigate patterns of microinvertebrate (organisms passing through a 1 mm sieve but retained on a 63 mu m one) colonisation and succession in a newly constructed urban river, the Jubilee River in Southern England, over 8 years. We also examine how the microinvertebrate assemblage in the Jubilee River differs from that in the adjacent River Thames and draw some lessons for river restoration.
   Total microinvertebrate abundance and richness in the River Jubilee differed significantly across years and community similarity (Jaccard's) was typically above 0.6 and increased towards the end of the study. Of the 17 microinvertebrate taxa collected in 2001, 14 were still found in 2007, suggesting that the tolerance model may be a major mechanism in the succession of microinvertebrate communities of new streams. Microinvertebrate assemblage composition was significantly different across years (ANOSIM) in the Jubilee River. NMDS showed that there were strong shifts between some years, particularly following high flows. Overall our results suggested that the colonisation and successional trajectory of the microinvertebrate assemblage was rapid, perhaps because of the close proximity of potential colonisers.
   Microinvertebrate abundance and mean taxon richness was significantly higher in the River Jubilee (4862 +/- 326 m(-2); 9.7 +/- 0.2) than in the River Thames (1359 +/- 120 m(-2); 7.9 +/- 0.4). The microinvertebrate assemblage that developed in the Jubilee was significantly different (ANOSIM) from that in the Thames and became more distinct over time suggesting that the local habitat template is a crucial determinant of the composition of the microinvertebrate assemblage.
   In this highly connected urban river we show that dispersal is unlikely to be a barrier to microinvertebrate colonisation and that the successional trajectory is rapid suggesting that recovery of microinvertebrate assemblages following effective river restoration should be quick. Longer term (> 3 years) data sets charting the development of ecosystems in new streams are rare, in both pristine and urban environments, and more are needed to verify our conclusions and further elucidate the relative importance of controls on successional trajectories operating at different scales.

AB  - At the time of writing, the Occupy Central Movement (or the 'Umbrella Revolution', as it has become known in the international media) is in full swing in Hong Kong. Spearheaded by two professors and a Baptist minister, it dovetailed with local student movements and quickly expanded into a demonstration encompassing people from different walks of Hong Kong society. This movement was sparked by an electoral reform package imposed on Hong Kong by China, under which the only candidates for the city's Chief Executive would be nominated by a committee likely to be composed of members acceptable to Beijing. The Chinese government insists that the system is a democratic one insofar as Hong Kongers would still be able to choose their leader through 'one person, one vote', but the Movement points out that the committee's screening renders the voting process meaningless. The Movement was galvanised by the local police's use of tear gas against the peaceful protestors, who have called for the repeal of the reform package, the re-opening of the dialogue on Hong Kong's constitutional development, as well as the resignation of the city's current, and highly unpopular, leader.

AB  - Plants that grow epiphytically are often adapted to hold water in a central cup or in leaf axils to maintain hydration given that they cannot access soil water. These bodies of water, called phytotelmata, are miniature temporary aquatic ecosystems. This water frequently contains a variety of microorganisms. The New Zealand native Collospermum hastatum (Colenso) Skottsb. (Asteliaceae) is known to hold water within the leaf axils; however, an assessment of algal communities within this habitat has never been undertaken. To remedy this lack of knowledge, water samples were obtained from the leaf axils of C. hastatum, with exotic bromeliads for comparison. Freycinetia banksii A. Cunn. and Astelia solandri A. Cunn. were also investigated, but did not contain sufficient water for further investigation. Urban bromeliads investigated had a wide range of organisms within the phytotelmata, including four genera of diatoms. No desmids were identified. Collospermum and Forest-sourced bromeliad water held a comparatively less diverse range of biota, with a complete lack of algal presence. We propose three possible explanations for this; inadequate light levels for algal growth; unsuitable phytotelmic pH; and low background levels of algae for dispersal within native forest environments.

AB  - Migration represents the movement of people from one place in the world to another. There are several types of migration: intercontinental, intracontinental and interregional. Today, one of the most significant types of migration is rural to urban migration. The most important push and pull factors which may influence people in movements include environmental, political, economic and cultural factors. Culture is a complex system of behavior, traditions, beliefs, values and artifacts, which is transmitted through generations. It represents a group or community who shares common experiences. Cultural diversity involves the cultural differences that exist among people and the way communities organize themselves, their understanding of morality and religion. It is also called multiculturalism.
   With the accession to the European Union, Croatia faces an interesting set of migration challenges and opportunities. The increase of migration leads to a greater diversity of the population. As people move, their cultural characteristics and ideas spread along with them, creating and changing cultural diversity.
   Area of consideration will be substantiated by survey results, conducted at the College of Slavonski Brod, direction Management. Analysis of the results will show understanding the given terms in relation to students of professional study and students of specialist graduate professional study. The survey aims to answer the question what is the attitude of students towards the existence and preservation of cultural diversity in Croatia because culture is the productive strength of society.

AB  - Mortality is a key factor in understanding the population dynamics of fish. For studies using biotelemetry, missing individuals pose a challenge since the ultimate fate of both the animal and the tag are unknown. In this study, we document three releases of carcasses in a simulated small-scale summer fish kill in a small urban stream using juvenile white sucker (Catostomus commersonii). Passive integrated transponder (PIT) and radio tags were affixed to carcasses that were tracked to determine the fate of both the dead fish and the tags. Mean daily dispersal distances ranged from 0.0 to 7.6 m day(-1) and included downstream and lateral dispersal. Of the 44 radio-tagged carcasses, 26 tags (and presumably carcasses) were consumed by scavengers; the majority were consumed by snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) with fewer carcasses scavenged by great blue heron (Ardea herodias), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). We also contrasted the decomposition rates of in-stream carcasses with those experimentally placed on the riverbank and found that while there was no significant difference in the time to carcass evisceration, the rate of decomposition was more rapid in-stream compared to on-shore. Radio tag loss during the decomposition study was moderate (one of three lost); PIT tag loss occurred when carcasses became eviscerated, typically by invertebrates. By examining the role of scavengers, dispersal and decomposition, it is possible to understand the fate of dead fish, the fate of tags and role of mortality in tagging experiments and the connections between stream and riparian habitats and organisms. This information will help inform the interpretation of potential mortalities in fish tracking studies and improve fish kill investigations.

AB  - With the rapid development of modern cities such as Hong Kong, increasingly more underground facilities and high-rise buildings are being built. Stairs provide important emergency access in these types of structures, especially for upward travel. This study was a controlled experiment on ascending stairs in a typical public housing estate in Hong Kong. The participants were of different age, gender and occupation. Various movement characteristics, including ascent speed, maximum ascending level and changes in blood pressure and heart beat rate before and after the experiment were extracted and analysed. Ascending speed was related to the age of the participants and 95% of participants could ascend to four levels or more. The older participants had relatively greater differences in blood pressure and heart rate before and after the experiment. The study also showed the typical and unique movement characteristics of Hong Kong people. Taken together, the results of this study will be useful for the further development of evacuation models and for enhancing building design in Hong Kong and other Asian cities with similar pedestrian characteristics.

AB  - This article discusses fly-posting practices performed by radical urban activists in Rome and Berlin. It suggests that political posters cannot be understood simply as channels of information about events and activities of political and subcultural autonomous scenes encompassing squats, occupied social centers, political bars, bookshops, cafes, and similar activist hangouts. Rather, these street media are crucially involved in processes of spatial appropriation and in the construction of an antagonistic territoriality. Fly-posting exposes its practitioners to police repression and attacks by right-wing groups, and given the risks involved, it also becomes a form of demarcation, alerting that a certain wall, street, area is symbolically claimed by the movement. Looking at fly-posting we can come to understand the nature of autonomous movement scenes as antagonistic and exclusive spaces, whose internal communitarianism is premised on the symbolic and spatial repulsion of authorities and political enemies.

AB  - This article explores gender differences in the characteristics, spatiality, and capacities of local social networks and their impacts on the employment of recent Mexican immigrants to Los Angeles. After describing the institutional landscape of the regional labor market that new entrants must navigate to find work, I turn to unique and detailed data from a randomized household survey of Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles County. I analyze the role of friends, family members, and neighbors in shaping occupational segregation and hourly earnings of those who migrated to the region during the preceding 5 years. Results suggest that local social networks operate differently for men and women and tend to reinforce differences in mobility and employment. This research contributes both empirically and theoretically to literature on immigrant economic integration by showing how uneven urban labor markets are constituted spatially through gendered networks that connect workers differently to homes, communities, and work places.

AB  - More than 16% of parrot species (Aves Psittaciformes) of the world have currently established at least one breeding population outside their natural distribution ranges. Though including the most introduced bird species all over the world, their interactions with native biodiversity and environments are still poorly known. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge about impacts of introduced Psittaciformes and we identify possible gaps to be filled with future research. Breeding site requirements of alien parrots, e.g. trunk cavities, indicate potential routes of direct and indirect competition with native hole-nesting bird species. Interactions with arboreal rodents, bats and insects are poorly documented, but appear to be limited. Psittaciformes potentially affect economy and human wellness, being responsible for damage to crops and to electrical infrastructures. Association with noise pollution has also been suggested, as many alien populations breed in urban parks or close to human settlements. Psittaciformes are potential reservoirs of Chlamydophila psittaci, the etiological agent of human psittacosis, and other diseases transmittable to humans and wildlife. Less is known about impact on native flora as well as on ecosystem functions. Predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after parrot removal are scarce too, as eradication programs are often hampered by the emotional affiliation linked to these birds.

AB  - Questions
   (1) How do seres differ with respect to vegetation changes? (2) What are the directions of succession? (3) How do species numbers change? (4) How do target species, i.e. those typical of natural and semi-natural vegetation, participate in succession? (5) Are spontaneously developed successional stages acceptable from the point of view of ecosystem restoration?
   Location
   Extracted peatlands, bulldozed sites in forests destroyed by air pollution, an emerged bottom of a water reservoir, corridors of former Iron Curtain, artificial fishpond islands and barriers, sedimentary basins, spoil heaps from mining, stone quarries, forest clearings, road verges, sand and gravel-sand pits, ruderal urban sites, river gravel bars and abandoned arable fields, located in various parts of the Czech Republic in Central Europe.
   Methods
   Phytosociological releves were recorded in 10-25m(2) plots located in the centre of representative successional stages defined by their age, ranging from 1 to 100yrs. In total, we obtained 2392 vegetation samples containing 951 species. We performed DCA ordination to compare 19 seres. Desirable target species were considered as those representing (semi)-natural vegetation and all Red List species.
   Results
   The seres studied are more similar in their species composition in the initial and early stages, in which synathropic species prevail, than in the later stages when the vegetation differentiates. This divergence is driven mainly by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to woodland, which usually established after ca. 20yrs. In very dry or wet places (with limited presence of woody species) open vegetation developed, often highly valuable from the restoration and conservation point of view. The total number of species and the number of target species increased in the majority of seres with successional age.
   Conclusions
   The vegetation in the sites studied formed a continuum along a moisture gradient and by successional age. The individual seres largely overlapped in their species composition; the sere identity was not significant. Spontaneous succession usually proceeded towards woodland, except at very dry or wet sites, and generally appeared to be an ecologically suitable way of ecosystem restoration of disturbed sites because target species became dominant over time.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization estimates that the global number of dengue infections range between 80-100 million per year, with some studies estimating approximately three times higher numbers. Furthermore, the geographic range of dengue virus transmission is extending with the disease now occurring more frequently in areas such as southern Europe. Ae. aegypti, one of the most prominent dengue vectors, is endemic to the far north-east of Australia and the city of Cairns frequently experiences dengue outbreaks which sometimes lead to large epidemics.
   Method: A spatially-explicit, individual-based mathematical model that accounts for the spread of dengue infection as a result of human movement and mosquito dispersion is presented. The model closely couples the four key sub-models necessary for representing the overall dynamics of the physical system, namely those describing mosquito population dynamics, human movement, virus transmission and vector control. Important features are the use of high quality outbreak data and mosquito trapping data for calibration and validation and a strategy to derive local mosquito abundance based on vegetation coverage and census data.
   Results: The model has been calibrated using detailed 2003 dengue outbreak data from Cairns, together with census and mosquito trapping data, and is shown to realistically reproduce a further dengue outbreak. The simulation results replicating the 2008/2009 Cairns epidemic support several hypotheses (formulated previously) aimed at explaining the large-scale epidemic which occurred in 2008/2009; specifically, while warmer weather and increased human movement had only a small effect on the spread of the virus, a shorter virus strain-specific extrinsic incubation time can explain the observed explosive outbreak of 2008/2009.
   Conclusion: The proof-of-concept simulation model described in this study has potential as a tool for understanding factors contributing to dengue spread as well as planning and optimizing dengue control, including reducing the Ae. aegypti vector population and for estimating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of future vaccination programmes. This model could also be applied to other vector borne viral diseases such as chikungunya, also spread by Ae. aegypti and, by re-parameterisation of the vector sub-model, to dengue and chikungunya viruses spread by Aedes albopictus.

TI  - Planning and Architecture in Greece in the Neoliberal Era
T2  - ARCHITECTURE_MPS
LA  - English
AB  - The first decade of the 2000s was an extremely interesting period for Athens which repeatedly captured the world's attention for several reasons. The capital of Greece welcomed the mixed blessing of the Summer Olympic Games of 2004, was faced with major riots during December 2008 and became the focal point of the country's financial crisis; this latter event, igniting extensive protests and demonstrations culminating in the "indignants" movement in the summer of 2011. Today, Athens is experiencing a severe deadlock; neglect and deterioration of the city centre; the establishment of immigrant ghettos; the severing of social fabric; the decomposition of the middle class; the perceived breach of security; and increasing homelessness.
   Over the past decade the tradition established with the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974, of considering the city and its infrastructure as a 'public asset', has been overturned. This was most notable during the preparations for the Summer Olympics between 2000 and 2004 during which a new emergency statutory framework for urban planning was introduced in the name of speed and efficiency. For the first time, public works, state property and enterprises of public interest were privatised. However, the end of the Games did not initiate a return to the former public status quo. On the contrary, the financial crisis that occurred a few years later promoted the 2004 'emergency' model to the position of permanent planning policy. More recently in 2010 and 2011, a series of new laws have been added to this which essentially abolish the state's position of primacy in urban planning decisions, eliminate public consultation at local government level, and reduce environmental and archaeological controls. In short, the private sector has been allowed to establish land-uses that have transgressed previous town planning and environmental norms. At the same time, these laws transfer state land assets to the newly founded Asset Development Fund so as to contribute towards the reduction of the country's international debt. The consequences of this deregulation have been profound.

AB  - Australian Acacia species introduced to South Africa as ornamentals have notably smaller invasive ranges than those introduced for forestry or dune stabilization. We asked whether the relatively small invasive extent of Acacia elata, a species used widely for ornamental purposes, is due to low rates of reproduction. Age at reproductive maturity, seed dispersal, annual seed production, seed bank dynamics and seed germination and viability were assessed at five sites in the Western Cape. Results indicate that A. elata has similar traits to other invasive Australia Acacia species: annual seed input into the leaf litter was high (up to 5000 seeds m(-2)); large seed banks develop (>20,000 seeds m(-2)) in established stands; seed germinability is high (>90%); seeds accumulate mostly in the top soil layers but can infiltrate to depths of 40 cm; and seed germination appears to be stimulated by fire. However the age at the onset of reproduction (similar to 4 years) is longer than most widespread invaders (similar to 3 years) and dispersal is fairly limited (seeds fell up to distances of 6 m from the parent canopy; the highest density of seed rain was found directly under the canopy with over 20% of seeds falling directly under the terminal branches). We suggest that the current limited distribution of invasive A. elata populations is the result of the relatively small size of initial populations (cf. large plantations and widespread plantings for forestry and dune stabilization species), the species' apparent lack of secondary dispersal vectors, and the planting of trees in gardens and urban settings offer limited opportunities for recruitment, proliferation and spread. The species is, however, increasing in abundance and range. We propose methods to improve management of invasions of the species. Management to reduce seed production of this species through classical biological control, as has been achieved for other Australian Acacia species in South Africa, should be prioritised.

AB  - The swarming behaviour of natural populations of Anopheles arabiensis was investigated by conducting transect surveys on 10 consecutive days, around dusk, from March to April and from September to October 2012 in Dioulassoba, a district of Bobo-Dioulasso city in Burkina Faso (West Africa). Swarms were observed outside, around identified larval breeding sites on the banks of the Houet River, as well as in the open-air courtyards found at the centre of many homes in the region. Swarms were found to occur in open sunlit spaces, mostly located above physical or visual cues somehow visually distinct from the surrounding area. Overall 67 and 78 swarms were observed, respectively, during the dry season (March April) and the rainy season (September October) of 2012, between 1.5 m and 4.5 m above the ground at their centre. 964 mosquitoes were collected and analysed from dry season swarms, of which most were male, and all were An. arabiensis, as were the few resting mosquitoes collected indoors. Larvae collected from breeding sites found on the banks of the Houet River mostly consisted of An. arabiensis and only a minority of Anopheles coluzzii (formerly identified as An. gambiae M form). Of 1694 mosquitoes analysed from 78 swarms in the rainy season collections, a few An. gambiae (formerly known as An. gambiae S form) males were identified, and the remainders were An. arabiensis. The majority of larvae collected during the wet season from the same breeding sites were identified as An. arabiensis followed by An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The same pattern of species composition was observed in resting mosquitoes, though the proportion of An. arabiensis was less overwhelming. These data support the conclusion that An. arabiensis is the most prevalent species in this area, though the difference in species composition when using different population sampling techniques is noteworthy. Further studies are required for more detailed investigations of male dispersal, feeding behaviour and mating patterns in this urban setting.

AB  - The Occupy movement has generated a significant amount of scholarly literature, most of which has focused on the movement's tactics or goals, or sought to explain its emergence. Nevertheless, we lack an explanation for the movement's broad appeal and mass support. In this article we present original research on Occupy in New York City, Detroit, and Berlin, which demonstrates that the movement's heterogeneous participants coalesced around the concept of vulnerability. Vulnerability is an inability to adapt to shocks and stresses, and it inhibits social reproduction and prohibits social mobility. Rather than specifically discussing the wealth of elites per se, Occupy participants consistently expressed the feeling that the current political economic system safeguards elites and increases the vulnerability of everyone else. We argue that the Occupy movement has reworked the relationship among a range of political struggles that were hitherto disconnected (i.e. 'old' and 'new' social movements) and rendered them complementary through the politics of vulnerability.

KW  - interfaith

KW  - diversity
KW  - CULTURE
AB  - In a time of increasing religious diversity, interfaith political coalitions have become important settings for interreligious interaction, but little research has explored the types of religious expression that are generated therein. Prevailing theories in the sociology of religion indicate that interaction with religious others results in dilution of traditional religious commitments or production of stronger boundaries. But emerging perspectives in cultural sociology shift attention from individual religious commitments to the ways in which settings shape different styles of religious expression. Insights about edge spaces drawn from urban theory suggest that religiously diverse settings can be generative of new types of religious practices. We apply these insights to the study of interfaith activism by drawing on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with religious advocacy professionals and activists working in interfaith coalitions. Conceptualizing the sites of these interfaith encounters as edge spaces, we analyze variation in the types of religious expression that occur in interfaith settings. We find that both aggregative and integrative practices are produced, but these vary depending on the goals and structure of the setting, as well as participants' accountability to outside religious gatekeepers.

AB  - In the Galapagos Islands human activities such as fisheries and tourism, have boosted the islands' economy at the cost of ecological losses and constant pressures to the fragile insular ecosystems. Hence the evaluation of environmental impacts is essential and requires multiple indicators, appropriate for measuring the state and the interactions of the interrelated social and environmental variables and its relation to ecosystem services. The present research proposes a participatory approach to understand the perception of environmental impacts and its relation to ecosystem services to develop responsive impact mitigation strategies in the Galapagos Islands. The Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) framework provided an analytical lens, while the Delphi method was chosen to involve selected Galapagos experts in the indicator selection process. The Delphi method consists of an iterative set of questionnaire surveys, interspersed with feedback from earlier response rounds. According to our results, 37/55 statistical consent indicators (qi >= 3.5 and Q <= 0.5) and 7/28 relevant interactions of environmental impacts (mean >= 0.5 and CV <= 0.5) explain a cascade of socio-ecological interconnectivity that generates environmental impacts on the Galapagos Islands. Hence, first the socio-economic-cultural and institutional forces (drivers) that include: the increase of tourism and migration, economic growth, continental lifestyles, lack of education and weak management of institutions. These drivers place stress on the environment (pressures). The pressures include: the importation of goods, land clearing for agriculture/abandonment and urban zone extension. Subsequently, these pressures generate changes in the environmental functions (impacts). The identification of impacts and their interactions indicate a close relationship between eight impacts in Galapagos: introduction of species, biodiversity loss, land use change, loss of biological resources, habitat fragmentation, landscape alterations, water basin overexploitation and decrease of water quality. Lastly, scientifically sound solutions and alternatives to deal with the Galapagos' social, economical, political, managerial and technical problems are also provided (responses). This study is an applicable useful systemic reference for Galapagos' decision makers to deliver policies in order to move towards proper conservation management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Riparian forests adjacent to surface water are important transitional zones which maintain and enrich biodiversity and ensure the sustainability in a forest ecosystem. Also, riparian forests maintain water quality, reduce sediment delivery, enhance habitat areas for aquatic life and wildlife, and provide ecological corridors between the upland and the downstream. However, the riparian ecosystems have been degraded mainly due to human development, forest operations, and agricultural activities. In order to evaluate the impacts of these factors on riparian forests, it is necessary to estimate trends in forest cover changes. This study aims to analyze riparian forest cover changes along the Firniz River located in Mediterranean city of Kahramanmaras in Turkey. Changes in riparian forest cover from 1989 to 2010 have been determined by implementing supervised classification method on a series of Landsat TM imagery of the study area. The results indicated that the classification process applied on 1989 and 2010 images provided overall accuracy of 80.08 and 75%, respectively. It was found that the most common land use class within the riparian zone was productive forest, followed by degraded forest, agricultural areas, and other land use classes. The results also indicated that the areas of degraded forest and forest openings increased, while productive forest and agricultural areas decreased between the years of 1989 and 2010. The amount of agricultural areas decreased due to the reduction in the population of rural people. According to these results, it can be concluded that special forest management and operation techniques should be implemented to restore the forest ecosystem in riparian areas.

AB  - Peri-urban infestations with triatomine bugs, their sources and their dynamics have rarely been investigated. Here, we corroborated the reported occurrence of Triatoma infestans in a peri-urban area and in neighbouring rural houses in Pampa del Indio, in the Argentine Chaco, and identified its putative sources using spatial analysis and demographic questionnaires. Peri-urban householders reported that 10% of their premises had triatomines, whereas T. infestans was collected by timed manual searches or community-based surveillance in only nine (3%) houses. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected T. infestans and Triatoma sordida were collected indoors only in peri-urban houses and were infected with TcV and TcI, respectively. The triatomines fed on chickens, cats and humans. Periurban infestations were most frequent in a squatter settlement and particularly within the recently built mud houses of rural immigrants, with large-sized households, more dogs and cats and more crowding. Several of the observed infestations were most likely associated with passive bug transport from other sources and with active bug dispersal from neighbouring foci. Thus, the households in the squatter settlement were at a greater risk of bug invasion and colonisation. In sum, the incipient process of domestic colonisation and transmission, along with persistent rural-to-urban migratory flows and unplanned urbanisation, indicate the need for active vector surveillance and control actions at the peri-urban interface of the Gran Chaco.

AB  - 1: This study investigated 15 coexisting dominant species in a humid subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwest China, consisting of long-lived pioneers and climax species occurring in natural and disturbed regimes. The authors hypothesized that there would be non-tradeoff scaling relationships between sprouting and seed size among species, with the aim of uncovering the ecological relationship between plant sprouting and seed characteristics in the two functional groups.
   2: The sprouting variations of the species were initially examined using pairwise comparisons between natural and disturbed habitats within and across species and were noted to show a continuum in persistence niches across the forest dominants, which may underlie the maintenance of plant diversity. Second, a significantly positive, rather than tradeoff, relationship between sprout number and seed size across species within each of the two functional groups was observed, and an obvious elevational shift with a common slope among the two groups in their natural habitat was examined. The results indicate the following: 1) the relationship of seed size vs. sprouts in the natural habitat is more likely to be bet-hedging among species within a guild in a forest; 2) climax species tend to choose seeding rather than sprouting regeneration, and vice versa for the long-lived pioneers; and 3) the negative correlation between sprouting and seed dispersal under disturbed conditions may imply a tradeoff between dispersal and persistence in situ during the process of plant regeneration.
   3: These findings may be of potential significance for urban greening using native species.

AB  - Nowadays movement patterns and people's behavioral models are needed for traffic engineers and city planners. These observations could be used to reason about mobility and its sustainability and to support decision makers with reliable information. The very same knowledge about human diaspora and behavior extracted from these data is also valuable to the urban planner, so as to localize new services, organize logistics systems and to detect changes as they occur in the movement behavior. Moreover, it is interesting to investigate movement in places like a shopping area or a working district either for commercial purposes or for improving the service quality. These kinds of tracking data are made available by wireless and mobile communication technologies. It is now possible to record and collect a large amount of mobile phone calls in a city. Technologies for object tracking have recently become affordable and reliable and hence we were able to collect mobile phone data from a city in China from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. The large amount of phone call records from mobile operators can be considered as life mates and sensors of persons to inform howmany people are present in any given area and how many are entering or leaving. Each phone call record usually contains the caller and callee IDs, date and time, and the base station where the phone calls are made. As mobile phones are widely used in our daily life, many human behaviors can be revealed by analyzing mobile phone data. Through mobile phones, we can learn the information about locations, communications between mobile phone users during their daily lives. In this work, we propose a comprehensive visual analysis system named as MViewer, Mobile phone spatiotemporal data Viewer, which is the first system to visualize and analyze the population'smobility patterns from millions of phone call records. Our system consists of three major components: 1) visual analysis of user groups in a base station; 2) visual analysis of the mobility patterns on different user groups making phone calls in certain base stations; 3) visual analysis of handoff phone call records. Some well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and pixelbased representations have been integrated into our system. We also develop a novel visualization schemes, Voronoidiagram-based visual encoding to reveal the unique features of mobile phone data. We have applied our system to real mobile phone datasets that are kindly provided by our project partners and obtained some interesting findings regarding people's mobility patterns.

AB  - The City of Wadsworth, Ohio, is upgrading and adding new capabilities to its protection and control (P&C) system. A cohesive set of ground-breaking new technologies is being deployed, leveraging an existing fiber-optic communications network. The integration of modern recloser controls, capacitors, regulators, and feeder circuits with a centralized automated fault detection, isolation, and restoration system is the focus of the new P&C system. In addition, the new P&C design provides a solution to a present challenge: engineering a centralized automated feeder voltage profile optimization solution that can remain fully functional alongside a fault detection and isolation system that is capable of automatically modifying the distribution system topology. The problem with many existing automated voltage profile optimization solutions is that they may need to be disabled when a distribution feeder is not in its normal configuration. These two technologies are being integrated into a single interdependent solution that provides the city with a volt/VAR control system that can automatically and appropriately adapt to constantly changing distribution system topology as faults, loss of potential, miscoordinations, or overloads occur and are automatically and immediately mitigated.

AB  - Theileria orientalis is a causative agent of benign theileriosis in cattle and distributed in mainly Asian countries. In the present study, we examined the prevalence of T. orientalis infection by PCR based on the major piroplasm surface protein gene (MPSP) sequences in cattle in Myanmar, followed by phylogenetic analysis of the MPSP genes. The MPSP gene was amplified in 258 of 713 (36.2%) cattle blood DNA samples collected from five cities in different geographical regions of Myanmar. Phylogenetic analysis of MPSP sequences from 54 T. orientalis-positive DNA samples revealed the presence of six allelic genotypes, including Types 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and N-3. Types 5 and 7 were the predominant types detected. Sequences of the MPSP genes detected in Myanmar were closely related to those from Thailand, Vietnam or Mongolia. These findings suggest that movement of animals carrying T. orientalis parasites between Southeast Asian countries could be a reason for the similar genotype distribution of the parasites in Myanmar.

AB  - The Atlantic invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/P. miles) has been as swift as it has been disastrous. Lionfish are non-native to the Mediterranean, but an invasion is perhaps even more likely than for the Atlantic. First, as for the Atlantic, there are many major cities on the coast of the Mediterranean (where aquarium-keeping is a common practice and chances of accidental and deliberate releases are high), and second, lionfish are native to the Red Sea, to which the Mediterranean is connected via the Suez Canal. Furthermore, there have already been four records of lionfish in the Mediterranean and so the pretext for an invasion is already in place. Up until now, however, it has been difficult to gauge the likelihood of an infestation of lionfish in the Mediterranean as, unlike the Atlantic, this sea has not been examined in terms of its hydrodynamics, ocean climate, and bathymetry, all factors known to be relevant to assessing the possibility of invasion. Motivated by this knowledge-gap, this study used remote sensing and computer modeling to investigate the connectivity between areas along the Mediterranean coastline that fulfill the necessary physical criteria to serve as potential lionfish habitat. Model results from the Mediterranean were compared and contrasted to those from the Atlantic and eastern Pacific. The Atlantic was considered because the lionfish invasion there has been voracious. Meanwhile, the eastern Pacific is interesting as a site without native lionfish, but with plenty of opportunity for their introduction, but no invasion yet recorded. Results indicated that, unlike in the Atlantic, connectivity among potential lionfish habitats in the Mediterranean was low in the study and comparable to that in the eastern Pacific. Although oceanographic conditions in the Mediterranean were found unfavorable for wide dispersion of lionfish larvae, hotspots where numerous lionfish sightings would forewarn an impending invasion were identified. This paper can therefore serve as a guide to the most efficient monitoring of lionfish in the Mediterranean and to where removal efforts should be concentrated, should the species become established.

AB  - Space does not occur only as a physical structure, also occurs with human activity, such as the occurrence of public spaces. They find meaning with human activities beside their definition by boundaries and design. The emergence of public spaces by human activity also helps to reach to a level of political human identity from the level of being human. In this study, spatial footprints of this mutual existence are read through social movements.
   Urban spaces are not considered only with their physical features but also meanings of social, sociological, psychological, as a whole. With different points of view, it is seen that public spaces devolve their situations and functions to private spaces in intensive ways. Changing relationship between the usage of public and private spaces is getting interests of researchers who studied on the evolution of the modern society. These researches have mainly two focus points. First indicates that there is a relationship between changing usage of public spaces intensively, and the appearance of living rooms instead of squares and streets as public spaces, which bring along to zoom in on personality problems by individuals. Second focus point examines conditions of people over their encouragement that occurs in order to explain their feelings to others. Recent social movements can give a perspective with an understanding to these conditions. The conditions that are comprised by social movements emphasize the importance of public spaces in cities and on social life, together with the right to the city, which on the other hand gave a rise to social movements. Therefore, it can be said that the lack of public space makes mutual relationship/communication between people and groups widely pointless.
   This study aims to analyze social structure - public space relationship and utilization of square as a public space. Perception of square within the society, its importance and essentiality in urban texture, its physical and symbolic features, its analysis as a sustainable living environment will be the main areas to be covered within this context. The study will be concluded by the analysis of the recent transformation of Istanbul Taksim Cumhuriyet Square and the reflection of Gezi Protest to this transformation.

AB  - Forest fragmentation threatens the reproduction of tree species, for which habitats overlap with urban and rural areas. An endangered maple, Acer miyabei f. miyabei, is such a species in northern Japan. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation on seed production and mate diversity and assessed gene flow within and between fragmented forests. We measured the density, viability, and kinship of seeds dispersed around 82 target trees in 21 fragmented forests in rural and urban areas. The dispersed seed density decreased as the size of the target trees and the number of adult trees in each forest decreased. The viable seed proportion also decreased as the number of adult trees in each forest decreased. We did not find any effects on the kinship co-efficient among seeds dispersed around each target tree. The regression line of the pairwise kinship co-efficient of the seeds against the distance had a higher intercept and a more gently declining slope between the forests than within the forests, indicating forest fragmentation altered gene flow patterns. The results suggest reduced seed production due to pollen limitation and changes in the genetic structure of regenerating populations of A. miyabei in fragmented forests.

AB  - Soon after the establishment of Occupy Wall Street in September 2011, various groups initiated projects to collect and manage records of the movement. This article focuses on two community archives which were established by participants in Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Philadelphia, two formal archives institutions which have collected material and worked to build a relationship between the Occupy movement - the Tamiment Library & Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives in New York and the Temple University Urban Archives in Philadelphia - and the Activist Archivists group in New York who have provided advice and assistance to records creators and records collectors in the Occupy movement. The article investigates the ways in which these projects have incorporated the ethos and organizing strategies of the Occupy movement into their work, particularly by focusing on enabling wide participation in the management of records and by working to break down hierarchical relationships between professional archivists and non-professional users of archives.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the relevance of basic education (MEB), in the municipality of Itacoatiara-AM, in the period from 1998 to 2003. In view of the political-pedagogic character of educational practices forged by this movement during its 3rd stage at national level. The movement of basic education was created in 1961 by the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB). The main goal of the MEB was to develop a programme of basic education, through broadcasting schools, mostly in rural areas of underdeveloped areas of North, Northeast and Center-West of the country, expanding later to other regions of Brazil in accordance with Decree 5.2267V61. So, was the analysis on primary sources (documents) that are located in the city's Prelatic Curia. And also in the bibliographic survey therefore it is practically impossible to develop a scientific study, without justification in one or more assumptions that target the "reconstruction" of the object. Despite the diversity of information contained in the documents, are still scarce studies that aim to historicize the MEB in the northern region of the country. The research data show that, during the performance of the MEB in Itacoatiara radio was the main means of transmission of classes, teachers used booklets prepared by the MEB in accordance with the local reality.

Unlike prior works that demonstrate traffic jam through vehicle detection only, this paper attempts to introduce a new fuzzy-based method for modeling traffic congestion levels that consider both the road occupancy levels as well as vehicle movement. Our model has an advantage of describing the traffic condition more precisely. We have performed a simulation of the proposed model using Matlab Fuzzy Toolbox and the preliminary results reveal that the proposed model is promising.

My data are drawn from the photographs I took of these signs at the Park and the near vicinity, a YouTube video of a protest sign, a blog commenting on this sign, and a political cartoon using the same image featured on two other signs. I explore how social actors drew upon and mediated specific discourses in their protest signs that became transportable across time and space, the role of these signs in transforming public space, and this linguistic landscape's ensuing mobilities in its mediated relocations to online social media sites and blogs.

TI  - ENCAMPMENTS: Spatial Taxonomies of Sri Lanka's Civil War
T2  - ARCHITECTURAL THEORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The escalation of human displacements occurring during the twenty-first century has seen the emergence of humanitarian relief accommodation as a new architectural type worthy of close analysis. Yet, these isolated physical phenomena and related design interventions alone are inadequate for theorising spatial violence. This paper broadens the analysis of camps to encompass notions of encampment related to war, militarisation, and urban security, using dispossession, eviction, and refugee movement as its empirical lens. Focusing on two examples from Colombo, Sri Lanka, where the spatial violence of radical human displacement is domesticated as everyday urban phenomena, this paper links the wartime emergence of camp environments, of temporal urban spaces, and the militarisation of the public sphere to economic liberalisation and political change.

AB  - Individuals and other entities move through space as a function of local characteristics of place, their internal behavioral models, and the topological structure of the underlying space. When a collection of locations (i.e. geotagged photos or other geotagged social media information) from a large number of individuals is assembled, it becomes possible to understand the interrelationship between the individuals and the space they occupy. This research systematically considers this interrelationship through an examination of the effect of the intersection of behavioral and spatial characteristics on individuals moving on street networks. The research illustrates how social media data, in combination with a biased random walker, can be used to understand and model the interaction of spatial structure and social-environmental factors on influencing individuals' use of their environment. The biased walker offers a flexible approach to incorporate consideration of both social-environmental and structural factors into a model and we demonstrate this through a case study wherein we are able to use the random walker to model the characteristics of Flickr users in New York City.

AB  - As used by Occupy Wall Street, the human microphone played a central role in the formation of an auditory space that was animated by the principles of direct democracy that guided the movement. However, the practice also allowed the occupiers to confront and subvert the monopoly on amplified public speech that the government of the City of New York had possessed for nearly eighty years. This paper presents a brief history and analysis of the city's regulation of sound devices, locating the human microphone in a larger struggle over the rights to public speech and assembly.

AB  - Ghardaia, central Algeria, experienced a major outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in 2005. Two Leishmania species occur in this region: Leishmania major (MON-25) and Leishmania killicki (MON-301). The two species are transmitted respectively by the sandflies Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus sergenti and probably involve rodent reservoirs with different ecologies, suggesting distinct epidemiological patterns and distribution areas.
   The aims of this study were to establish risk maps for each Leishmania species in Ghardaia, taking into account the specificities of their vectors and reservoirs biotopes, using land cover and topographical characteristics derived from remote sensing imagery. Using expert and bibliographic knowledge, habitats of vectors and reservoirs were mapped. Hazard maps, defined as areas of presence of both vectors and reservoirs, were then combined with vulnerability maps, defined as areas with human presence, to map the risk of CL occurrence due to each species. The vector habitat maps and risk maps were validated using available entomological data and epidemiological data.
   The results showed that remote sensing analysis can be used to map and differentiate risk areas for the two species causing CL and identify palm groves and areas bordering the river crossing the city as areas at risk of CL due to L. major, whereas more limited rocky hills on the outskirts of the city are identified as areas at risk of CL due to L. killicki.
   In the current context of urban development in Ghardaia, this study provides useful information for the local authorities on the respective risk areas for CL caused by both parasites, in order to take prevention and control measures to prevent future CL outbreaks.

AB  - Any attempt to map in Turkish historiography the presence of Salonica as a predominantly Jewish Ottoman city is bound to end in frustration due to a general lack of interest in the topic. This is strange if one considers that during the last decades of the empire, Salonica was by far its most active city after Istanbul, which was an unrivaled center of cultural, political, economic, and social modernity. The present situation stems from the reduction of Salonica to the status of a city lost to the Greeks, a vision that further occults the Jewish dimension of its identity and destiny. As such, there is little that connects the history of the city to mainstream Turkish history, other than the fact that it was the birthplace of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Turkish historiography has stripped Salonica of its historical identity and reality to turn it into yet another "Turkish" city lost during the debacle of the end of the empire. The steamroller of national(ist) history has thus flattened the city's complex and multilayered past into the grand narrative of the Ottoman Empire as a Turco-Islamic state. Apart from translations of the few Western sources that tell a different story, Turkish historical studies have failed to produce any original work on the subject; even worse, some of the rare works that do exist tend to concentrate on a pseudohistorical and populist account of the Sabbatean community as (yet another) fifth column targeting the integrity of country and nation.

AB  - Introduction of the large-statured, invasive grass Arundo donax has negatively affected riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean-type climates and tropical regions worldwide. Control programs in large watersheds have been largely ineffective in reducing populations because of Arundo's ability to recolonize after flooding and human induced changes to resource availability that facilitates growth. In a greenhouse study, we evaluated the relative effects of nitrogen, soil type, soil moisture, and light availability on Arundo growth. All treatments significantly influenced plant growth, but nitrogen addition and soils with organic materials had the strongest positive effect on above- and belowground biomass production. Ratios of above- to belowground growth were relatively stable across soil types and moisture levels, but allocation to belowground structures was significantly increased by nitrogen addition and full sunlight. Our results imply that control and management programs should address the human-altered nutrient and soil conditions associated with agricultural and urban watersheds that may facilitate dispersal, establishment, and growth of Arundo and other invasive plants.

AB  - Dengue is a re-emergent vector-borne disease affecting large portions of the world's population living in the tropics and subtropics. The virus is transmitted through the bites of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and it is widely believed that these bites occur primarily in the daytime. The transmission of dengue is a complicated process, and one of the main sources of this complexity is due to the movement of people, e.g. between home and their places of work. Hence, the mechanics of disease progression may also differ between day and night. A discrete-time multi-patch dengue transmission model which takes into account the mobility of people as well as processes of infection, recovery, recruitment, mortality, and outbound and return movements is considered here. One patch (the city) is connected to all other patches (the villages) in a spoke-like network. We obtain here the basic reproductive ratio (a">(0)) of the transmission model which represents a threshold for an epidemic to occur. Dynamical analysis for vector control, human treatment and vaccination, and different kinds of mobility are performed. It is shown that changes in human movement patterns can, in some situations, affect the ability of the disease to persist in a predictable manner. We conclude with biological implications for the prevention and control of dengue virus transmission.

AB  - Popocatepetl is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes threatening a densely populated area that includes Mexico City with more than 20 million inhabitants. The destructive potential of this volcano is demonstrated by its Late Pleistocene-Holocene eruptive activity, which has been characterized by recurrent Plinian eruptions of large magnitude, the last two of which destroyed human settlements in pre-Hispanic times. Popocatepetl's reawakening in 1994 produced a crisis that culminated with the evacuation of two villages on the northeastern flank of the volcano. Shortly after, a monitoring system and a civil protection contingency plan based on a hazard zone map were implemented. The current volcanic hazards map considers the potential occurrence of different volcanic phenomena, including pyroclastic density currents and lahars. However, no quantitative assessment of the tephra hazard, especially related to atmospheric dispersal, has been performed. The presence of airborne volcanic ash at low and jet-cruise atmospheric levels compromises the safety of aircraft operations and forces re-routing of aircraft to prevent encounters with volcanic ash clouds. Given the high number of important airports in the surroundings of Popocatepetl volcano and considering the potential threat posed to civil aviation in Mexico and adjacent regions in case of a Plinian eruption, a hazard assessment for tephra dispersal is required. In this work, we present the first probabilistic tephra dispersal hazard assessment for Popocatepetl volcano. We compute probabilistic hazard maps for critical thresholds of airborne ash concentrations at different flight levels, corresponding to the situation defined in Europe during 2010, and still under discussion. Tephra dispersal mode is performed using the FALL3D numerical model. Probabilistic hazard maps are built for a Plinian eruptive scenario defined on the basis of geological field data for the "Ochre Pumice" Plinian eruption (4965 C-14 yr BP). FALL3D model input eruptive parameters are constrained through an inversion method carried out with the semi-analytical HAZMAP model and are varied by sampling them using probability density functions. We analyze the influence of seasonal variations on ash dispersal and estimate the average persistence of critical ash concentrations at relevant locations and airports. This study assesses the impact that a Plinian eruption similar to the Ochre Pumice eruption would have on the main airports of Mexico and adjacent areas. The hazard maps presented here can support long-term planning that would help minimize the impacts of such an eruption on civil aviation.

AB  - To gain more precise information about molecular genetic variation for wild populations of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici from Qinghai Province, China, 38 single-colony isolates were purified from samples collected from Haidong District, Xining City and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in 2010. The virulence of 21 isolates among them was tested at seedling stage on 34 wheat cultivars (lines) carrying known powdery mildew (Pm) resistant genes. The results showed that V1a,V3a,V3c,V3e,V5a, V6, V7, V8 and V19 had high virulence frequencies (>75%), indicating a wide distribution; and V1c, V5b, V12, V13, V16, V21, VXBD, V2+6, V2+Mld and V4+8, with less distribution, appeared to be lower in frequencies (0-20%). The Nei's gene diversity (H), Shannon's information index (1) and the percentage of polymorphic loci (P) were 0.23, 0.35 and 67.65%, respectively, which revealed a virulent diversity. The results from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 38 isolates showed that three housekeeping genes were found to contain a total of 9 SNP sites. 10 haplotypes (H1-H10) were inferred from the concatenated sequences, with 1 haplotype (H1) comprising of over 55% of Qinghai population. Phylogenic analysis did not show obvious geographical subdivision between the isolates. A multilocus haplotype network presented a radial structure, with H1 in the central as an inferred ancestor. Using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), we found 1.63% of the total variation was among populations and 98.37% within populations, with a low fixations index (F-ST=0.01634, P<0.05). This revealed a relatively high genetic diversity but a low genetic divergence in Qinghai population. Moreover, the molecular data on gene flow (Nm=6.32) confirmed the migration of pathogen populations among areas in Qinghai Province.

AB  - The number and demographic history of colonists can have dramatic consequences for the way in which genetic diversity is distributed and maintained in a metapopulation. The bed bug (Cimex lectularius) is a re-emerging pest species whose close association with humans has led to frequent local extinction and colonization, that is, to metapopulation dynamics. Pest control limits the lifespan of subpopulations, causing frequent local extinctions, and human-facilitated dispersal allows the colonization of empty patches. Founder events often result in drastic reductions in diversity and an increased influence of genetic drift. Coupled with restricted migration, this can lead to rapid population differentiation. We therefore predicted strong population structuring. Here, using 21 newly characterized microsatellite markers and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we investigate simplified versions of two classical models of metapopulation dynamics, in a coalescent framework, to estimate the number and genetic composition of founders in the common bed bug. We found very limited diversity within infestations but high degrees of structuring across the city of London, with extreme levels of genetic differentiation between infestations (F-ST=0.59). ABC results suggest a common origin of all founders of a given subpopulation and that the numbers of colonists were low, implying that even a single mated female is enough to found a new infestation successfully. These patterns of colonization are close to the predictions of the propagule pool model, where all founders originate from the same parental infestation. These results show that aspects of metapopulation dynamics can be captured in simple models and provide insights that are valuable for the future targeted control of bed bug infestations.

AB  - Analyzing oppositional social movements in the context of municipal immigration ordinances, the authors examine whether the explanatory power of resource mobilization, political process, and strain theories of social movements' impact on policy outcomes differs when considering proactive as opposed to reactive movements. The adoption of pro-immigrant (proactive) ordinances was facilitated by the presence of immigrant community organizations and of sympathetic local political allies. The adoption of anti-immigrant (reactive) ordinances was influenced by structural social changes, such as rapid increases in the local Latino population, that were framed as threats. The study also finds that pro-immigrant protest events can influence policy in two ways, contributing both to the passage of pro-immigrant ordinances in the locality where protests occur and also inhibiting the passage of anti-immigrant ordinances in neighboring cities.

AB  - The appearance of Occupy in the winter of 2011 in city after city around the world demonstrated the rise of discontent in a world of globalized capital, consumerism and wealth accumulation by - as Occupy put it the 1 percent. Occupy followed a succession of anticapitalist and antiglobalization protests since that in Seattle in 1999, and anti-roads protests before that. Perhaps the tactic of occupation has deeper roots, too, in a taking over of the means of producing society (as in antifascist factory occupations in France in the 1930s). Given this expanded field of political action outside institutional structures, are there dissident tendencies within architecture now that architecture, too, occupies an expanded field of cultural production? Occupy challenges the system through its use of direct democracy, but are there ways in which architecture can contribute to such a movement or is the profession tied to institutional validation and the wealth of its clientele? I begin by setting out two contexts for the enquiry: the architectural everyday of the 1990s as an expansion of architecture's field; and the earlier model of an expanded field, introduced in art history in the 1970s, which uses the prefix "not-" to align a practice to adjacent fields. I ask how to read Occupy, and then question the relevance of architecture to anticapitalism and the democratic deficit. I argue that architecture needs to ask again how it contributes to social and political life, observing that while Occupy occupied spaces it had no need for building design. At the same time, there are practices - such as Elemental in Chile - which genuinely coproduce new sociocultural models of urban habitat.

AB  - Bio-invasions occur in management mosaics where local control affects spread and damage across political boundaries. We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seasonal distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at the air-soil intersection was determined for two regions: one with urban characteristics where traffic is dense (BUTAL) and the other representing the coastal zone (Mudanya). Fifty-one air and soil samples were simultaneously collected. Total PCB (I (82) pound PCB) levels in the soil samples collected during a 1-year period ranged between 105 and 7,060 pg/g dry matter (dm) (BUTAL) and 110 and 2,320 pg/g dm (Mudanya). Total PCB levels in the gaseous phase were measured to be between 100 and 910 pg/m(3) (BUTAL) and 75 and 1,025 pg/m(3) (Mudanya). Variations in the concentrations were observed depending on the season. Though the PCB concentrations measured in the atmospheres of both regions in the summer months were high, they were found to be lower in winter. However, while soil PCB levels were measured to be high at BUTAL during summer months, they were found to be high during winter months in Mudanya. The direction and amount of the PCB movement were determined by calculating the gaseous phase change fluxes at air-soil intersection. While a general PCB movement from soil to air was found for BUTAL, the PCB movement from air to soil was calculated for the Mudanya region in most of the sampling events. During the warmer seasons PCB movement towards the atmosphere was observed due to evaporation from the soil. With decreases in the temperature, both decreases in the number of PCB congeners occurring in the air and a change in the direction of some congeners were observed, possibly caused by deposition from the atmosphere to the soil. 3-CB and 4-CB congeners were found to be dominant in the atmosphere, and 4-, 5-, and 6-CBs were found to dominate in the surface soils.

AB  - Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) or the Asian subterranean termite is a serious structural pest in urban settlements in Southeast Asia that has been introduced to other parts of the world through human commerce. Although mitochondrial DNA markers were previously used to shed light on the dispersal history of the Asian subterranean termite, there were limited attempts to analyze or include populations of the termite found in the wild in Southeast Asia. In this study, we analyzed the 16S ribosomal RNA(16S rRNA) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes of Asian subterranean termite colonies found in mangrove swamps, beach forests, plantations, and buildings in semi-urban and urban areas to determine the relationship between colonies found in the wild and the urban habitat, and to investigate the possibility of different ecotypes of the termite in Peninsular Malaysia. Our findings show that the 16S rRNA haplotypes recovered from this study clustered into eastern, western, and southern populations of the termite, while the cox1 haplotypes were often specific to an area or site. The 16S rRNA and cox1 genes or haplotypes showed that the most abundant haplotype occupied a wide range of environments or habitats. In addition, the cox1 tree showed evidence of historical biogeography where basal haplotypes inhabited a wide range of habitats, while apical haplotypes were restricted to mangrove swamps and beach forests. Information on the haplotype-habitat association of C. gestroi will enable the prediction of habitats that may harbor or be at risk of invasion in areas where they have been introduced.

AB  - Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.

AB  - Two devastating earthquakes with moment magnitudes of 7.2 and 5.6 occurred on October 23, 2011 (Van-ErciAY earthquake) and November 9, 2011 (Van-Edremit earthquake), respectively, in the Van Province of the eastern Turkey. The Van-ErciAY and Van-Edremit earthquakes caused 604 and 38 fatalities, respectively, and heavy damage to buildings and other structures, particularly in ErciAY town and Van City. In this study, characteristics of both main shocks and their geotechnical aspects, such as local site conditions, liquefaction phenomena and associated ground deformations and slope failures are evaluated. The failures of slopes and embankments and rock falls and ground liquefaction may also be indications of diluted ground deformation caused by the earthquake fault. It seems that a wedge-like body bounded by two fault planes was uplifted. As a result of this movement, the northern shoreline of Van Lake uplifted. The November 9, 2011 Van-Edremit earthquake was triggered due to the variation of crustal stresses induced by the October 23, 2011 earthquake. The effects of local site conditions have contributed to the damage of some parts of ErciAY city and its vicinity; however, the ground liquefaction was not observed in the city as anticipated. With a magnitude of 5.6, the Van-Edremit earthquake is probably the smallest magnitude earthquake to cause liquefaction in Turkey so far.

AB  - This paper introduces a GNSS processing algorithm called simultaneous position estimation and ambiguity resolution (SPEAR), with the goal of delivering high-accuracy, high-integrity navigation with robustness to carrier-tracking interruptions. The algorithm operates by continuously applying integer constraints to estimate the navigation solution recursively as a histogram of possible state values. The proposed approach is distinctive in that it decomposes the carrier-wave measurement into two components: an apparent integer difference, used for Bayesian prediction, and a fractional phase, used for Bayesian correction. The algorithm has potential application for high-accuracy, high-integrity safety of life operations near buildings or other obstructions of the sky, as may occur during aircraft surface movement or automobile navigation in urban canyons.

AB  - Alluvial and colluvial sequences were studied around the prehistoric tell Arslantepe in 11 exposures and additional auger cores. The chronology is based on 11 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, four radiocarbon ages, and the embedded artifacts. Sediments contained wood charcoals, providing information on former vegetation. Fluvial activity is documented during Late Glacial times (15.4 +/- 2.5, 12.8 +/- 3.1kyr) and frequently after Roman times. Slope and soil erosion occurred in the early (10.6 +/- 1.4, 8.2 +/- 0.7kyr) and mid-late Holocene (6.7 +/- 0.9, 5.4 +/- 0.7-4.7 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.2-2.5 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2-1.8 +/- 0.2kyr, and during the last 1000 years). The early Holocene erosion phases pre-date the so far established onset of settlement at the tell. This either indicates an earlier onset of agricultural land use than assumed or climatic influence on erosion, such as the 10.3 and 8.2kyr climate events known from Western Europe. The erosion phases at around 5.0 and 2.6kyr could reflect geomorphic responses to societal collapse (Late Chalcolithic state, Neo-Hittite kingdom) at Arslantepe. Most intensive Holocene soil erosion and landscape degradation occurred after occupation of the region by the Roman Empire. This is paralleled by the onset of river activity. A part of the lower neo-Hittite town as well as an early Holocene Terra Rossa-like soil that had formed rapidly were found buried. So far, no indication for mid-late Holocene fluvial activity of the adjacent creeks until Roman times has been found. Our results illustrate the large potential of slope deposits for long term reconstructions of human induced landscape transformation in Anatolia.

AB  - To compensate for its eye's inability to point its eye at a target, the fly's eye consists of multiple angularly spaced sensors giving the fly the wide-area visual coverage it needs to detect and avoid the threats around him. Based on a similar concept a revolutionary new micro-radar sensor technology is proposed for detecting and tracking ground and/or airborne low profile low altitude targets in harsh urban environments. Distributed along a border or around a protected object (military facility and buildings, camp, stadium) small size, low power unattended radar sensors can be used for target detection and tracking, threat warning, pre-shot sniper protection and provides effective support for homeland security. In addition it can provide 3D recognition and targets classification due to its use of five orders more pulses than any scanning radar to each space point, by using few points of view, diversity signals and intelligent processing.
   The application of an array of directional antennas eliminates the need for a mechanical scanning antenna or phase processor. It radically decreases radar size and increases bearing accuracy several folds. The proposed micro-radar sensors can be easy connected to one or several operators by point-to-point invisible protected communication. The directional antennas have higher gain, can be multi-frequency and connected to a multi-functional network. Fly eye micro-radars are inexpensive, can be expendable and will reduce cost of defense.

AB  - The struggle for social rights, beyond the scope of the work, gave the keynote to the popular unrest that intensified in Chile from the fifties onwards. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a key aspect of these actions, which are part of the process of formation of the Chilean urban working class, consisting in the occupation of urban space. The mobilization was organized through direct action of the workers in the struggle for habitation. Another purpose is to demonstrate that these actions were vital to forge their collective identity, as well as to expand the political debate about the impacts of the capitalist structure on the workers living conditions. Such struggles, waged by the conquest of basic rights, contributed to a greater democratization of Chilean society.

AB  - Food availability can impact group formation in Carnivora. Specifically, it has been suggested that temporal variation in food availability may allow a breeding pair to tolerate additional adults in their territory at times when food abundance is high. We investigate group occurrence and intraspecific tolerance during breeding in a socially flexible canid, the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus). We compare Iceland and Sweden where resource conditions differ considerably. A breeding pair was the most common social unit in both populations, but as predicted, groups were more frequent where food abundance varied substantially between years (Sweden: 6 %) than where food availability was stable (Iceland: a parts per thousand currency sign2 %). Within Sweden, supplemental feeding increased group occurrence from 6 to 21 %, but there was no effect of natural variation in lemming (Lemmus lemmus) availability since group formation was rare also at lemming highs. Thus, additional factors appeared to influence the trade-off between intraspecific territoriality and tolerance. We report two cases where related females showed enduring social relationships with good-neighbour strategies. Related females also engaged in alloparental behaviour in a 'fox town' with 31 foxes (4 adults, 3 litters). In contrast, when unrelated foxes bred close to each other, they moved or split their litters during summer, presumably because of territorial conflict. We suggest that fluctuating food availability is linked to group formation in this Arctic carnivore, but also when food availability increases, additional factors such as relatedness, alloparental benefits, competition and predator defence appear necessary to explain group formation.

AB  - Migration is a major challenge of many European member states, early preparedness is imperative for target states for multiple reasons such as provision of adequate search and rescue measures. Specific events such as natural disasters might be in some cases the reason for increased communication by the crowd as well as early indicators of developing migration flows. In order to identify such indicators, we investigated the daily number of geo referenced Tweets in Egypt during the period from October 2013 until March 2014 by using the data handling tool Ubicity. Moreover, we identified certain days where relevant political events have taken place in order to identify possible event triggered changes of the daily number of Tweets. In addition, we extracted the daily number of Tweets in the big cities Cairo and Alexandria. We observed an increase of the daily numbers of Tweets during the period of ostracism of the political party "Muslim Brotherhood". The largest number of daily Tweets was observed that day, when a rare snowstorm occurred in Egypt. We found good correlation between the number of Tweets in the whole Egypt and those of the two cities Cairo and Alexandria.

AB  - Assessments of population density and contact number of individuals of the Eared Dove Zenaida auriculata were conducted in areas of the city of Londrina and were compared with those of two other species of the family Columbidae (Columbina talpacoti and C. picui). Data were collected from distance sampling in linear transects of 2,000 m. Analyses of density were calculated using the program DISTANCE. The results show that C. talpacoti and C. picui were recorded in all months in urban areas, and less frequently in rural and pasture areas. Zenaida auriculata was the most frequently recorded species in all areas, showing high rates of population density with seasonal variations; density peaks were observed during September and January in the urban area (coinciding with the arrival of warmer days in the region), while in rural areas, density peaks were also recorded during November/December, March and April/May - periods in which planting of soybean and maize, and the soybean harvest, and wheat planting in the region, occurred, respectively. The density of Z. auriculata during these months showed a value that was 93 times greater in November/December and 75 times greater in April/May, compared to the density in the other months of the year. Although Z. auriculata was considered uncommon a few decades ago, we suggest that the removal of the original forest and the expansion of agriculture in the region have provided a large amount of seeds in the environment, which might favor the increased density of Z. auriculata in the region. The high rate of population density achieved by the Eared Dove suggests that the species has found a favorable environment in the region. This includes the ease of obtaining resources, suitable sites for nesting, reproductive success and possible adaptive factors, such as the opportunist movement in search of distant food sources.

AB  - Medical-care institutions are a high source of pharmaceuticals compounds in urban wastewaters. A way to avoid the dispersal of pharmaceuticals into the environment could be to design dedicated sewage treatment plants capable of processing highly concentrated hospital and medical-care wastewaters. The present work is a survey conducted in Wallonia to further identify the most present and problematic compounds in wastewaters from medical-care institutions. An analytical method was first developed to simultaneously extract, detect and confirm 169 pharmaceutical products (PPs) in wastewater, including a purification/concentration step on an Oasis HLB* column and analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated to estimate precision and recovery. Samples were collected from hospitals, rest homes and other specialised institutions and analysed to identify PPs. Among the 45 compounds identified, 6 were selected as model compounds in hospital effluents for the design of a dedicated treatment on the basis of high concentration and occurrence, but also poor removal efficiency in urban wastewater treatment plants, persistence in the environment and potential ecotoxicity: carbamazepin, diclofenac, furosemide, lorazepam, tramadol and sulfamethoxazole.

AB  - This article reconstructs the experience of the Society of Popular Instruction, as a form of liberal political sociability developed by lawyers and other significant individuals in the city between 1843 and 1851. Initially, we present the political conflicts in which these associations were involved during the 1940's, due particularly to their involvement in provincial and national disputes. Secondly, the formalization of political groups with liberal backing is contextualized as occurring after the consolidation of the movement between 1849 and 1850. Lastly a discursive analysis of the Democratic Society of Tunja is provided with regard to its sense of belonging, strategies, utopias and dystopias, that characterized a liberal proposal in the region in the mid- 19th century. It is concluded that the liberal organization in Tunja sought to take advantage of the political situation of the time in order to improve the position of certain projects and interests of notable individuals in the city.

AB  - 'Leaderless organizations' are a seductive category in the field of Cultural Studies and critical organization studies. In the 1960s, arguably, Situationism made a fetish of the idea. Various authors made the case for direct, spontaneous action without the hierarchies and directive lead of conventional management structures. The Occupy protest movement revived this thinking. Following the Arab Spring (2011), it gained high media publicity for a series of occupations of prominent sites adjacent to international centres of finance capital. Global events provide a relevant parallel to this. Ever since Live Aid (1985) they have presented themselves as stateless solutions to international issues and emergencies. But are leaderless events possible in cultural management? This paper examines a neglected area in the sociology of culture: global event management and the type of social consciousness that it exploits and perpetuates. The Burning Man City annual event in Nevada is explored as a case of flat horizon strategy in cultural management.

AB  - Objectives:
   To describe, at patient-level detail, the determining events and factors involved in the development of a country's HIV-1 epidemic.
   Design:
   Clinical information for all recorded Greenlandic HIV-1 patients was analysed and correlated with both novel and previously analysed pol sequences, representing more than half of the entire Greenlandic HIV-1 epidemic. Archival blood samples were sequenced to link early infection chain descriptions to the subsequent epidemic.
   Methods:
   In-depth phylogenetic analyses were used in synergy with clinical information to assess number of introductions of HIV-1 into Greenland, the source of geographic origin, time of epidemic introduction and its epidemiological characteristics such as initial transmission chain, geographic dispersal within Greenland, method of infection, cluster size, sociological and behavioural factors.
   Results:
   Despite its small population size and isolated geographic location, data support at least 25 introductions of HIV-1 into Greenland. Only a single of these led to an epidemic. This introduction occurred between 1985 and 1986, and the epidemic cluster is still active. Facilitating factors for the emergence and spread of the epidemic cluster include a rapid transition from MSM to heterosexual spread, high prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases, rapid dispersal to larger cities and early emergence in a distinct subpopulation with high-risk behaviour including disregard for condomizing.
   Conclusions:
   The synergistic use of disparate data categories yields such unique detail, that the Greenland epidemic now serves as a model example for the epidemic emergence of HIV-1 in a society. This renders it suitable for testing of present and future sequence-based epidemiological methodologies.

AB  - On October 28th 2013 Hurricane Sandy hit land on the East Coast of the United States. The deadliest storm to hit the country since 2005 it caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, destroyed thousands of homes, left millions without electric service, and caused 117 deaths in the United States, including 53 in New York, making Sandy the most life costly hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina. In all an estimated 186 people were killed across the United States, the Caribbean, and Canada. In the immediate aftermath of the storm not only did the emergency services, state and federal government implement emergency plans of action, including both direct intervention on the ground and massive financial support, so too did a number of charities, community and residents groups across the US.
   One of the most surprising of these groups was what became known as Occupy Sandy. As noted by the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute: "Within hours of Sandy's landfall, members from the Occupy Wall Street movement used social media to tap the wider Occupy network for volunteers and aid. Overnight, a volunteer army of young, educated, tech-savvy individuals with time and a desire to help others emerged. In the days, weeks, and months that followed, "Occupy Sandy" became one of the leading humanitarian groups providing relief to survivors across New York City and New Jersey. At its peak, it had grown to an estimated 60,000 volunteers-more than four times the number deployed by the American Red Cross."
   What this phenomenon clearly demonstrates is the potential for digital networking to improve response to catastrophic storm events at a community level. Far from being solely a question of material support and logistics, the response to the disaster was one equally definable as digital. Pointing to the possible rethinking of issues around the extreme and localised consequences of climate change and responses to it in purely traditional infrastructural terms, the social media focused organisation of Occupy Sandy potentially offers us a new frame of reference to deal with these, and less catastrophic issues around climate change and our response to it.
   This paper provides a discussion of the projected impacts of global environmental change in urban environments in the United States, with a particular focus on their impact on existing storm and sanitary water infrastructure. However, it theorizes a new approach to this archaic system of infrastructure that exploits social networking tools and digital technologies to build greater networks for climate change resilience across the United States and, by extension, elsewhere.

AB  - Background: Dengue is an acute arboviral disease responsible for most of the illness and death in tropical and subtropical regions. Over the last 25 years there has been increase epidemic activity of the disease in the Caribbean, with the co-circulation of multiple serotypes. An understanding of the space and time dynamics of dengue could provide health agencies with important clues for reducing its impact.
   Methods: Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) cases observed for the period 1998-2004 were georeferenced using Geographic Information System software. Spatial clustering was calculated for individual years and for the entire study period using the Nearest Neighbor Index. Space and time interaction between DHF cases was determined using the Knox Test while the Nearest Neighbor Hierarchical method was used to extract DHF hot spots. All space and time distances calculated were validated using the Pearson r significance test.
   Results: Results shows that (1) a decrease in mean distance between DHF cases correlates with activity leading up to an outbreak, (2) a decrease in temporal distance between DHF cases leads to increased geographic spread of the disease, with an outbreak occurrence about every 2 years, and (3) a general pattern in the movement of dengue incidents from more rural to urban settings leading up to an outbreak with hotspot areas associated with transportation hubs in Trinidad.
   Conclusion: Considering only the spatial dimension of the disease, results suggest that DHF cases become more concentrated leading up to an outbreak. However, with the additional consideration of time, results suggest that when an outbreak occurs incidents occur more rapidly in time leading to a parallel increase in the rate of distribution of the disease across space. The results of this study can be used by public health officers to help visualize and understand the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue, and to prepare warnings for the public. Dengue space-time patterns and hotspot detection will provide useful information to support public health officers in their efforts to control and predict dengue spread over critical hotspots allowing better allocation of resources.

AB  - The landscape around the Graeco-Roman town of Neapolis was reconstructed through morphostratigraphic methods and pollen analysis of the sediments filling the bay hosting the ancient harbor. This was discovered in 2004 thanks to excavations for two new lines of the Naples metro network; the harbor's sedimentary record spans the period between the late 4th century BC and the 6th century AD. The main changes occurring in the marine and terrestrial landscape surrounding the ancient town are highlighted through the reconstruction of a detailed geological cross section and four 3D palaeogeographic models. Pollen analysis suggested the presence of mixed oak woods on the slopes surrounding the town and of vegetable gardens around the harbor area. The tree crops mainly consisted of walnut, and to a lesser extent chestnut and grapevines. The horticultural varieties were dominated by Brassicaceae, most likely representing cabbage cultivation which was rather common in Roman times. Comparison with reference pollen material reinforces this hypothesis. During the 3rd century AD a drastic decrease in horticultural activity, in concurrence with an increase in wild vegetation and tree crops, suggest reduced maintenance due to a phase of abandonment. Historical data imply for the same period a phase of economic and social decline which involved the whole Empire. From the end of the 3rd century AD, the growth of a spit bar at the port entrance gave rise to the establishment of a lagoon and then to the final closure of the bay. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Time's Up! is a New York environmental group which promotes non-polluting transportation and sustainable solutions to urban problems. Over the last twenty-five years, the group has taken a do-it-yourself approach to environmental activism, bridging neighborhood, global justice, and Occupy movements. With roots in the squatter movement in New York, Time's Up! has built its own distinct brand of DIY urbanism to fight for community gardens, support group bike rides, and create sustainable approaches to urban living. While the group makes use of a wide range of approaches to reclaim public space, direct action is its guiding principle. The group links social networks with alternative approaches to community building outside of institutional channels. The following considers Time's Up! as a case study in environmental justice DIY urbanism. (C) 2014 by The Transformative Studies Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - Unnecessary vehicle movements such as rapid acceleration/deceleration and long idling periods occur around signalized intersections, especially in urban areas. It is believed that such unnecessary vehicle movements can be reduced by providing appropriate information. Actual vehicle movements should be understood before providing such information or developing an information provision system. Thus, we observed actual vehicle movements approaching a signalized intersection and then simulated the vehicle movements with a microscopic traffic flow simulation based on the observed vehicle movements. To estimate the quantity of CO2 emitted from vehicles, each vehicle movement was analyzed by the microscopic simulation when the information was provided. The results showed that the information provided can reduce the amount of CO2 emissions. However, it also showed that it is possible that CO2 emissions are increased at higher traffic volumes.

AB  - A safe, resilient, and sustainable transportation system for efficient freight flow is critically important to a nation's economy. A major disruption to the transportation system due to extreme natural or human disasters can significantly affect the freight movement in the system. The purpose of this research was to develop a general framework to study disruptions to freight flows under an extreme event and apply the framework to retro-analyze the impact of 2005 Hurricane Katrina to the freight movement on the US highway network using a geographical information system, assignment models, and performance measures. Freight movement dynamics prior to and after the disaster are analyzed using aggregated measures such as vehicle mile traveled and vehicle time traveled for different types of roads in urban and rural areas in the USA. This research shows that when a disaster occurs to a part of the highway transportation network, the freight flow changes are not only local, but also regional and national, indicating that applying solely distance-based methods to modeling flow disruption effects may not capture the whole picture. The research provides some insights for preaEuro and postaEurodisaster decision makings that help lead to a resilient freight highway transportation system.

AB  - High-resolution seismic and sediment core data from the 'Grand Lac' basin of Lake Geneva reveal traces of repeated slope instabilities with one main slide-evolved mass-flow (minimum volume 0.13 km(3)) that originated from the northern lateral slope of the lake near the city of Lausanne. Radiocarbon dating of organic remains sampled from the top of the main deposit gives an age interval of 1865-1608 BC. This date coincides with the age interval for a mass movement event described in the 'Petit Lac' basin of Lake Geneva (1872-1622 BC). Because multiple mass movements took place at the same time in different parts of the lake, we consider the most likely trigger mechanism to be a strong earthquake (Mw 6) that occurred in the period between 1872 and 1608 BC. Based on numerical simulations, we show the major deposit near Lausanne would have generated a tsunami with local wave heights of up to 6 m. The combined effects of the earthquake and the following tsunami provide a possible explanation for a gap in lake dwellers occupation along the shores of Lake Geneva revealed by dendrochronological dating of two palafitte archaeological sites.

AB  - Lakes Dendi, Wonchi and Ziqualla are among the few remnants of undisturbed crater lakes in the central highlands of Ethiopia, and have never been investigated reliably owing to seclusion and inaccessibility. As the lakes offer a pristine environment in a beautiful landscape and are located in the vicinity of the capital city Addis Ababa, they are highly threatened by unsustainable tourism, shoreline and crater rim modifications, water abstraction and land grabbing. We provide a first limnological description to establish baseline data against which future environmental and biological changes can be monitored. The lakes are located above 2,800 m elevation with no surface outflow and generally show low concentrations of ions, displaying an equal distribution of readily soluble components like Na or K throughout the water column, but distinct oxygen depletion in greater depths linked to rising concentrations of Fe and Mn, which indicates subterranean springs. Based on nutrients, chlorophyll a, and water transparency, lakes Dendi and Wonchi are classified as oligotrophic and Ziqualla as oligo-mesotrophic. The phytoplankton community is dominated by coccal green algae, desmids and dinoflagellates in lakes Dendi and Wonchi, typical for unpolluted dilute waterbodies; whereas chlorococcales, in particular Botryococcus braunii and benthic diatoms, prevail in Ziqualla. The zooplankton fauna is depauperate, comprising a total of 11 rotifer taxa and 13 crustaceans. Copepods were the most abundant group and contributed over 60% to the total zooplankton abundance in all three lakes, followed by rotifers and cladocerans. The conservation significance of these lakes lies predominantly in their representation of dilute, nutrient-poor highland lake systems that support diverse biota assemblages like desmids and daphnids, which are highly sensitive to eutrophication.

AB  - This study attempts to evaluate the achievement effect of ability grouping on student performance on the National College Entrance Exam in China. The context of this study is the ongoing school reform movement occurring in many Chinese municipalities. The current reform movement is striving to achieve educational equity and quality by integrating initial low achievers into high-performing schools. The propensity score matching method is employed as the identification strategy. After controlling for self-selection bias in high school assignment, this study finds that while there is no effect of high ability grouping at the school level on academic achievement, initial low achievers' academic performances can be significantly improved when integrated with high performing students at the school level. In addition, between-class grouping significantly improves student performance in a heterogeneous school-level grouping. Upon analyzing the results, rich information on school level input is reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2002, the year it was published, The Environmentalism of the Poor was one of the first books examining in a multidisciplinary perspective three parallel environmental movements around the world. Eleven years later, we re-examine these movements - the Cult of Wilderness, the Gospel of Eco-Efficiency and the Mantra of Environmental Justice, - focusing on the increased visibility of struggles representing Environmental justice and The Environmentalism of the Poor. Even if they are often disconnected from an organizational standpoint, glocal manifestations of resistance have emerged since the 1990s. Today, environmental movements assert common values related to place, identity, and culture. Activists' concepts such as ecological debt, environmental justice, environmental liabilities, land grabbing, environmental gentrification, corporate accountability, climate justice, food sovereignty, or economic degrowth are the keywords of the networks of the global Environmental justice movement. At the same time, such concepts support the rural and urban movements that remake place for marginalized groups, re-assert traditional practices, and protect territory from contamination, land appropriation, and real estate speculation. Some possibilities exist for cooperation between Environmental justice and the other varieties of environmentalism. Here, comparative research can help unravel the use of valuation languages different from "green" economic growth or sustainable development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The worldwide distribution of dengue is expanding, in part due to globalized traffic and trade. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector for dengue viruses (DENV) and is now established in numerous regions of Europe. Viremic travellers arriving in Europe from dengue-affected areas of the world can become catalysts of local outbreaks in Europe. Local dengue transmission in Europe is extremely rare, and the last outbreak occurred in 1927-28 in Greece. However, autochthonous transmission was reported from France in September 2010, and from Croatia between August and October 2010.
   Methodology: We compiled data on areas affected by dengue in 2010 from web resources and surveillance reports, and collected national dengue importation data. We developed a hierarchical regression model to quantify the relationship between the number of reported dengue cases imported into Europe and the volume of airline travellers arriving from dengue-affected areas internationally.
   Principal Findings: In 2010, over 5.8 million airline travellers entered Europe from dengue-affected areas worldwide, of which 703,396 arrived at 36 airports situated in areas where Ae. albopictus has been recorded. The adjusted incidence rate ratio for imported dengue into European countries was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01-1.17) for every increase of 10,000 travellers; in August, September, and October the rate ratios were 1.70 (95% CI: 1.23-2.35), 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02-2.10), and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01-1.81), respectively. Two Italian cities where the vector is present received over 50% of all travellers from dengue-affected areas, yet with the continuing vector expansion more cities will be implicated in the future. In fact, 38% more travellers arrived in 2013 into those parts of Europe where Ae. albopictus has recently been introduced, compared to 2010.
   Conclusions: The highest risk of dengue importation in 2010 was restricted to three months and can be ranked according to arriving traveller volume from dengue-affected areas into cities where the vector is present. The presence of the vector is a necessary, but not sufficient, prerequisite for DENV onward transmission, which depends on a number of additional factors. However, our empirical model can provide spatio-temporal elements to public health interventions.

AB  - The reliable prediction of coverage footprint resulting from an airborne wireless radio base station, is at utmost importance, when it comes to the new emerging applications of air-to-ground wireless services. These applications include the rapid recovery of damaged terrestrial wireless infrastructure due to a natural disaster, as well as the fulfillment of sudden wireless traffic overload in certain spots due to massive movement of crowds. In this paper, we propose a statistical propagation model for predicting the air-to-ground path loss between a low altitude platform and a terrestrial terminal. The prediction is based on the urban environment properties, and is dependent on the elevation angle between the terminal and the platform. The model shows that air-to-ground path loss is following two main propagation groups, characterized by two different path loss profiles. In this paper we illustrate the methodology of which the model was deduced, as well as we present the different path loss profiles including the occurrence probability of each.

AB  - Set as a reserve in 1938 by the general governor of French Equatorial Africa (AEF), the Patte d'Oie forest covered originally 240 ha of which deforestation now isolates three statements for a total area of 95 ha, thus less than 39% of the original area. Originally a perish-urban forest, it has now become intra-urban, and shelters three statements of natural forests, administrative buildings, plantations of Pinus sp. and Eucalyptus sp., an arboretum dedicated to the wet dense forests of the Congo Basin, the sporting and university installations and a zoological park. The Patte d'Oie forest and the four others which completely disappeared (the Tsieme, the Corniche, the Glaciere and the Tchad) from urban space, these four forest statements have not been the object of an in-depth study. Before this study, the phytoecological data on the three forest statements were partial and generalized from studies carried on less than 1000 m(2). Moreover, they do not make any difference between the natural forest and the plantations. The floristic inventory of the forest statements reveals pauciflorous ecosystems (with 79.5 +/- 5.5 species per statement) compared to the wet dense forests of the Congo Basin. The floristic composition is sub-identic in the three statements forest and it is dominated by the Guineo-Congolese species (30 to 37.8%), in particular those belonging to the endemism sub-centre of the Low-Guinean (22 to 24%). The predominance of the sarcochores indicates that the principal mode of dissemination is the sarcochory (zoochory). However, the proportion of the anemochores dominated by pterochores (6 to 19%) and the good representativeness of heliophilous species are obvious signals of the disturbance of these ecosystems. The relative diversity of the families varies from 0.5 to 19.4% in the forest statements; the most represented are Rubiaceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Dioscoreaceae. The relative frequency of taxa varies between 0.5 and 2.7%, whereas the relative density varies from 0.03 to 37.6%. The most abundant species are Rothmannia octomera, Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum, Markhamia tomentosa, Caloncoba welwitschii and Chaetocarpus africanus. Within this flora, the phanerophytes are dominating over the geophytes and the chamephytes. Finally, from a phytoecological standpoint, the three stands fall within the same ecological group. The analysis of the underwood flora reveals that only introduced species are represented by large trees, whereas the indigenous woody flora is represented by the shrubby species (Bosqueiopsis gilletii, Dracaena arborea, Voacanga chalotiana, Strychnos variabilis, Millettia eetveldeana and Markhamia tomentosa). The relative frequencies and the densities indicate that, except for Markhamia tomentosa, all the ligneous species characterising these ecosystems are disseminated. The consequence, induced by this space distribution of the ligneous species, is an insufficient installation of sowings, thus a poor natural regeneration. Moreover, the immigrant taxa have a good representativeness, in general, in the underwood forest stands. By associating remarkably density and interspecific competition, these species should characterise in the future the three stands of the Patte d'Oie forest.

AB  - A response to conceptions of heritage as process, this paper puts forward a (re) enactment of heritage (studies) in which the lively materiality, temporality and mobility of an event become entangled with the performance of its research. The event in question is the Lord Mayor's Show in London. First established eight centuries ago, the Show is an annual ritual and touristic performance of The City; London's historic heart and today's global financial centre. One day each year, City life is temporarily suspended by the passing of the new Lord Mayor in his State Coach accompanied by a procession of well over one hundred participating organisations with an audience of tens of thousands lining the route. 2011 was a particularly event-ful year for the Show taking place as it did amidst a global financial crisis and the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest movement camped outside St Paul's Cathedral, disrupting the regular processional route. In drawing on aspects of non-representational theory from human and cultural geography, a more performative sense of doing heritage studies emerges that attends to the lived process and actions of heritage.

AB  - We investigated whether high-intensity road traffic affects the nestbox occupancy pattern of secondary hole-nesting birds. Field studies were carried out in two forests in south-eastern Poland (Lasy Janowskie forest and Polichna forest). Both complexes were included in NATURA 2000 network. In our knowledge it was first field experiment on road-traffic noise influence on forest birds, conducted in the Polish environmental conditions. The results of this experiment can be used in work on the impact of road projects on forest birds. Nestboxes were hung at twelve linear transects located perpendicularly to the busy road and they were regularly inspected in 2011-2012. Road noise was measured by use of a digital measurer of sound level at each nestbox. Monitoring the activity of predators on the study area was done with the help of digital trail cameras and experiment with use of artificial nest with eggs. Noise level decreased with distance from the road. In the first year of experiment we observed that the birds settled preferentially habitats in the vicinity of road. However in next season the number of occupied nestboxes was independent from the distance from road. We found that the pressure caused by predators on the study area was very low, creating safer nesting places for birds. Our results provide evidence that these birds are well adapted to cope with anthropogenic noise. Some species of birds preferred nesting in neighbourhood of road.

AB  - This article arises from an ongoing research project about the manifestations of punk in Portuguese society from 1977 to date. The approach to studying Portuguese punk occurs along the following axes: analysing punk music from the perspective of cultural representation; identifying punk subcultural practices; addressing the contours of Portuguese punk as social movement, scene or neo-tribe; assessing sociopolitical participation; and identifying urban forms of resistance and the occupation of space. The author underlines the different positions of social actors presently involved in the punk movement in Portugal in terms of their relation to the assumption of punk as a contemporary form of social and political resistance and a structural axis of the recomposition of new contemporary social movements; in addition to tracking the movements and struggles against the risks engendered by fragmentation stemming from the economic crisis and the deterioration of the overall quality of life. Here, the author seeks to identify the relationships between punk and contemporary forms of youth struggle. Data comprising 40 interviews with key Portuguese punk social actors, representative of the different regions, generations and scenes currently available in Portugal, inform the study.

AB  - Over the next decade, developing countries like Bangladesh will experience an alarming increase in road accidents and this will continue to remain as a serious challenge. Developing countries are experiencing a very high growth rate of vehicles, which is doubling the vehicle fleet in some countries in even five years. The complexity of the road environment with mixed traffic is another reality of road transportation in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where road planning and designs are not appropriate for mixed traffic conditions. Of particular concern are the urban intersections where differential approach speed is a major problem. The heterogeneity of traffic exceeding the capacity, plying of modes with varying speed and maneuvering time make the road links as well as intersections of Dhaka even more complex. The objectives of the study are to determine the characteristics of the road traffic accidents of Dhaka city for the following parameters: a) Traffic accident trend b) Traffic Control Parameters c) Traffic Accident at Junctions d) Traffic Control and Road Dividers e) Traffic Accidents and Road Geometry. Traffic accident data for the period of year 2007-2011 were collected from the Police Stations of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) area. The data were compiled from the Police Reports accident by accident and analyzed using an MS Access based database and additionally an ArcGIS software for the selected variables. All the roadway sections and intersections of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) were considered in the study. A total number of two thousand seven hundred twenty (2720) accidents that were recorded by police during the period of year 2007-2011 were analyzed. The study revealed that a) number of accidents in Dhaka is reducing by more than ten (10) percent every year b) Sixty three percent (63%) of the accidents took place where there was no traffic control c) Only twenty nine percent (29%) of the accidents took place at intersection areas and T-junctions were found to be the most vulnerable junction type d) Seventy three percent (73%) accidents occurred on divided roadways or where only one-way traffic movement existed e) Ninety seven percent (97%) of the accidents occurred on straight road sections. Improvement of the traffic accident data collection system in Dhaka is necessary. Detailed study on under-reporting of traffic accident is also recommended.

AB  - The harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) has invaded and established in Slovakia. Following unintentional introduction in 2008, the spread of the alien coccinellid was very fast. By the end of 2009, it was recorded across the whole country, and by the end of 2012 it was widely distributed and common in various habitats, particularly gardens, orchards and urban areas, where it was most frequent on trees. The rate of eastward spread was approximately 200 km year(-1), similar to the overall rate of spread in Europe. Between 2008 and 2012, the coccinellid was recorded in a total of 153 localities, in altitudes ranging from 98 to 1,250 m. Most records of this species were made in lowlands, hilly areas and valleys separating mountain ridges. However, it was only rarely documented in areas above 700 m a.s.l. The non-melanic colour form (f. succinea) was dominant along a longitudinal transect including eight urban areas across Slovakia, with the frequency of melanic forms (f. spectabilis and f. conspicua together) between 6.3 and 19.2% and a median equal to 10.5%. The invasion history and distribution of H. axyridis in Slovakia are discussed with regard to the time sequence of records, rate of spread, altitudinal distribution, anthropogenic dispersal, effective recording, proportion of melanic forms and other relevant aspects associated with the spread of this successful invader.

AB  - Kastamonu and its neighbourhood, located in the Northern Anatolia, played a crucial role in the protection of the homeland against occupations following the World War I. However, this part of Anatolia had never been occupied in the wake of the Armistice of Mudros signed by Ottoman government. Following the armistice a branch of the Association for Defence of National Rights was promptly established and organized in the region. Moreover, armed forces were settled and meetings were organized. Local people were informed on ongoing events through the press. Thus, this study aims to shed light to some remarkable points on the organization of the national movement in Kastamonu and its neigbourhood as well as the contribution of the city to the War of Independence.

AB  - The current paper presents the study that was implemented in the framework of a diploma thesis in the school of Civil Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki aiming at evaluating and managing the seismic risk of the internal Ring Road of Thessaloniki in Greece, focusing on the bridges along it. To achieve this, the study includes the following steps: i) the assessment of the seismic hazard of the area, ii) the examination of the structural vulnerability of the bridges and iii) the redirection of traffic in the adjacent urban road network after the occurrence of seismic faults on some of the examined bridges. Towards this direction firstly, some general meanings are presented related to the seismic risk of everyday life activities' networks and the factors which influence them, namely the seismic hazard of the area, the structural vulnerability and the importance of the element under consideration, specializing in road networks. Secondly, the available methods for classification and creation of vulnerability curves of bridges at international and national level are described in detail. The geological and geotechnical aspects of the study area are given and in combination with the available soil simulants, the seismic response of the soil in the area around the bridges for a certain earthquake scenario is calculated. The earthquake scenario is calculated with an average period of reintroduction T-m = 475 years and maximum acceleration on rocky background equal to 0.25g. Based on the method FEMA-NIBS (HAZUS), the corresponding vulnerability curves for all the bridges along the inner Ring Road are notified that are likely to experience higher levels of damage in the case of the examined earthquake scenario. With the results presented above, scenarios of traffic rearrangement are presented, in case of a possible blockade of roads due to repair works in two of these bridges. To this end, the best alternative route of the road network in the area is identified and the new distances and timing of such routes are evaluated. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the present thesis work are summarized.

AB  - Background: Structural alterations of a large network characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the time course of these changes remains unclear. The dynamic of these alterations was examined in the AD preclinical phase using data from the 10-year follow-up of a population-based cohort (Bordeaux-3 City).
   Methods: Participants received neuropsychological assessments every 2 years and two identical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams at baseline and 4 years later. Twenty-five incident AD cases were compared with 319 subjects who remained free of dementia. Subjects were free of dementia at baseline and at follow-up MRI. Incident AD occurred after these time points.
   Results: At baseline, incident AD already presented smaller volumes only in the left amygdalohippocampal complex. Moreover, a higher annual rate of atrophy of the temporoparietal cortices was observed in future AD subjects during the following 4 years.
   Conclusion: Incident AD cases present mediotemporal lesions up to 5 years before diagnosis. This neurodegenerative process seems to progressively reach the temporoparietal cortices in the AD preclinical phase. (C) 2014 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prevention is an integral component of many management strategies for aquatic invasive species, yet this represents a formidable task when the landscapes to be managed include multiple invasive species, thousands of waterbodies, and limited resources to implement action. Species distributional modeling can facilitate prevention efforts by identifying locations that are most vulnerable to future invasion based on the likelihood of introduction and environmental suitability for establishment. We used a classification tree approach to predict the vulnerability of lakes in Washington State (United States) to three noxious invasive plants: Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), Brazilian egeria (Egeria densa), and curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus). Overall, the distribution models predicted that approximately one-fifth (54 out of 319 study lakes) of lakes were at risk of being invaded by at least one aquatic invasive plant, and many of these predicted vulnerable lakes currently support high native plant diversity and endemism. Highly vulnerable lakes are concentrated in western Washington in areas with the highest human population densities, and in eastern Washington along the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project and the Okanogan River Basin that boast hundreds of lakes subject to recreational use. Overall, invasion potential for the three species was highly predictable as a function of lake attributes describing human accessibility (e.g., public boat launch, urban land use) and physical chemical conditions (e.g., lake area, elevation, productivity, total phosphorous). By identifying highly vulnerable lake ecosystems, our study offers a strategy for prioritizing on the ground management action and informing the most efficient allocation of resources to minimize future plant invasions in vast freshwater networks.

AB  - Background
   Health workers move between public and private organizations in both urban and rural areas during the course of their career. Depending on the proportion of the population served by public or private organizations in a particular setting, this movement may result in imbalances in the number of healthcare providers available relative to the population receiving care from that sector. However, both public and private organizations are needed as each sector has unique contributions to make to the effective delivery of health services.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of financial incentives and movement restriction interventions to manage the movement of health workers between public and private organizations in low-and middle-income countries.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (10 November 2012); EMBASE (7 June 2011); LILACS (9 June 2011); MEDLINE (10 November 2012); CINAHL (13 August 2012); and the British Nursing Index (13 August 2012).
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials; controlled before-and-after studies if pre- and post-intervention periods for study and control groups were the same and there were at least two units included in both the intervention and control groups; uncontrolled and controlled interrupted time series studies if the point in time when the intervention occurred was clearly defined and there were at least three or more data points before and after the intervention. Interventions included payment of special allowances, increasing salaries, bonding health workers, offering bursary schemes, scholarships or lucrative terminal benefits, and hiring people on contract basis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently applied the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies to the titles and abstracts of all articles obtained from the search. The same two review authors independently screened the full reports of the selected citations. At each stage, we compared the results and resolved discrepancies through discussion with a third review author.
   Main results
   We found no studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review.
   Authors' conclusions
   We identified no rigorous studies on the effects of interventions to manage the movement of health workers between public and private organizations in low- and middle-income countries. Health worker availability is a key obstacle in delivery of health services. Interventions to make the health sector more responsive to the expectations of populations by having more health workers in the sector that serves most people would contribute to the more efficient use of the health workforce. More research is needed to assess the effect of increase in salaries, offering scholarships or bonding on movement of health workers in one sector compared with another.

AB  - Hedgehogs are one of the most common mammalian road fatalities in Europe. Between April 2008 and November 2010, two stretches of road measuring 227 km (Cork City to Caherlistrane, Co. Galway) and 32.5 km (Cork City to Bandon, Co. Cork) respectively were surveyed for hedgehog road kill. In addition to the sightings of road kill on the two stretches of road, a further 135 carcasses were collected over the study period from throughout Ireland and the sex and age group were recorded. Over the three years, a total of 50 430 km were surveyed and 133 hedgehog fatalities were observed between the two surveyed roads. The number of hedgehog road kill per km in the current study was low when compared to countries such as Belgium, Poland and New Zealand. It is suggested that this may be a consequence of hedgehogs having a greater opportunity to encounter larger busier roads in other countries. Over the three years, the majority of the 133 carcasses sighted were located beside pasture, which was the most prominent habitat along both routes. Arable land was the only habitat used in a greater proportion than what was available. K-function analysis detected clustering along the surveyed roads, with fatalities clustering annually at several locations. This would suggest that hedgehogs may use specific crossing points which would be important for the implementation of management strategies and underpass construction. Of the 135 hedgehog carcasses collected from throughout Ireland there was significantly more males than females collected, with peaks in male deaths occurring in May and June. Female deaths only outnumbered males in August, with further peaks in female deaths observed in June and July. It is suggested that these peaks are related to the breeding season (adults) and dispersal/exploration following independence (juveniles).

AB  - Urban streams are under increasing threat from anthropogenic disturbances that alter their biological, chemical and physical characteristics. To attempt to repair the negative consequences of urbanization, management activities are commonly implemented with the aim of rehabilitating or restoring habitats. However, subsequent monitoring of these efforts is often done poorly or not at all. The setting of goals for these projects is also hindered by a lack of knowledge about the likely size of any potential response, and also the scope for undertaking activities at sufficient scales to override the likely larger-scale effects of urbanization. In this study, we completed a series of surveys in a large, urban estuary to generate information that can be used to assess the likely responses of fish to management activities aimed at rehabilitating estuary bank habitats. Initially, we mapped the banks of the estuary to describe the distribution of different potential habitat types for fishes. Surveys were then carried out to assess associations between fish and these habitats, with a view to providing an indication of the likely effect size that management works might produce. We then initiated a BACI (Before-After Control-Impact)-style monitoring design around management works aimed at stabilizing the banks of the estuary and increasing habitat complexity for fishes (the installation of coir logs and planting of native rushes). Power analyses based on the effect sizes and estimates of variability from our initial survey and subsequent monitoring respectively indicate that only large magnitude responses will be detectable. However, these are likely to be constrained by the influence of the larger-scale effects of urbanization. Even if localized responses occur, wider-scale manipulations to fish habitat in large urban estuaries are likely to be limited by a range of logistical, social and financial constraints that govern the scale and location of management activities.

AB  - The green mussel Perna viridis (Linnaeus 1758), a native of the Indo-Pacific, has been introduced to the Atlantic basin and Caribbean Sea. It was reported first in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba, in 2005. This species has proliferated quickly and now constitutes an economic as well as ecological problem, interfering with the operations of a local thermoelectric plant. The objectives of this study were to document the spatial and temporal variation in P. viridis density across Cienfuegos Bay and to examine the relationship between P. viridis density and water-quality patterns within the bay. The presence and relative abundance of P. viridis were surveyed qualitatively in Cienfuegos Bay in January 2011. Four sites were selected for additional investigation, and mussel density was estimated 6 times during 2011 and 2012. Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen also were measured. We found that P. viridis density differed across Cienfuegos Bay both temporally and spatially, and that, although salinity may play a role in green mussel distribution and density, other factors were also important. The greatest densities of P. viridis were located near the city of Cienfuegos on the northeastern shore of the bay. The results of our systematic sampling also revealed dramatic temporal variation in the Cienfuegos Bay P. viridis population. During the 22-mo study, green mussel density at two of the sampling sites declined by an order of magnitude. There are several possible explanations for the dramatic decline in P. viridis density during the sampling period. Among them are mortality resulting from stressful environmental conditions and removal through harvest, both coupled with low recruitment rates. The decline of the population in the bay suggests that this species is not a candidate for a commercial fishery and that manual harvest may be an efficient means of eradication, if desired.

AB  - A survey of the modern carabid fauna of Maine has shown that the fauna consists of 425 documented species, 14 more than previously documented for the Maine fauna in the latest catalog for the family in North America or in the most recent checklist on the state beetle fauna. New state records are Agonum cupreum Dejean, Amara anthobia Villa and Villa, Anisodactylus laetus Dejean, Bembidion intermedium Kirby, Bembidion sejunctum sejunctum Casey, Brachinus vulcanoides Erwin, Diplocheila impressicollis Dejean, Elaphropus dolosus LeConte, Lebia grandis Hentz, Myas coracinus Say, Olisthopus micans LeConte, Panagaeus fasciatus Say, Pentagonica picticornis Bates, and Tachyta parvicornis Notman. The record for B. sejunctum sejunctum is the first for the species in the eastern United States. A recent record for Omophron labiatum (F.) in the state could not be substantiated by any specimen. Notes on biology are presented for species for which that knowledge exists. Distributions are presented for all taxa based on standard biophysical regions for the state and the knowledge of those distributions; distribution maps are presented for all species for which township records are known and for which we have specimen records in our database. Work on better defining the current distributional limits is ongoing. Several adventive European taxa have already exhibited very rapid dispersal across the state.

AB  - Whaling lasted for almost four centuries in Brazil (1603-1987). Pressed by environmental protection agencies and the public opinion, the Jose Sarney Administration (1985-1990) permanently banned whale hunting in December 1987, through the Federal Law 7,643. The law prompted a local and national debate on any losses the end of whaling would bring to the economy of the city of Lucena and the state of Paraiba. This article discusses the crisis of whaling in Brazil by analyzing the debates that occurred among biologists, politicians, environmentalists and the whaling industry workers in the municipality of Lucena. Both the available academic literature on the subject and newspapers of the 1980s were used, especially Paraiba's publications of the period.

AB  - Eradication of invasive species is an important component for species conservation and ecosystem restoration. Success of eradications is dependent on knowledge of population connectivity in order to determine reinvasion pathways, and hence populations requiring simultaneous eradication (eradication units). The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was introduced into New Zealand from Australia and Tasmania, and now occupies a wide range of habitats across the majority of New Zealand. Possums are one of the most destructive invaders within New Zealand, with extensive control operations occurring throughout the country. Understanding the population connectivity of possums on mainland New Zealand (North and South Islands) will enhance the success of planned eradications. We examined the genetic population structure of invasive possums to identify gene flow, thus reinvasion pathways, between seven populations around Dunedin and on the Otago Peninsula where eradication of possums is occurring. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite loci was comparable between all sampled populations and exhibited a significant isolation by distance pattern. Bayesian clustering methods supported the existence of two population clusters, indicating the presence of a reinvasion pathway onto the Otago Peninsula from urban areas at the Southern end of the Peninsula. To avoid recolonisation, all possums on the Otago Peninsula should be eradicated simultaneously, with the implementation and ongoing maintenance and monitoring of an urban buffer zone. We recommend pre-eradication genetic analyses be adopted by all pest managers to define appropriate eradication units, thereby maximising eradication success and avoiding costly failures.

AB  - The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is for the majority of cases unknown and more studies of risk factors are needed. Geographic variation in ASD occurrence has been observed, and urban residence has been suggested to serve as a proxy for etiologic and identification factors in ASD. We examined the association between urbanicity level and ASD at birth and during childhood. The study used a Danish register-based cohort of more than 800,000 children of which nearly 4,000 children were diagnosed with ASD. We found a dose-response association with greater level of urbanicity and risk of ASD. This association was found for residence at birth as well as residence during childhood. Further, we found an increased risk of ASD in children who moved to a higher level of urbanicity after birth. Also, earlier age of ASD diagnosis in urban areas was observed. While we could not directly examine the specific reasons behind these associations, our results demonstrating particularly strong associations between ASD diagnosis and post-birth migration suggest the influence of identification-related factors such as access to services might have a substantive role on the ASD differentials we observed.

AB  - Indoor thermal environment is one of the criteria in sustainable building. This criterion is important in ensuring a healthy indoor environment for the occupants. The consideration of environmental concerns at the early design stage would effectively integrate the sustainability of the building environment. Global climate changes such as global warming do affect human comfort since people spend most of their time and activities in the building. The increasing of urban population required additional housing for households, as well as places to shop, office and other facilities. Occupants are now more conscious the importance of sustainability for a better quality of life. Good thermal environment is essential for human wellness and comfort. A residential environment will influence residents' health and safety. The global warming increase the earth's temperature and greenhouse emission to the atmosphere cause adverse effects to the outdoor environment. Residential developments modify the materials, structure and energy balance in urban climate effects of human economic activities. As an indoor environment is influenced by the outdoor condition, the factors affecting indoor thermal environment are crucial in improving a comfortable and healthy environment in residential building. The microclimatic of a site such as temperature and relative humidity, and wind movement led to the variation of indoor thermal environment in the building.

AB  - Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 mu m (PM10), organic carbon (DC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations were measured simultaneously in the indoor and outdoor air of 4 residences located in urban and sub-urban areas in northwestern Portugal. The residences were studied with occupants. One residence was also studied without any indoor activity, taking advantage of the fact that the occupants had moved into a new home. First, 48-h aerosol samples were collected on quartz fiber filters with low-volume samplers equipped with size selective inlets. The filters were weighed and then analyzed for OC and EC using a thermal optical transmittance method. The average indoor and outdoor PM10 concentrations in the occupied residences were 71.9 +/- 38.3 mu g/m(3) and 54.0 +/- 13.3 mu g/m(3), respectively. Despite the higher concentration of PM10 indoors, outdoor sources were found to be a significant contributor to indoor concentrations. An estimate based on data from the residence studied under different occupancy conditions indicated that outdoor sources can account for 68% of the indoor PM10, mass concentration. Average indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios for DC ranged from 1.7 to 5.6 in occupied residences, showing that indoor sources, such as cooking, smoking, biomass burning and movement of people, strongly influenced indoor OC concentrations. In contrast, I/O ratios for EC were close to I, except for a smokers' residence, suggesting that indoor concentrations were mainly controlled by outdoor sources, most likely from vehicular emissions and biomass burning.

AB  - Near-roadway ambient black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were measured at two schools adjacent to a freeway and at an urban background school 2 km from the freeway to determine the change in concentrations attributable to vehicle emissions after the three-lane expansion of U.S. Highway 95 (US 95) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Between summer 2007 and summer 2008, average weekday small-vehicle volume increased by 40% +/- 2% (standard error). Average weekday large-vehicle volume decreased by 17% +/- 5%, due to a downturn in the economy and an associated decline in goods movement. Average vehicle speed increased from 58 to 69 mph, a 16% +/- 1% increase. The authors compared BC and CO concentrations in summer 2007 with those in summer 2008 to understand what effect the expansion of the freeway may have had on ambient concentrations: BC and CO were measured 17 m north of the freeway sound wall, CO was measured 20 m south of the sound wall, and BC was measured at an urban background site 2 km south of the freeway. Between summer 2007 and summer 2008, median BC decreased at the near-road site by 40% +/- 2% and also decreased at the urban background site by 24% +/- 4%, suggesting that much of the change was due to decreases in emissions throughout Las Vegas, rather than only on US 95. CO concentrations decreased by 14% +/- 2% and 10% +/- 3% at the two near-road sites. The decrease in BC concentrations after the expansion is likely due to the decrease in medium-and heavy-duty-vehicle traffic resulting from the economic recession. The decrease in CO concentrations may be a result of improved traffic flow, despite the increase in light-duty-vehicle traffic.
   Implications: Monitoring of BC and CO at near-road locations in Las Vegas demonstrated the impacts of changes in traffic volume and vehicle speed on near-road concentrations. However, urban-scale declines in concentrations were larger than near-road changes due to the impacts of the economic recession that occurred contemporaneously with the freeway expansion.

AB  - In Brazil, the movement of landless peasants and poor people excluded from the urban labor market to occupy uncultivated lands for agricultural production is widespread. We examined whether settling on occupied land enables landless peasants to improve their livelihood or not, and which agricultural practices should be implemented at the initial stage of migration in order to secure production sufficient for subsistence, by comparing households in two settlements that were at different time periods of the migration process. The survey results suggest that the selection and combination of crop species is an important factor for producing both sales income and subsistence. Providing crop species-specific information essential to generating sales income and subsistence-e.g., harvest season, fruiting age, and market value-may increase the chances of alleviating poverty.

AB  - Objectives: Orthostatic tremor is a specific form of tremor which is characterized by a subjective feeling of unsteadiness during stance, not present in other positions. The diagnosis can be confirmed in the electromyographic or accelerometric study by recording the tremor (e. g. in the quadriceps muscle) of frequency 13-18 Hz occurring exclusively in the upright position. Case report: In the present case, despite the presence of the classic features of orthostatic tremor the proper diagnosis has been much delayed. Conclusions: The paper presents the characteristic features of this rare movement disorder, indicates some diagnostic possibilities, and emphasizes the need for disseminating the knowledge about the disease which can be treated successfully.

AB  - Although thermal comfort standards indicate that in hot climates natural ventilation can offset the temperature above which air conditioning becomes necessary, actual applications remain scarce. This paper details the results of the post-occupancy evaluation of an office building in the subtropical Chinese city of Shenzhen, which uses natural ventilation through user-controlled windows to reduce yearly air-conditioning time by 35 %. Investigation of the indoor environment and thermal comfort of occupants showed overall satisfaction. Electricity consumption of the office part of the building was found to be 60.2 kWh/m(2).a, which is below the standard deviation band of a statistical sample of 57 Shenzhen office buildings. These results support the feasibility of using natural ventilation in mixed-mode buildings in subtropical climates for increased energy efficiency.

AB  - Political opportunities for protest mobilization were changing during the second Fidesz-government 2010-2014. The governmnet with two-third majority was able to change the constitution, and the New Basic Law plus other new laws made a conducive environment for an active governance, which restructured the political field. Among others, mobilization of new political movements and protest campaigns showed the new patterns of the political conflicts. Our research was based upon a PHD seminar with 8-10 members on the Eatvos Lorand University Faculty of Law Institute of Political Science 2013/14 semesters.
   Participants of the seminar analyzed new and restructured political and social movements from the point of view of goals, organizational patterns and structural background, social composition, and political influence. There were case studies made and interpreted by the members of the seminar on the political movement "Milla" (One Million People for the Freedom of the Media in Hungary) citizen's initiative, the two parties of the Hungarian Greens Lehet Mas a Politika" (There is another politics possible) and "Parbeszed Magyarorszagert" (A Dialogue for Hungary) as well as the radical right party "Jobbik" (We are the better alternative), the women's and the LGBTQ people's movements and the student movement occupying the university as well as the,"Varos Mindenkie" (The City belongs to everybody), an initiative helping the homeless people in Budapest.
   There were new tendencies described compared to the 2006-2010 governmental periode, when violent clashes occured among oppositional demonstrations and the police, involving the burning and mainfold destruction of the headquarter of the Hungarian Broadcast and TV at the city center and many causalities on both sides as well as a longer lasting political crisis and decline of citizen's trust and support towards the political institutions. The new government try to practicize tolerance towards the new opositional movements which are using a wide range of non-violent tactics of civil disobedience/especially students, and the initiative for the homeless.

AB  - There is a growing contemporary body of literature about the 'new mobilities' increasingly mobile populations and their impacts on local economies, particularly in more sparsely populated areas of developed nations. Much of the focus has been on the 'fly in/fly out' workforce associated with mining projects, but attention has also been paid to increasing numbers of 'fly in/fly out' workers in the health sector, the changing nature of tourist populations, the use of temporary contract labour for government administration, and the movement of Indigenous people from remote communities into urban centres. This paper uses five case examples in South Australia and the Northern Territory (Australia's 'spine') to examine the diversity of experiences of the new mobilities. The paper presents a framework for investigating new mobilities at the local settlement level through developing an understanding of macro and micro factors driving mobility and the consequences in terms of aspects of social and economic distance between mobile populations and host communities. The framework provides for useful insights to be drawn from secondary data sources including the Australian Census and tourist surveys. The paper concludes that the geographic characteristics of short term mobility observed in this research essentially conform to the 'Eight Ds' model of the human and economic geography of sparsely populated areas.

AB  - In November 2001, Nature published a letter in which University of California Berkeley's biologists claimed to have found evidence of genetically modified (GM) DNA in regional varieties of maize in Oaxaca, even though the Mexican government had banned transgenic corn agriculture in 1998. While urban protesters marched against the genetic contamination' of Mexican corn by US-based agricultural biotech firms, rural indigenous communities needed a framework for understanding concepts such as GM before they could take action. This article analyzes how the indigenous organization, the Zapatistas, mobilized a program to address this novel entity. Their anti-GM project entailed educating local farmers about genetics, importing genetic testing kits, seed-banking landrace corn and sending seeds to solidarity growers' around the world. This article explores material-semiotic translations to explain one of the central aspects of this project, the definition and circulation of Zapatista corn - an entity defined not only through cultural geography, but also technological means. Through its circulation, Zapatista corn serves to perform a biocultural engagement with Zapatista's political project of resistance to neoliberalism. While much has been written about both regulatory policy and consumer activism against GM in the Global North, Zapatista corn also provides a case study in indigenous, anti-GM activism founded on biocultural innovation and the creation of alternative networks for circulating corn.

AB  - The current Indian indoor comfort standards do not reflect the country's great cultural and climatic diversity. There have been very few reports on the actual environments in Indian offices in the last three decades. We conducted a thermal comfort field study in 28 naturally ventilated (NV) and air-conditioned (AC) offices in Chennai and Hyderabad for fourteen months, and collected 6048 responses from 2787 individuals. Warm humid and composite climates are experienced in these cities, and these two climates cover about 80% area of the country.
   This paper proposes an adaptive thermal comfort model for South India based on this data. Mean comfort temperature was found to be 28.0 degrees C in NV mode, and 26.4 degrees C in AC mode on all data. Chennai had slightly higher comfort temperature. We found an adaptive relationship between the prevailing outdoor temperature and the comfortable indoor temperatures. Most of the environments in NV mode and about half in AC mode were warmer than the current Indian Standard upper limit (26 degrees C).
   In most cases, the air speed was below 0.20 m/s. Most of the subjects used fans. Air speeds of 1 m/s increased the comfort temperature by 2.7 K in both the modes. Logistic regression predicted 87% and 50% fan usage at 29 degrees C in NV and AC modes respectively. Several factors prevented further thermal adaptation. We can potentially improve comfort and reduce air-conditioning by providing higher air speeds with energy-efficient fans. Such strategies may be vital given the scale of the scarcity of power.

AB  - Utah prairie dogs (Cynomys parvidens) have been extirpated in 90% of their historical range. Because most populations in Utah occur on private land, this threatened species is continually in conflict with landowners. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has been relocating Utah prairie dogs from private to public land since the 1970s, but relocations have been largely unsuccessful because of high mortality. Utah prairie dogs are highly social animals, but they are usually relocated without regard to their family group, or coterie. We predicted that relocating Utah prairie dogs with other coterie members would improve their survival rate and result in post-release behavior similar to non-relocated animals. We chose to investigate release-site retention as a measure of relocation success because we were unable to separate emigration from mortality. We relocated Utah prairie dogs from the Cedar Ridge Golf Course in Cedar City, Utah to 2 prepared sites near Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah in 2010 and 2011. We relocated prairie dogs as groups of coterie members or in a control group of individuals trapped with no regard to relatedness. Two months after relocation, we set traps to recapture animals to estimate release-site retention. We quantified activity budgets prior to and following relocation on study animals as well as from a previously established relocated prairie dog population on public land. The best predictor of release-site retention and recapture rate was the animal's weight at initial capture. Larger animals had high retention but low recapture rates. We found no differences in site retention or behavior between prairie dogs relocated with coteries and controls. Relocated individuals behaved more like prairie dogs on public lands than animals in the urban source population, but behaviors were still different from prairie dogs on public lands. We recommend relocating large, adult Utah prairie dogs rather than juveniles or relocating juveniles later in the trapping season to increase relocation success rate. We also suggest that future research should focus on developing additional release methods to reduce dispersal and increase site retention. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Background: Despite doubts about methods used and the association between vector density and dengue transmission, routine sampling of mosquito vector populations is common in dengue-endemic countries worldwide. This study examined the evidence from published studies for the existence of any quantitative relationship between vector indices and dengue cases.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: From a total of 1205 papers identified in database searches following Cochrane and PRISMA Group guidelines, 18 were included for review. Eligibility criteria included 3-month study duration and dengue case confirmation by WHO case definition and/or serology. A range of designs were seen, particularly in spatial sampling and analyses, and all but 3 were classed as weak study designs. Eleven of eighteen studies generated Stegomyia indices from combined larval and pupal data. Adult vector data were reported in only three studies. Of thirteen studies that investigated associations between vector indices and dengue cases, 4 reported positive correlations, 4 found no correlation and 5 reported ambiguous or inconclusive associations. Six out of 7 studies that measured Breteau Indices reported dengue transmission at levels below the currently accepted threshold of 5.
   Conclusions/Significance: There was little evidence of quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used for outbreak prediction. This review highlighted the need for standardized sampling protocols that adequately consider dengue spatial heterogeneity. Recommendations for more appropriately designed studies include: standardized study design to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission; adult mosquito sampling should be routine; single values of Breteau or other indices are not reliable universal dengue transmission thresholds; better knowledge of vector ecology is required.

AB  - In light of the abstract theorizations of scholars of transnational social movement networks-as exemplified by Hardt and Negri's Multitude-in this paper I argue for the power of grounded, material engagements with the practices of protest of social movements to transform not just political spaces, but our theoretical landscapes. I compare the practice of setting up and maintaining encampments in the Oaxaca and Occupy movements to argue that the spatial dynamics of occupation in a tent city fuels the distinctive style of participatory politics of the assembly, providing a creative means to transform confrontation into cooperation. A point of departure for this comparison is my assertion that the political difference made by these social movements lies not just in whether or not they achieved their political goals, but in the kind of intervention that the physical fact of occupying a public space entails in normative understandings of politics and public spaces.

AB  - In many parts of the world, once large and continuous forests have been replaced by a mosaic of isolated forest fragments embedded in an agricultural or urban landscape matrix. At the same time, stand characteristics such as tree population size and tree density have been strongly modified as a result of anthropogenic activities. Because increased geographical isolation can impede gene flow among forest fragments, and because decreased population size and tree density may reduce the number of local mating partners, this can be expected to lower the opportunity to trees for outcrossing, and to result in increased inbreeding, negatively impacting the viability of fragmented tree populations. In this study, we examined eight isolated stands of the wind-pollinated tree species Q. robur that strongly differed in population size, tree density and spatial isolation. In the centre of each Q robur stand, adult leaves and seeds were collected in a circular plot, in which we evaluated the diversity and differentiation of the local pollen pool, and examined mating patterns. Most forest stands showed high proportions of out-of-plot pollen flow (range: 0.24-0.77), which were positively correlated with the number and density of adult trees within the forest stands. Despite high outcrossing rates (>0.998), seeds within seed families were stronger related than what could be expected under panmixia, which could be attributed to small but significant levels of correlated paternity (0.018-0.107) and biparental inbreeding (0.025-0.118) within the study plots. Next to increased coancestry coefficients, deviations from random mating also resulted in significant pollen pool differentiation (0.008-0.059) among seed parents. We also found that stand population size and tree density were significantly correlated to the relatedness of the seedlings and the degree of pollen differentiation within the study plots. These results suggest that, in small and isolated low density forest stands, reduced mate availability may decrease local pollen pool diversity, increasing the likelihood of consanguineous mating and pollen pool differentiation in the next generations. We conclude that preserving high levels of pollen flow within and between forest fragments may be more important in wind-pollinated tree species than what was previously thought.

AB  - This paper center-stages the canonization of two key figures of Slovenian poetry, each of the early nineteenth century: Valentin Vodnik and France Preeren, and the placement of their statues in the public space of Ljubljana, capital of the Habsburg province of Carniola. Late in the nineteenth century, monuments to "cultural saints" became an important symbolic battlefield for the Slovenian national movement, striving for greater cultural and political autonomy. More broadly understood, Ljubljana turns out to be a paradigmatic example of how the literal battle for the nationalization of the city was fought through the occupation of public space by statues of "great men of literature." The struggle, then, adopts semiotic significance. The Carniolan capital would eventually become a spiritual metropolis of "Slovenedom," densely sown with far-reaching monumental symbols.

AB  - Analysis of a driver's head behavior is an integral part of a driver monitoring system. In particular, the head pose and dynamics are strong indicators of a driver's focus of attention. Many existing state-of-the-art head dynamic analyzers are, however, limited to single-camera perspectives, which are susceptible to occlusion of facial features from spatially large head movements away from the frontal pose. Nonfrontal glances away from the road ahead, however, are of special interest since interesting events, which are critical to driver safety, occur during those times. In this paper, we present a distributed camera framework for head movement analysis, with emphasis on the ability to robustly and continuously operate even during large head movements. The proposed system tracks facial features and analyzes their geometric configuration to estimate the head pose using a 3-D model. We present two such solutions that additionally exploit the constraints that are present in a driving context and video data to improve tracking accuracy and computation time. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough comparative study with different camera configurations. For experimental evaluations, we collected a novel head pose data set from naturalistic on-road driving in urban streets and freeways, with particular emphasis on events inducing spatially large head movements (e. g., merge and lane change). Our analyses show promising results.

AB  - Although well studied in coastal ecosystems, comparatively little information exists on the ecology of inland Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) populations, particularly at the periphery of their range. Our specific objectives were to estimate home-range area and assess did (i.e., day vs. night) habitat-selection patterns of an urban, inland American Alligator population at the northwestern edge of the species' range. During 2010-2011, we captured 14 (6 female, 5 male, 3 unknown sex) American Alligators, 9 (5 female and 4 male) of which were fitted with VHF transmitters. Mean home range (95% kernel) was 68.9 ha (SD = 31.6) and 40.9 ha (SD = 20.7) and the mean core area (50% kernel) was 20.6 ha (SD = 18.5) and 10.1 ha (SD = 6.6) for males and females, respectively. American Alligators primarily selected river channels and open-canopy shorelines during both day and night. The amount of emergent or floating vegetation and canopy cover in a particular habitat influenced the probability of selection by American Alligators but this probability was dependent on the did l time period. During the day, the probability of selection was higher in areas with emergent or floating vegetation and more canopy cover, whereas at night the probability of selection decreased with increasing canopy cover. American Alligators did not select open water at either the study-area level or within the home range, which may have been due at least in part to the presence of recreational boaters or differences in food availability between open-water areas and other areas occupied by American Alligators on the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge. Overall, the results of our study are largely incongruent with patterns of home-range size and habitat selection reported for the species elsewhere, suggesting that further study of other American Alligator populations at the periphery of the distribution range is warranted.

AB  - We live in a contested, crisis-prone era, indicative of ongoing processes of neoliberalization. The most recent global financial and food crises have disproportionately impacted those already marginalized in society: people of colour and the working classes. The spatial expressions of this disproportionality are especially acute, evidenced by the uneven distribution of the basic necessities of food and home. Activists in the USA are responding with forms of spatial citizenship, namely exercising their right to peaceably assemble and reclaiming public spaces. During the creation of spaces of dissent, we observe the fluid formation of a collective spatialized identity among social movement actors, contingent on political identities and ideology. We use two cases based in Florida to highlight these processes. The first case is a local iteration of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Occupy Gainesville, which has occupied the city's most central public gathering place, the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The second case involves Food Not Bombs in the city of Orlando where attempts were made to ban the group from distributing food in public parks to the homeless and working poor. First, these cases highlight the spatiotemporal relationships between unjust economic systems and the state surveillance and policing apparatus and those resisting such systems. Second, they reveal how collective identity influences and in turn is influenced by space. Our article furthers a processual, dynamic understanding of activist mobilizations to reduce the uneven burdens of neoliberalization and argues for greater attention to the spatialities of contentious politics.

AB  - This paper describes demographic changes resulting from devastating natural disasters in which at least half of the community's structures suffered major damage or total destruction. Considering 92 US communities that suffered disasters (mainly from hurricanes, river flooding, and tornadoes) between 1992 and 2008, locations that were already experiencing declining populations before their disaster were most likely to experience large post-disaster population losses. Communities suffering severe flooding were most likely to lose over a third of their population. Population movement typically occurred regardless of whether the community formally relocated. Small communities were particularly at risk of losing population following destruction, particularly when they lacked schools. Communities with higher home vacancy rates before their devastation were significantly more likely to experience large population declines. Wealthier communities and those located nearer metropolitan cities were most likely to retain their populations following major destruction, yet overall pre-disaster home values and median incomes in the communities were well below national averages. Race and Hispanic population were not significantly related to post-disaster population change in the overall study.

AB  - In the modern society, ultra high-rise buildings gradually prevails in large cities, but they are always suffering severe losses in fire, terrorist attacks and other emergencies so that the problem of ultra high-rise building evacuation has become a new hot spot area. In this paper, by the simulation software AnyLogic, which is based on the social force model, an evacuation process in the stairwell which occupies an important position in ultra high-rise building evacuation is simulated, therefore many factors involved in ultra high-rise building evacuation are studied, including the slope gradient of stairs, evacuation speed, and so on. In addition, the effects of these factors are investigated and some appropriate recommendations are made. By studying the personnel density fluctuation of the evacuation process, the corner and stair areas on each floor are regarded as the priorities for research, and then the movements of personnel and the effects of influence factors in both two regions are separately analyzed and compared. Finally several characteristics of personnel evacuation process in ultra high-rise building are found.

T2  - GEOTECHNICAL ASPECTS OF UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION IN SOFT GROUND
LA  - English
CP  - 8th International Symposium on Geotechnical Aspects of Underground Construction in Soft Ground (IS-Seoul)
AB  - Tunnels for the new Barcelona Metro Line 9 are being constructed in a densely built urban area, close to sensitive structures. The paper presents a case history involving tunnelling in difficult mixed geological conditions below an existing Metro Line (Line 4). Tunnelling was performed with a dual EPB boring machine and the closed mode of operation was prescribed beneath all sensitive structures. Despite this original prescription, an open mode excavation (with a partially filled pressure chamber) had to be adopted to avoid the interruption of the boring process in the area below the existing Metro Line 4. The paper describes the geological conditions of the site, presents some of the ground movement observations prior to the change of excavation mode and discusses the rationale that allowed the change in the prescribed tunnelling mode as well as the results obtained. Observations of displacements during the excavation in open mode confirmed that no soil inrush into the head chamber occurred and that in addition, with the new excavation procedure, ground movements were reduced significantly.

AB  - A geomorphologic and morphometric analysis was performed to determine the characteristics of the de La Flecha river basin, located in the southwest of San Juan province (31A degrees 50'S, 68A degrees 57'W), Precordillera of San Juan. The drainage networks were derived from shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM), satellite imageries (Landsat TM and Spot image) and field works. The paper also addresses a preliminary evaluation of the flood hazard responsible for severe damage to people and infrastructure in the downstream region. The study area covers about 300 km(2), comprising of six sub-watersheds, ranging from 31.7 to 81.8 km(2). The irregular morphology of the basin and the diversity of alluvial deposits found along the de La Flecha river allow the authors to infer that it is in an active tectonic environment with strong lithological and structural controls. One feature common to all analyzed sub-basins is their elongated shape, which allows for a rapid concentration of water that intensifies the power of the flash floods. The drainage network in the different sub-basins has, in general, two predominant patterns; one is parallel to sub-parallel to the headers and foothill areas; and the other, in the alluvial zone, is divergent. Los Berros, Caada Honda and Media Agua towns, located downstream of the basin, are the most affected by flash floods coming from the mountainous area.

AB  - Society responds to changes in climate and land use via mitigation measures, including rainwater retention and storage in rewetted and newly constructed wetlands. Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50 m and 50 km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25 m and 6 km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56 m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6 km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities.

AB  - The need to examine the entire scope of everyday activities of individuals in segregation studies has recently been recognized by social scientists and policy makers. To bring forth new insights into ethnic segregation through investigating the activities and movement undertaken by different population groups, we used mobile phone positioning data to compare the activity spaces of out-of-home nonemployment activities over a one-year period in Estonia and abroad. The results show that ethnicity has a significant influence on the activity spaces of individuals. The biggest differences between the two population groups occur in Estonia outside the respondents' home city of Tallinn, where the Russian-speaking minority was found to visit 45 percent fewer districts than Estonians. Moreover, they exhibit a preference for districts that are more heavily populated by a Russian-speaking population. With respect to international travel, the Russian-speaking minority visits fewer countries and are 3.6times more likely to visit former Soviet Union countries than Estonians. The activity spaces of out-of-home nonemployment activities have fewer differences between the two groups in the respondents' home city of Tallinn. Overall, our results show that ethnic differences have less effect on the everyday activity space and a greater influence on the choices made regarding long-distance travel. ??????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????, ????????????, ????????, ????????????????????????????????, ????????????????????????, ???????????, ??????????????????, ?????????, ??????????, ????????????????, ?????????????????????????, ?????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ?????????, ???????????????????, ?????????????? Recientemente se ha reconocido por cientificos sociales y hacedores de politicas la necesidad de examinar en estudios sobre segregacion todo el espectro de las actividades cotidianas de los individuos. Con la intencion de generar nuevo entendimiento en la segregacion etnica al investigar las actividades y movimiento emprendidos por diferentes grupos de poblacion, usamos los datos posicionales de los telefonos moviles para comparar los espacios de actividad utilizados para el desempeno de oficios extra-hogarenos no asociados con empleo durante un ano, en Estonia y en el extranjero. Los resultados indican que la etnicidad tiene una influencia significativa sobre los espacios de actividad de los individuos. En Estonia, las mas grandes diferencias entre los dos grupos de poblacion ocurren por fuera de Tallin, ciudad de los entrevistados, donde se descubrio que la minoria ruso-parlante visitaba 45 por ciento menos distritos que los estonianos. Mas aun, aquellos muestran una preferencia por distritos que estan mayoritariamente habitados por una poblacion hablante de ruso. Respecto a viajes internacionales, la minoria hablante de ruso visita menos paises y tienen 3.6 veces de mayor probabilidad que los estonianos de visitar paises de la antigua Union Sovietica. Los espacios de actividad en oficios fuera del hogar no asociados con un empleo tienen menores diferencias entre los dos grupos en la ciudad de residencia de los entrevistados, Tallin. En general, nuestros resultados muestran que las diferencias etnicas tienen menos efecto sobre el espacio de actividad cotidiano y una influencia mas grande sobre las escogencias hechas en relacion con viajes de larga distancia.

AB  - Adult Lymantria dispar japonica (females only) and Lymantria mathura (both sexes) flew to commercial lighting during the night in Takizawa Village, Iwate Prefecture, Japan, in large numbers during the first week of August 2008. Males of L. d. japonica were conspicuously absent while 93.8% of responding females were mated and subsequently laid an average of 419.2 eggs each post-flight. For L. mathura females, only 33.9% were mated during the first half of the night and each mated female carried on average 717.4 eggs (max. 1065). Egg counts were facilitated by a newly developed egg mass matrix digestion process and an approximation of egg count based on egg mass dry weight was calculated. These two moth species have dissimilar behavioral strategies-L. d. japonica is diurnal, mated during the afternoon pre-flight and females flew to the lighting after mating. In contrast, L. inathura is nocturnal and both sexes responded to the lighting; females generally arrived as virgins (unfertilized) to then mate with males as the night progressed. Lack of a moth flight in 2009 illustrated dramatic interannual population fluctuation prevalent among many lymantriine moths. An illustration of a 2013 mass flight in Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, suggests a more frequent occurrence of such flights in both lime and space.

AB  - The objective of the study was to characterize the daily feeding activity patterns of Saanen goats (Capra hircus) as a function of changes in climatic variables. The investigation was conducted in the municipality of Cruzeta, 300 km from the city of Natal, Brazil. Seventeen free-ranging female Saanen goats were selected for observation, wherein they were kept on a pasture with native vegetation and also received concentrated feed in a trough. Observational records of behavior on pasture were collected using focal animal and scan sampling for these specific behaviors: ruminating while standing or lying down, standing idly or lying down, walking, grazing and eating. Eating was the predominant activity observed. The frequency of some behaviors changed in accordance with certain climatic variables, with behaviors that require more active movement occurring in the morning hours, when temperatures are milder, exhibiting higher frequencies. These observations indicate that animals adjust their daily activities in order to minimize the effects of the stress caused primarily by environmental conditions.

AB  - Background: Group A Rotaviruses are a major etiologic agent of gastroenteritis in infants and young children (, 5 years) worldwide. Although rotavirus vaccines have been successfully administered in many countries, in India the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in national immunization program was approved in 2014. Since high disease burden and large number of genetic variants have been reported from low income countries including India, monitoring of rotavirus was initiated prior to implementation of the vaccine in the region.
   Methods: A total number of 3,582 stool samples were collected from an urban slum community in Kolkata, among which 1,568 samples were obtained from children of <= 5 years of age, with moderate to severe diarrhoea and 2,014 samples were collected from age-sex matched healthy neighbourhood controls. Rotavirus positive samples were typed by multiplex seminested PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Circulating strains were phylogenetically analyzed.
   Results: Among 1,568 children with diarrhoea, 395 (25.2%), and among 2,014 asymptomatic children, 42 (2%) were rotavirus positive. G1P[8] was identified as the most common strain (32%) followed by G9P[8] (16.9%), G2P[4] (13.5%) and G9P[4] (10.75%). G12 strains with combinations of P[4], P[6] and P[8] comprised 11.9% of total positive strains. The rest (<10%) were rare and uncommon strains like G1P[4], G1P[6], G2P[8] and animal-like strains G4P[6], G6P[14] and G11P[25]. The 42 rotavirus positive samples from asymptomatic children revealed common genotypes like G1, G2 and G9.
   Conclusion: This community based case-control study showed increased predominance of genotype G9 in Kolkata. It also confirmed co-circulation of a large number of genetic variants in the community. Asymptomatic rotavirus positive children though low in number can also be a source of dispersal of infection in the community. This study provides background information to the policy makers for implementation of rotavirus vaccines in this region.

AB  - A review of lynxes' reproductive biology and comparison between the reproductive cycles of the domestic cat and lynxes is presented. Three of the four lynx species (the bobcat excluded) express quite similar reproductive pattern (age at sexual maturity, estrus and pregnancy length, litter size). Similarly to the domestic cat, the bobcat is polyestric and can have more than one litter per year. Domestic cats and many other felid species are known to express anovulatory, pregnant and pseudo-pregnant reproductive cycles in dependence on ovulation induction and fertilization. The formation of corpora lutea (CLs) occurs after ovulation. In pregnant animals, luteal function ends with parturition, whereas during pseudo-pregnancy a shorter life span and lower hormone secretion are observed. The life cycle of corpora lutea in Eurasian lynxes is different from the pattern described in domestic cats. Lynx CLs produce progestagens in distinctive amounts permanently for at least two years, regardless of their origin (pregnancy or pseudo-pregnancy). It is suggested that long-lasting CLs induce a negative feedback to inactivate folliculogenesis, turning a normally polyestric cycle observed in most felids into a monoestric cycle in lynxes.

AB  - Romania's current territorial development, the new spatial structure of the economy and the population are mostly determined - besides the process of path dependency - by new political, social and economic circumstances. With the transition from a planned to a market economy, the post-communist socio-economic changes have left their mark on the evolution of the rural population not just in terms of structure and quality, but also in terms of numbers. Deindustrialization and the restructuring processes that occurred in the late 1990s have had a negative effect that manifested itself not only in the rise of unemployment, but also in the directional change of the internal migration. The main objective of the paper is to show how the spatial pattern of migration flows has changed during two time periods: between 1990 to 1996, when the internal movement of people was characterized by rural-urban migration and 1997 to 2011, when - due to the economic restructuring processes - urban-rural migration has prevailed. To interpret this, the paper focuses on assessing the current state and the spatial differentiation of migration in Romania - based on settlement level data, regardless of the spatial conditionality of the phenomenon - using the technique of spatial autocorrelation. The aim is to establish and interpret the different clusters resulting from the similarities in the intensity of the net migration rate, as well as to compare the outputs of these two results. The analysis mostly focuses on the effects of economic change on the internal migration, regardless of aspects related to the emigration of the Romanian population.

AB  - The HSPF-Paddy model was applied to the Bochung watershed in Korea to compare water budget components by the land use types under the Asian monsoon climate. The calibration of HSPF-Paddy during 1992-2001 with PEST, a package program to optimize HSPF, and validation during 1985-1991 were carried out. The model efficiencies for monthly stream flow are 0.85 for calibration and 0.84 for validation. The simulation of annual mean runoff met the criteria of water budget analysis with the acceptable error level (less than 10 percent mean error). The simulation of the movement of water from paddy rice field to watershed was successful, and application of HSPF-Paddy coupled with PEST was able to improve accuracy of model simulation with reduced time and efforts for model calibration. The results of water budget analysis show that most of the outflow (86%) for the urban area occurred through surface runoff, showing the highest rate among the land use types compared. Significant amounts of water are irrigated to paddy rice fields, and the runoff depth as well as evapotranspiration from paddy rice field is higher than other land use types. Hydrological characteristic of paddy rice field is that most of water movement occurred at the surface area, resulting from the low infiltration rate and manning's coefficient, as well as ponded water throughout the growing season. Major impact on input and output of water were precipitation and runoff, respectively, influenced by an Asian monsoon climate.

KW  - Isfahan historic bridges
KW  - Khajoo Bridge
AB  - Continuation of experiences in the historical Iranian architecture used to traditionally pass from one generation to the next. The application of such experiences, when facing new requirements and situations, was a platform for a rebirth of new works, which were generally accepted by the society. Isfahan's historic bridges are examples of the development of such processes which reached their peak during the Safavid era. This thrive, with building of new bridges and restoring old ones, happened as a result of economical prosperity and growth in Isfahan, which was the capital of Iran during the Safavid era. Khajoo bridge, among all others, has a different form and characteristics and these differences raise questions about the formation of this bridge. This is based on the accepted concepts and experiences noted in the construction of other bridges at that time. Examples include common traditions and ideas taken into account in other bridges. Primarily, the present research studies the characteristics of Khajoo Bridge that have made it stand out among all other bridges and as well as the features that have led to the creation of a new set of behavioral and physical characteristics in the building. In order to find the appropriate answers to these questions, the researchers have focused on three basic architectural systems: function, physic and structure. By studying and comparing historic bridges in Isfahan with other bridges in Iran, it seems obvious that the success and the importance of these bridges can be best characterized by these basic architectural systems. It should be noted that these three systems are associated with Vitruvius three rules (effectiveness, stability and beauty). The meaning of function in this research is related to the way the bridges were connected to the city, how they fitted in to the urban fabric, and how they communicated with the network of access points connected to the entrance and exit of the city. It is also important to identify the roles of the bridge and their special incorporated services since the bridges were not only built for transit purposes but they have also had other functions, as well. The bridges have been used across history as a dam, a defense structure and as a space where people could gather, meet and socialize. They have also been used for channeling the water and helping with rotation of water mills, controlling waterways, and obtaining merchandise taxes. The purpose of analyzing physical form of the bridges is to identify the architectural result of function and what would become a shell, structure and shape of the building. This part of discussion includes the investigation on the division of the facade, plan and identification of corresponding areas. Also structural system in this research means analyzing skeletal structure and transition of forces. The approach of this study is basic. The method of research is descriptive-analytical. The research data has been gathered through library sources and field observations. In this way, various traditions of building bridges in the region according to historical precedence were studied through the mechanism of comparative and mostly qualitative research. In discussing the function, Khajoo Bridge similar to Shahrestan, Marnan and Allahverdykhan bridges, created connections to southern towns and villages. Also, during the construction period of Khajoo Bridge, the Zoroastrians were living in the adjacent neighborhood and this bridge connected this religious community to the city.
   Prior to that, there was a similar role identified between Marnan Bridge and the Armenian community. On the other hand, Khajoo Bridge has a defined beginning and an end, attempting to connect citizens to Takhtefoolad. This property existed in Allahverdikhan Bridge (Dolatkhaneh Safavi to Hezarjarib) and Jooei Bridge (North gardens to Sadaatabad Garden and Ayenekhaneh and Haftdast palaces). In addition to its transmission role, Khajoo Bridge like Shahrestan, Marnan and Allahverdikhan Bridge had the role of a gateway to the city. Another function that was especially associated with this bridge was becoming the dam. Another feature is having different spaces in its different parts. This property is affected by the concern to accommodate the presence of human in the space of architectural designs. Such characteristic of the bridge began to take form with the creation and integration services. These spaces can also be found in Rahdarkhaneh in Shahrestan Bridge, Saqqakhaneh in Marnan and Allahverdikhan Bridge. Such attention to human presence in space, specifically in Khajoo Bridge, has been made by Combination Bridge with pavilion; creating eastern stairs, and platforms between arches and recreational space for the pedestrians. In discussing the physical form (body), the evolution of non-geometric and organic bridge (Shahrestan Bridge) to geometric bridge (Khajoo Bridge) has been highlighted in the present research. Among these bridges only Allahverdikhan and Khajoo Bridge have two level aspects with eastern and western facades due to their porous porches. In terms of division plans and facades, Khajoo Bridge has evolved as a sample for the bridges in the region specifically for its emphasis on the early, the middle and the end of the body. When discussing the structure of the bridge, it is interesting to note that a design that had been used to make candle foundation in Marnan Bridge continued and evolved in Allahverdikhan and Khajoo Bridge. Another feature is the transmission of forces in Khaoo Bridge which is very similar to Allahverdikhan Bridge with some differences in the lower levels. In fact, in Khajoo Bridge the lower platform occupies much more surface that leads to a better transmission of forces. In the end, the continuity of traditions in shaping the form of Khajoo Bridge has been detected. The results thereof are based on specific principles like the continuity of common traditions, as well as the conditions and the needs of the community. Identifying these can possibly be effective in applying conservation methods, as well as creating and giving life to architectural work, specifically to bridges.

T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - IMPORTANCE Encephalitis mediated by anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies and herpes simplex (HS) encephalitis are seemingly separate causes of encephalopathy in adults and children. Herpes simplex encephalitis is infectious, and anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis is autoimmune in origin. Both can cause seizures and encephalopathy, although the latter can also cause psychiatric symptoms and movement disorders. Owing to the rarity of these 2 diseases, patients with co-occurrence are important because they alert clinicians to possible links between 2 seemingly separate processes.
   OBSERVATIONS In a case series of 2 patients observed at our center, we describe an infant and an adult who had confirmed HS encephalitis and then developed confirmed anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis. Polymerase chain reaction testing for HS virus was performed. Testing for NMDA receptor antibodies was performed by Associated Regional and University Pathologists Laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We conclude that atypical cases of HS or other viral encephalitides should be investigated for concomitance of an autoimmune encephalitis. We suspect that the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which HS virus infects neurons produce a higher likelihood of contracting anti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis.

AB  - Aim Many factors facilitate biological invasions, making it difficult to determine their relative importance, especially when relying on survey data that include confounded variables. Incorporating information about species characteristics can improve inferences drawn from species-environment relationships, which can inform management. We seek to understand why the abundance of exotic, and not native, terrestrial plants is higher in riparian wetlands most impacted by flow regulation.
   Location River Murray, SE Australia.
   Methods We use variance components analysis and hierarchical generalised linear models to examine whether the positive relationship between flow regulation and proportional cover of exotic plants is driven by altered hydrological regimes, wetland drying and drought, superior colonisation ability of exotic species following disturbance or human-increased propagule pressure.
   Results Of the four hypotheses, hydrological modification (indicated by flood magnitude) most likely drives invasion. Flow regulation may inhibit native species adapted to the historical hydrological regime, facilitating exotic species with different environmental ranges. A symptom of environmental change, invasion may have been exacerbated by drought, although it is unclear why. There was no indication that human-increased propagule pressure or colonisation ability facilitated invasion. Exotic cover was unrelated to proximity to towns, recent flood frequency and cattle grazing intensity. Additionally, similar proportions of exotic and native species were used in cultivation and, despite a higher proportion of exotics being known weeds, weed status was unrelated to exotic species occupancy. Overall, colonisation ability was unrelated to species' origin or response to water depth and hydrological change. Although exotics had higher specific leaf area and shorter longevity (indicative of higher colonisation ability), they had heavier (not lighter) seeds and did not differ in height from natives.
   Main conclusions Using environmental flows to reinstate mid-range floods and augmenting the propagule supply of native species with characteristics suitable for modified conditions may help limit invasion in these wetlands.

AB  - AimThe geographical expansion of white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) in North America has attracted the attention of biologists and sportsmen because of their recreational and aesthetic value; however, data on factors driving the spatial spread of this species are lacking. We examined spatial and temporal patterns of range expansion for white-winged doves along the northern edge of their geographical range from 1979 to 2007 and used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate when and where doves would be found along an expansion gradient.
   LocationSouthern half of the USA.
   MethodsWe modelled spatial variation in the range expansion of white-winged doves from 1979 to 2007 using data from the North American Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) and distance from initial population centre, area of urban land cover, and ecoregion. We used a robust design occupancy analysis to estimate species expansion rate based on a model set grounded in broad-scale conditions likely to drive dove distribution. We evaluated our best fitting model (using Akaike's information criterion adjusted for small sample size) by comparing estimates to actual observations in 1993 and 2007 using area under the curve (AUC) metrics from receiver-operating characteristic plots.
   ResultsOur spatial distribution model indicated that range expansion of white-winged doves was primarily influenced by distance from the core population centre, with additive effects of ecoregion and land cover. In 1979, white-winged doves were present in 12% of survey locations, whereas presence increased to 41% by 2007. Across all ecoregions, urban land cover was positively related to probability of occupancy. We evaluated our model for 1993 and 2007 by comparing derived occupancy estimates to sightings of white-winged doves within our sample hexagons using BBS survey data. Based on high AUC statistics (>0.85), we concluded that our model was useful for accurately predicting range expansion.
   Main conclusionsEstimating occurrence and range expansion of white-winged doves and other expanding/invasive avian species at large spatial scales can be effectively conducted using BBS data. Using these nationwide, long-term survey data to relate expansion to a suite of conditions likely to drive population dynamics is an effective approach to developing predictive models of range expansion.

AB  - Hybrid zones, where phenotypically distinct populations interbreed, should expand or contract until reaching a balance between selection and dispersal. Few studies examine multiple contacts within one species complex to compare how their extent changes over time. Black-crested and Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus atricristatus and B. bicolor) hybridize extensively within a narrow zone in Texas and southwestern Oklahoma. In Texas, hybridization has been occurring for several thousands of years, while evidence suggests the southwestern Oklahoma contact is more recent, beginning within the past century. We quantify plumage and morphology of the two species across both the younger and older hybrid zones and compare the current and historical extent of phenotypic variation in the older Texas contact with that in the younger Oklahoma contact. Variation in plumage between species is similar in the younger and older contacts, while overlap in morphological characters is broader in the older contact. Recently and historically surveyed transects in the older zone have similar cline widths, indicating selection, at least on crest and forehead plumage, has reached equilibrium with dispersal over the time periods involved (comparing both the historically surveyed data from 1955 vs. the recently surveyed data from the 2000s in Texas). In the recently surveyed younger Oklahoma contact, cline width is narrower, indicating potential for expansion if it follows the course of the older contact. This temporal complexity should make this species complex a productive system for future work, using plumage and additional traits such as song and genetics, on the relative influences of both natural and sexual selection on the evolution of reproductive isolation.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)-vehicle collisions (DVCs) are increasing as human and deer populations continue to grow. Deer harvest was implemented at Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee (ORR) in 1985 to reduce DVCs. We assessed the relationship between DVCs at ORR to deer harvest, road type, and habitat features (forest, field, water, and developed cover types) during 1986-2008 using Poisson regression analysis and Akaike Information Criterion modeling. We also evaluated DVC numbers for the city of Oak Ridge and ORR during 1975-2008 to examine the effects of moon phase, employee work-shift timing, and season on DVCs. From 1975 to 2008, 4,637 DVCs occurred in Oak Ridge and ORR, with monthly DVCs peaking each November. Most DVCs occurred at the start of the workday. Annual DVC totals peaked at 273 in 1985; deer harvest was then implemented and DVCs declined. No harvest occurred in 2001 and DVCs increased for the next 2 years. A model including harvest, road type and distance, development, and water features received full support for explaining DVC occurrence. Harvest in the previous year was positively related to DVCs, likely reflecting higher hunter success with higher deer density. Higher traffic volume and speed were positively related to DVCs. There was no effect of moon phase for all records combined; however, analysis by season and gender showed a positive relationship to collisions for male deer during the gestation period (1 Jan-14 May), which may have been associated with dispersal. We recommend continued deer harvest and driver education to reduce DVCs. (C) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Background: Dengue is a vector-borne disease in the tropical and subtropical region of the world and is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. In the state of Amazonas, Brazil during the 2011 outbreak of dengue all the four Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes circulating simultaneously were observed. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical epidemiology of dengue in Manaus, the capital city of the state of the Amazonas, where all the four DENV serotypes were co-circulating simultaneously.
   Methodology: Patients with acute febrile illness during the 2011 outbreak of dengue, enrolled at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Viera Dourado (FMT-HVD), a referral centre for tropical and infectious diseases in Manaus, were invited to participate in a clinical and virological descriptive study. Sera from 677 patients were analyzed by RT-nested-PCRs for flaviviruses (DENV 1-4, Saint Louis encephalitis virus-SLEV, Bussuquara virus-BSQV and Ilheus virus-ILHV), alphavirus (Mayaro virus-MAYV) and orthobunyavirus (Oropouche virus-OROV).
   Principal Findings: Only dengue viruses were detected in 260 patients (38.4%). Thirteen patients were co-infected with more than one DENV serotype and six (46.1%) of them had a more severe clinical presentation of the disease. Nucleotide sequencing showed that DENV-1 belonged to genotype V, DENV-2 to the Asian/American genotype, DENV-3 to genotype III and DENV-4 to genotype II.
   Conclusions: Co-infection with more than one DENV serotype was observed. This finding should be warning signs to health authorities in situations of the large dispersal of serotypes that are occurring in the world.

TI  - Observations of a stratospheric aerosol veil from a tropical volcanic eruption in December 1808: is this the Unknown similar to 1809 eruption?
T2  - CLIMATE OF THE PAST
LA  - English
AB  - The Unknown eruption of 1808/1809 was the second most explosive SO2-rich volcanic eruption in the last two centuries, eclipsed only by the cataclysmic VEI 7 Tambora eruption in April 1815. However, no eyewitness accounts of the event, and therefore its location, or the atmospheric optical effects associated with its aerosols have been documented from historical records. Here we report on two meteorological observations dating from the end of 1808 that describe phenomena we attribute to volcanic-induced atmospheric effects caused by the Unknown eruption. The observations were made by two highly respected Latin American scientists. The first, Francisco Jose de Caldas, describes a stratospheric aerosol haze, a "transparent cloud that obstructs the sun's brilliance", that was visible over the city of Bogota, Colombia, from 11 December 1808 to at least mid-February 1809. The second, made by physician Jose Hipolito Unanue in Lima, Peru, describes sunset after-glows (akin to well-documented examples known to be caused by stratospheric volcanic aerosols) from mid-December 1808 to February 1809. These two accounts provide direct evidence of a persistent stratospheric aerosol veil that spanned at least 2600 km into both Northern and Southern Hemispheres and establish that the source was a tropical volcano. Moreover, these observations confirm that the Unknown eruption, previously identified and tentatively assigned to February 1809 (+/- 4 months) from analysis of ice core sulfate records, occurred in late November or early December 1808 (4 December 1808 +/- 7 days). This date has important implications for the associated hemispheric climate impacts and temporal pattern of aerosol dispersal.

AB  - This paper presents an application example of the use of the Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar technique (DInSAR) for monitoring ground movements in a geologically complex area around the village of Suria (Ebro Basin, Catalonia, NE Spain), associated to underground mining activities and to the presence of a salt dome.
   The analysis has been mostly performed in a rural environment affected by ground movements with different patterns, magnitudes and causes. A total of fifty SAR images recorded between 1995 and 2007 were processed to generate the interferograms. In order to study the non-linear trends or changes of the ground surface behavior, the DInSAR technique was applied in two sets of images.
   The interferometric results, in the form of vertical displacement rate maps, were checked against conventional surveying and GPS measurements. The results present a significant discrepancy in some location due to the wrapping of the phase when both fast and significant deformations occur. In order to avoid the latter effect and improve the accuracy of the results, all SAR images were reprocessed using topographic leveling and GPS data of different monitored points.
   To support the DInSAR interpretation, a detailed geological reconnaissance of the study area was carried out as well as an inventory of ground movement indicators. Four different patterns of ground movement have been identified: active shifting subsidence associated to the progression of the mining exploitation fronts; residual subsidence on abandoned galleries with a decreasing rate of closure; uplifting due to the intrusion of the salt dome; and sudden ground collapses (sinkholes) caused by the dissolution of soluble materials laying close to the ground surface.

T2  - REVUE DE L ART
LA  - French
AB  - Royal residence from Louis XI to Francois I-er,I- the Chateau d'Amboise was, for the most part, built between 1463 and 1498. The unusual size of this undertaking attracted highly qualified workers who developed new architectural and decorative models. The city financial archives deliver information, for the most part unpublished, about the movement of the contractors between the royal building site and the municipal building sites. In 1475, the name of Martin Chambiges appears simultaneously in both records. He was occupied with repairing a bridge. The name of Simon Duval also appears designated as "maistre des euvres du roi a Amboise" (master of the king's works in Amboise). The two architects can be found in the 1490s in Paris where they take part in monumental renovation. Under Charles VIII, Amboise still served as a professional springboard for a generation of brilliant master stonecutters brought there by Colin Biart. Their productions, up to Chambord in the 1520s, bear witness to a tradition of technical excellence and sculptural refinement from the middle of the 15115 century in the Val de Loire, as well as the essential place this region played in the flourishing of the French Flamboyant Gothic style.

AB  - This article intends to analyze some of the social changes in England in the last decades of the Eighteenth century from the poem in London that is in the work Songs of Innocence and of Experience of the poet and engraver William Blake an author inserted in the English Romantic movement. His work has been marked, as a whole, by mystical thought culminating in the creation of a cosmogony able to explain, according to the author, the human condition. We can notice in the poems of William Blake his vision about the time in which he lived, his interpretation of reality can elucidate some of the experiences of English society in the transition between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries: that was part of the process of industrialization, the increasing displacement of reason as center of thought and heard the echoes of the French Revolution. Songs of Innocence and of Experience contains the foundations of thought developed over the later works of William Blake expresses social transformations he lived in a universe where politics, religion and art intertwine in building a peculiar interpretation of the formation of modern industrial society.

AB  - The aim of this research was to define the effect of the construction and renovation of a highway bypass around the town of Skepe on the environment and assemblages of carabid beetles. This four-year study was based on catching samples of beetles using pitfall traps. The traps were set first in 2008 and later from 2010 to 2012, after the renovation of the road, along roadside verges adjacent to two ca. 100-year-old pine forest stands, wet habitats and fallows of arable fields and inside these habitats about 25 m from the road (control plots). The carabids collected were identified to species and numbers of individuals and dominance values of each of the species were calculated for each study plot and each year. Furthermore, the dominance of the different species of plants was assessed. Numbers of species, numbers of individuals, percentage share of forest species and individuals, and Shannon diversity values of the carabid assemblages were analyzed. Multivariate statistical analyses (ordinations) were carried out using the dominance of the different species of carabids and using the ecological indicator values of plants as environmental factors. The construction of the bypass in 1987 resulted in more diversified carabid assemblages along the roadsides. Carabid fauna along the roadsides differed from that in the control plots in forests and in terms of some parameters from the control plots in wet habitats, but not statistical from the control plots in the fallow areas of arable fields. The renovation of the road 22 years after construction did not result in any significant changes in the characteristic parameters of the carabid assemblages along the roadsides, but gradient analysis indicated that it did have an effect. In terms of the environmental conditions of the habitats based on the plant associations occurring there the roadside habitats differed from the control plots in forests and wetlands. Since the number of sites studied is rather low, the results of this study have to be considered to be preliminary, but may provide research hypotheses for further research on highway roadsides.

TI  - Occupying Umlazi: Hesitant Steps Towards Political Ideology in a Durban Township
T2  - POLITIKON
LA  - English
AB  - Umlazi is considered the second most populated African township in South Africa, after Soweto. Located in southwestern Durban, Umlazi has long been a site of community movements, especially during apartheid. Umlazi's Ward 88 was a site of political revival in 2012, a time when ideas unified people and motivated them to pursue a common goal. The name of those ideas was 'Occupy', following a film screening of the 2011 Occupy movement. There are a variety of lessons from assessing several weeks of protest marred by state violence, followed by a Ward Committee election won by the Occupy movement, followed by uneven access to development resources. The ebb and flow of ideology is one such lesson: it is a necessary part of moving from local to global, to address both deep problems and the politicians who sustain them.

LA  - Dutch
AB  - Giving a detailed account of the social history of The Hague's most prominent sites of civilised leisure - the gentlemen's clubs, the zoo, the Royal Theatre and the seaside resort of Scheveningen - Plaatsen van beschaafd vertier demonstrates how the constant struggle for social in- and exclusion structured the daily lives of upper and middle class men and women in The Hague in the nineteenth century. In response to Bart Van de Putte, Jan Hein Furnee argues that extensive quantitative analyses of 'class' and 'social class' show that objective class stratifications based on wealth and/or occupation are important tools, but at most semi-finished products for historical research. Furnee fully agrees with Henk de Smaele's objection that his study would have benefitted from a more in-depth reflection on the ways in which shifting patterns in women's freedom of movement in urban spaces were related to their political and economic emancipation. In response to Dirk Jan Wolfram, Furnee repeats some examples given in his book that show how political practices in places of leisure impacted upon local and national politics, even though this did not directly contribute to a linear process of increasing political participation and representation.

   Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight PD patients were involved and examined by the movement disorder specialist using several scales including Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II and III, Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS). The exons 8 and 9 of GBA was sequenced and screened for variants.
   Results: The GBA variants were found in 16 (11.6%) PD patients: N370S mutation in 5 (3.6%) and T369M variant in 11 (7.9%). No significant differences between the group of mutation carriers and non-carriers were found in relation to clinical features except for dementia (MMSE score < 26) occurring more often in N370S mutation carriers (60.0% vs 19.6%, p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: The N370S GBA mutation is the risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients. (C) 2014 Polish Neurological Society. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o. All rights reserved.

AB  - The claim that the settlements in the West Bank are gated communities might seem trivial. Those settlements are an explicit example of a community featuring, on the one hand, social cohesion based on shared values, while, on the other hand, self-isolation with the help of fences and a stress on the 'security of the community'. The argument of this paper, however, is different. The paper suggests that the settlement layout in the West Bank is not just an aggregate of 124 'legal' gated communities and a similar number of 'illegal outposts', but rather a single, contiguous gated community gating, in turn, Palestinian 'islands' within it. The reading I will offer seeks to look at the space in question through a careful reading of its use values. The emphasis is put on the question of mobilities in order to show how the fortressed points turn into an exclusionary web by means of separated roads and movement restrictions. By analysing the combined system of settlements, roads, military legislation, spatial design and applied violence, the paper shows how the few hundred points consolidate into one coherent spatial system. The paper wishes to contribute to the spatial analysis of the now 45-year-old Israeli occupation of the West Bank, to the growing study of politics of mobility and to the discourse of gated communities by adding colonialism and violence to the mostly neoliberal explanations of the phenomenon.

AB  - Refugia can affect predator-prey dynamics via movements between refuge and non-refuge areas. We examine the influence of a refuge on population dynamics in a large mammal predator-prey system. Wolves (Canis lupus) have recolonized much of their former range in North America, and as a result, ungulate prey have exploited refugia to reduce predation risk with unknown impacts on wolf-prey dynamics. We examined the influence of a refuge on elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolf population dynamics in Banff National Park. Elk occupy the Banff townsite with little predation, whereas elk in the adjoining Bow Valley experience higher wolf predation. The Banff refuge may influence Bow Valley predator-prey dynamics through source-sink movements. To test this hypothesis, we used 26 years of wolf and elk population counts and the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit five predator-prey models: 1) with no source-sink movements, 2) with elk density-dependent dispersal from the refuge to the non-refuge, 3) with elk predation risk avoidance movements from the non-refuge to the refuge, 4) with differential movement rates between refuge and non-refuge, and 5) with short-term, source-sink wolf movements. Model 1 provided the best fit of the data, as measured by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In the top model, Banff and Bow Valley elk had median growth rates of 0.08 and 0.03 (95% credibility intervals [CIs]: 0.027-0.186 and 0.001-0.143), respectively, Banff had a median carrying capacity of 630 elk (95% CI: 471.9-2676.9), Bow Valley elk had a median wolf encounter rate of 0.02 (95% CI: 0.013-0.030), and wolves had a median death rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.146-0.335) and a median conversion efficiency of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.031-0.124). We found little evidence for potential source-sink movements influencing the predator-prey dynamics of this system. This result suggests that the refuge was isolated from the non-refuge.

AB  - Land use change results from frequent, independent actions by decision-makers working in isolation, often with a focus on a single land use. In order to develop integrated land use policies that encourage sustainable outcomes, scientists and practitioners must understand the specific drivers of land use change across mixed land use types and ownerships, and must consider the combined influences of biophysical, economic, and social factors that affect land use decisions. In this analysis of two large watersheds covering a total of 1.9 million hectares in Maine, USA, we co-developed with groups of stakeholders land use suitability models that integrated four land uses: economic development, ecosystem protection, forestry, and agriculture. We elicited stakeholder knowledge to: (1) identify generalized drivers of land use change; (2) construct Bayesian network models of suitability for each of the four land uses based on site-level factors that affect land use decisions; and (3) identify thresholds of suitability for each factor and give relative weights to each factor. We then applied 12 distinct Bayesian models using 99 spatially explicit, empirical socio-economic and biophysical datasets to predict spatially the suitability for each of our four land uses on a 30 m x 30 m pixel basis across 1.9 million hectares. We evaluated both the stakeholder engagement process and the land use suitability maps. Results demonstrated the potential efficacy of these models for strategic land use planning, but also revealed that trade-offs occur when stakeholder knowledge is used to augment limited empirical data. First, stakeholder-derived Bayesian land use models can provide decision-makers with relevant insights about the factors affecting land use change. Unfortunately, these models are not easily validated for predictive purposes. Second, integrating stakeholders throughout different phases of the modeling process provides a flexible framework for developing localized or generalizable land use models depending on the scope of stakeholder knowledge and available empirical data. The potential downside is that this can lead to more complex models than anticipated. The trade-offs between model rigor and relevance suggest an adaptive management approach to modeling is needed to improve the integration of stakeholder knowledge into robust land use models.

AB  - Resource selection by animals influences ecological processes such as dispersal, reproduction, foraging, and migration. Little information exists regarding foraging resource selection by bats during the maternity season. We evaluated support for effects of landcover type, landform, and landscape pattern on resource selection by individual foraging female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) during the maternity period and compared resource utilization for all individuals pooled (population level), individuals grouped by geographic location, and individuals grouped by stage of lactation (early, mid, and late). We used a resource utilization function (RUF) to relate landcover and landscape attributes to the utilization distributions of individual bats estimated by the fixed-kernel method. We radio-tracked 64 lactating red bats and estimated utilization distributions for 52 individuals. Mean home range size ranged from 1,041 to 1,588 ha from late to mid lactation. The global RUF model was significantly better than the null RUF model for 36 (70%) individuals and the magnitude and direction of coefficients varied among individuals. Resource utilization at the population level was, on average, positively related to ridges and upland drainage landforms, water landcover, and road density; and negatively related to urban and nonforest landcover and distance to edge. Resource use differed between geographic areas by canopy cover, water landcover, and road density. Canopy closure was positively related to RUF in both areas but was greater in the south area. Percent water negatively related to RUF in the north area and positively related in the south area. Road density had a positive relationship in the north and negative relationship in the south with RUF. We did not find a difference in mean RUF coefficients among lactation groups except for canopy cover. On average, canopy cover had a positive effect on use by bats during early and mid-lactation but a negative effect during late lactation. We suggest that management for red bats consider landscape components and provide a range of composition and structural diversity to enhance foraging use by red bats. In highly forested landscapes, gaps or openings may provide forest edges that are important for foraging and commuting. Published 2014. This article is a U. S.

AB  - A spatial interaction model to predict anthropogenically- initiated accidental and incendiary wildfire ignition probability is developed using fluid flow analogies for human movement patterns. Urban areas with large populations are identified as the sites of global influencing factors, and are modeled as the gravity term. The transportation corridors are identified as local influencing factors, and are modeled using fluid flow analogy as diffusion and convection terms. The model is implemented in Arc-GIS, and applied for the prediction of wildfire hazard distribution in southeastern Mississippi. The model shows 87 % correlation with historic data in the winter season, whereas the previously developed gravity model shows only 75 % correlation. The normalized error for convection- diffusion model predictions is about 5 % in the winter season, whereas the gravity model shows an error of 7 %. The proposed model is robust as it couples a multi-criteria behavioral pattern within a single dynamic equation to enhance predictive capability. At the same time, the proposed model is more costly than the gravity model as it requires evaluation of distance from intermodal transportation corridors, transportation corridor density, and traffic volume maps. Nonetheless, the model is developed in a modular fashion, such that either global or local terms can be neglected if required.

AB  - Since their entry to Japan in the latter half of the 19th century, coffee and coffee shops have been closely linked to the economic, political, and socio-cultural change undergone by the Japanese society. The cafes themselves have gone through numerous transformations in order to address the various social needs of their patrons. Today, coffee shops occupy a significant niche in the Japanese urban lifestyle. However, the cultural baggage' of coffee as a foreign commodity still plays a central role in generating its consumer appeal. Coffee is a global commodity whose value on the world market is surpassed only by oil. Moreover, due to its peculiar historical background, it became a beverage charged with a wide range of cultural meanings; tracing these meanings in different contexts can shed light on the way cultural commodities behave' in the globalized world. In order to examine the niche that coffee occupies in the Japanese consumption scene, I will analyze the manner in which representations of coffee are constructed and translated into a consumer experience. Through the case of coffee in Japan I will try to demonstrate the process of movement of culture', whereby the relevance of a foreign commodity in the local context is determined by the complex interplay between two culturally engineered binary entities of global' and local', foreign' and native'.

AB  - There is a growing concern about continued impairment of aquatic ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a 100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area. Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment facilities by the 1960s. Climate trends during the 100-year period indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the mid-1980s and 90s invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly altered the ecological. structure and function of the lake. Waterborne illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being; and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case study for the larger Great Lakes region.

AB  - This study had two objectives: firstly, to assess and compare the frequency and circumstances of agitation and, secondly, to generate decision-making aids for the treatment of agitation patients by applying a nursing intervention in cases of dementia and agitation. For that purpose, 1002 measurements of open nursing interventions in cases of agitation were obtained over a period of 11 weeks in two nursing homes in the city of Zurich and in the nursing home Sonnweid. Before, during and after two intervention periods of four weeks each, data were collected for 60 persons suffering from severe dementia. The results show that two-thirds of the residents were never agitated, one-quarter was moderately agitated and only very few suffered from medium-to-severe agitation. In almost half the cases, agitation occurred while the person was alone (46%), followed by cases of agitation as a constant state (26%). There was rarely any agitation while the residents were engaged in activities. After analysing 433 documented cases, it turned out that the most successful care interventions were avoiding noise, accompanying the person to the toilet, communication/validation, walking about/movement and administering beverages. Being based on newly translated observational methods and a unique longitudinal study design with combined intervention, this study provides important insights into how agitation in dementia can be influenced within the care context, as well as a practical evaluation of interventions specific to different institutions.

AB  - The Rif mountains of Morocco still occupies a place of choice in the history books and even in the. ulama' milieu of the Qarawiyin in Fez. Names like those of Ibn Mashish, al-Habti and Ibn. Ardun continue to feed a medieval historical tradition still alive today. These names bring us back to a time when the Ghmara country, as it was called at the time, was a cultural center that rivaled the city of Fez. Ibn Mashish and his disciple al-Shadhili, both initiators of the famous tariqa shadhiliyya, started from this mountain a religious reform movement that had a tremendous following among mountain populations, such as those of the throughout Morocco. On the other hand, the Ghmara fuqaha', gatekeepers between ulama' and the common people, were trying to explain the Islamic standards to people who barely knew Arabic. The fewer. ulama' of the Jbel, more versed in legal and religious knowledge, shared between the network of the Andalusian religious science before 1492 and that of Fez, worked to shape the Maliki thought and to build it according to the requirements of their moutainous environment. To understand this phenomenon, this paper aims to follow the trajectories of the main reformers of awliya' Sufis and principal holders of knowledge ('ulama'), and to measure the impact of these attempts to reform Ghmara society.

AB  - Background: In the Decree of the Minister of Health on the National Immunisation Movement Acceleration Universal Child Immunization 2010-2014 (GAIN UCI 2010-2014) stated that the general problems of decline in immunization coverage and quality of service were caused by several things, one of which is the lack of quantity, quality and distribution of human resources. Methods: A cross-sectional mix-method study to investigate human resources in vaccine management had been conducted in two provinces in 2012. Primary data were collected by interviewing stakeholders thoroughly, secondary data collection and observation were also carried out. Analysis was done by scoring for data concerning education, length of employment, training experience and knowledge. Result: The number of Vaccine management officers are still lacking. While the immunization guidelines required minimal two officers for each health centers. Officers' knowledge in primary health centers is still inadequate, especially in terms of the vaccine and Coldchain (Ice Lined Refrigerators). Officers at Provincial Health Office had been trained in vaccine management, but not all officers at District Health Office and Primary Health Centers had received training yet. Suggestion: This study suggests the addition of the quantity and quality of human resources in vaccine management, because the officers can affect the quality of the vaccines, because vaccines need a special handling to maintain the quality to provide immunity and prevent the occurrence of diseases that can be prevented by immunization (PD3I).

AB  - Social media have both enabled and reinforced a shift towards the personalization of politics and collective action that is also occurring in China. In addition to street actions, the country is seeing a continuously growing number of so-called online mass incidents. While they have been attracting growing scholarly attention, most analyses have been based on anecdotal evidence and have treated netizens as a uniform group without evaluating the event's internal discursive dynamics. In order to assess such micro-blogging incidents' actual potential for political change, we investigate the case of the largest online mass incident' in China since the advent of Chinese micro-blogging services in 2009, prompted by the crash of two high-speed trains near the city of Wenzhou in July 2011. Drawing on the systematic content analysis of more than 4600 micro-blog posts published in the aftermath of the accident, we analyse the events' discursive dynamics, focusing on the composition, transformation, and radicalization of claims and targets. Our analysis demonstrates that the level of radicalism of the Wenzhou online mass incident is rather moderate and that no radicalization took place before the debate levelled down. While the incident significantly enhanced the tendency in Chinese online activism towards the broadening of the critical debate on national affairs, expectations about a democratizing impact of online debates might be premature.

AB  - Earthquake is one of the most destructive natural hazards which pose a real threat to India with nearly 59% of its geographical area vulnerable to seismic disturbance of varying intensities including the capital city of the country. India has experienced several major earthquakes mainly in Himalayan region and is also considered as one of the most earthquake prone regions in the world. Therefore, during past few decades, the Himalayan region has been studied extensively in terms of present ongoing displacements. It can be believed that a better estimate of the current Himalayan convergence rate and possible rupture can improve seismic hazard evaluations. Moreover, an improved convergence rate is also necessary to estimate if any slip deficit is available to drive future earthquakes in this region. In recent years, SAR interferometry has been successfully used for generating large scale surface displacement maps in radar look direction on a dense grid and with a centimeter to millimeter accuracy. In this context, the usefulness of SAR interferometry technique and its variations for estimation of displacements has been studied and presented in this paper. To study the displacement both conventional and multi-temporal Differential SAR interferometry has been used. In order to get the 3-D surface displacement, interferogram from both ascending and descending track can be used. However, due to the unavailability of ascending track data, a well-known mathematical model also has been used. Overall average displacement rates in the present study are found to be relatively lower as compared to the reported convergence rates. From geophysical point of view, the results presented in this paper for a small area are quite promising. Several explanations have also been presented in this paper to support the results. The reported low convergence rate may be due to the occurrence of silent/quite earthquakes, aseismic slip, differential movement of Delhi Hardwar ridge, etc. Therefore, in view of the contemporary seismicity and conspicuous displacements, a study of long-term observations of this surface movement has been recommended in future.

AB  - In the 1964 general election, the English town of Smethwick outside Birmingham became infamous for the unprecedented way in which issues of immigration, race and racism entered British national politics. Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths captured the Smethwick seat in Parliament from long-standing Labour MP Patrick Gordon Walker, aided by the slogan 'If you want a nigger neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour'-a watershed episode soon overshadowed by the rise of Powellism in the late 1960s. Debates between Griffiths, his supporters and his opponents in the early to mid-1960s about the local and national implications of 'coloured' immigration (particularly of Indian Sikhs) from the Commonwealth and the legacy of empire drew upon a densely entangled set of global reference points that went beyond a 'multi-racial' Britain being reshaped by its 'multi-racial', postcolonial Commonwealth. Racist rhetoric, as well as an increasingly assertive anti-racist activism by the Indian Workers' Association and other groups, turned to analogies ranging from Nazi Germany to apartheid South Africa and racial segregation in the United States, as well as to protest techniques inspired by Gandhi in colonial India and African Americans in the civil rights movement. In Smethwick c. 1964, the global met the local, illuminating transnational flows of people and ideas about race and cultural diversity nonetheless contingent upon their time and place.

AB  - Background and purpose: Coherence changes can reflect the pathophysiological processes involved in human ageing. We conducted a retrospective population study that sought to analyze the age-related changes in EEG coherence in a group of 17,722 healthy professional drivers.
   Materials and methods: The EEGs were obtained using a standard 10-20 electrode configuration on the scalp. The recordings from 19 scalp electrodes were taken while the participants' eyes were closed. The linear correlations between the age and coherence were estimated by linear regression analysis.
   Results: Our results showed a significant decrease in coherence with age in the theta and alpha bands, and there was an increasing coherence with the beta bands. The most prominent changes occurred in the alpha bands. The delta bands contained movement artefacts, which most likely do not change with age.
   Conclusions: The age-related EEG desynchrony can be partly explained by the age-related reduction of cortical connectivity. Higher frequencies of oscillations require less cortical area of high coherence. These findings explain why the lowest average coherence values were observed in the beta and sigma bands, as well as why the beta bands show borderline statistical significance and the sigma bands show non-significance. The age-dependent decrease in coherence may influence the estimation of age-related changes in EEG energy due to phase cancellation. (C) 2014 Polish Neurological Society.

AB  - Background: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is characterized by much diversity in terms of geography, society, economic development, and health outcomes. The health systems as well as healthcare structure and provisions vary considerably. Consequently, the progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in these countries also varies. This paper aims to describe the progress toward UHC in the ASEAN countries and discuss how regional integration could influence UHC.
   Design: Data reported in this paper were obtained from published literature, reports, and gray literature available in the ASEAN countries. We used both online and manual search methods to gather the information and 'snowball' further data.
   Results: We found that, in general, ASEAN countries have made good progress toward UHC, partly due to relatively sustained political commitments to endorse UHC in these countries. However, all the countries in ASEAN are facing several common barriers to achieving UHC, namely 1) financial constraints, including low levels of overall and government spending on health; 2) supply side constraints, including inadequate numbers and densities of health workers; and 3) the ongoing epidemiological transition at different stages characterized by increasing burdens of non-communicable diseases, persisting infectious diseases, and reemergence of potentially pandemic infectious diseases. The ASEAN Economic Community's (AEC) goal of regional economic integration and a single market by 2015 presents both opportunities and challenges for UHC. Healthcare services have become more available but health and healthcare inequities will likely worsen as better-off citizens of member states might receive more benefits from the liberalization of trade policy in health, either via regional outmigration of health workers or intra-country health worker movement toward private hospitals, which tend to be located in urban areas. For ASEAN countries, UHC should be explicitly considered to mitigate deleterious effects of economic integration. Political commitments to safeguard health budgets and increase health spending will be necessary given liberalization's risks to health equity as well as migration and population aging which will increase demand on health systems. There is potential to organize select health services regionally to improve further efficiency.
   Conclusions: We believe that ASEAN has significant potential to become a force for better health in the region. We hope that all ASEAN citizens can enjoy higher health and safety standards, comprehensive social protection, and improved health status. We believe economic and other integration efforts can further these aspirations.

AB  - Objective. Prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative (GN) bacteria is increasing globally and is complicated by patient movement between acute and long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In Asia, the contribution of LTCFs as a source of MDR GN infections is poorly described. We aimed to define the association between residence in LTCFs and MDR GN bloodstream infections (BSIs).
   Design. Secondary analysis of data from an observational cohort.
   Setting. Two tertiary referral hospitals in Singapore, including the 1,400-bed Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the 1,600-bed Singapore General Hospital.
   Participants. Adult patients with healthcare-onset (HCO) or hospital-onset (HO) GN BSI.
   Methods. Patients were identified from hospital databases using standard definitions. Risk factors for both MDR GN HCO and HO BSI were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model.
   Results. A total of 675 episodes of GN BSI occurred over a 31-month period. Residence in a LTCF was an independent risk factor for developing MDR GN BSI (odds ratio [OR], 5.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-11.9]; P < .01) when antibiotics were not used within the preceding 30 days. This risk persisted beyond the first 48 hours of hospitalization (OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.3-9.0]; P = .01). Previous culture growing an MDR organism (OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; P < .01), previous antibiotic use (OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]; P < .01), and intensive care unit stay (OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]; P = .01), increased the risk of MDR GN BSI.
   Conclusions. Residence in a LTCF is an independent risk factor for MDR GN BSI. Attempts to contain MDR GN bacteria in large Asian cities, where the proportion of the population that is elderly is projected to increase, should include infection prevention strategies that engage LTCFs.

AB  - Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most destructive pest of potato in many countries of the world. It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8 degrees C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan. Results of this study suggest that it is essential to strengthen inspection and quarantine measures to prevent any artificial transmissions of Colorado potato beetle spreading eastward and thus to ensure the sustainable production of potato and other Solanaceae crops in northwest regions of China.

AB  - On 12 May 2008, an M(w)7. 9 earthquake occurred on the Longmenshan fault system at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau near Wenchuan City. Here we obtained the ionospheric perturbations in Japanese ALOS/PALSAR images covering the epicenter of Wenchuan earthquake from the corresponding azimuth offsets, and determined highly precise and continuous InSAR surface displacements using those that are not strongly affected by ionospheric perturbations. Combing with the GPS coseismic deformation, a joint model considering both coseismic and postseismic phases is constructed to study the coseismic slip distribution of the Wenchuan earthquake and the viscous structure of the Longmenshan region. The best-fitting slip model suggests that the earthquake is an event with very complex fault rupture. The slips of Hongkou, Yuejiashan, Beichuan, and Hanwang segments are dominated by the thrust movement and the Qingchuan segment experiences a dominant right-lateral strike slip. The major slip occurred mainly at the depth of less than 10 km, with a maximum slip, of 10. 7 m on the northeastern Hongkou segment. The determined geodetic moment is approximately 9. 28 X 10(20) N . m (M(w)7. 91), which is consistent with the results of seismology. The mid to lower crustal viscosity derived from the joint model in a Maxwell half-space is 2X10(18) Pa . s, which places a strong low bound on viscosity in the Longmenshan region. Postseismic displacements time series covering a longer time span might have the potential to improve this constraint.

AB  - Organizational development has been a movement that emerged after 1962 as an educational mechanism that attempts tomodify the structures, beliefs and values of individuals within organizations, since the groups are inevitably subject to a process of rapid change in all areas (College of Bachelors, 2005). Moreover, this is the result of organizational change that emerges froman identified need, which occurs in the interest of changing a management strategy focused on processes or goals, improve organizational climate, transform culture, and reduce the impact of processes of division or business fusion and among other aspects, the effective participation of its members in organizational goals. It is for this reason that the role of human capital in all processes of organizational change is framed within a analysis vision, anticipate and potentiate behavior, as well as internaldynamic relations, knowledge and the what to make of people in context. The main purpose of this study is to understand how the processes of training and competences development became key to the organizational transformation in companies in Bogota City, from the viewpoint of the leaders of Human Resources managers. The methodology is based on an exploratory - descriptive study with a co relational goal as it seeks to reach even better understanding of the phenomenon being studied. To this end the design and implementation was performed through the design and application of semi-structured interviews and surveys as tools for data collection, by which intentional results sampled 81 companies in Bogota that developed models for staff development. The expected result is to identify how these programs have become a key factor for organizational development.

AB  - Objective: to identify the prevalence and intensity of chronic pain among elderly people of the community and to analyze associations with the self-perceived health status. Method: cross-sectional study with a populational sample (n=934), conducted through household interviews in the city of Goiania, Brazil. The intensity of chronic pain (existing for 6 months or more) was measured using a numerical scale (0-10) and the self-perceived health through a verbal scale (very good, good, fair, poor, very poor). For the statistical analysis, the absolute frequency and percentage, CI (95%), Chi-square test, Odds ratio, and regression analysis were used. Significance of 5%. Results: The prevalence of chronic pain was 52.8% [CI (95%):49.4-56.1]; most frequently located in the lower limbs (34.5%) and lumbar region (29.5%); with high or the worst possible intensity for 54.6% of the elderly people. The occurrence of chronic pain was associated with (p<0.0001) a worse self-perception of health (OR=4.2:2.5-7.0), a greater number of chronic diseases (OR=1.8:1.2-2.7), joint disease (OR=3.5:2.4-5.1) and the female gender (OR=2.3:1.7-3.0). A lower intensity of chronic pain was associated with a better self-perception of health (p<0.0001). Conclusion: the majority of the elderly people of the community reported chronic pain, of a severe intensity, and located in areas related to movement activities, thus influencing the morbidity and mortality of this population.

AB  - Where does and should the future of libraries lie? What were once concrete, brick, and glass structures have since become a third place where community, art, and culture reside. What is next? The #searchunderoccupy exhibit in the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center in New York City is a 'living archive' that visually displays the creative and critical responses of the New School's student community to the Occupy Wall Street movement. It is composed not only of elements such as video, photographs, audio and performance projects, but also text-based works such as live feed tag clouds, posters, and blogs. By their very nature, libraries are poised to become forces for social change and using this exhibit as an example, libraries themselves can show the life of their communities by putting their responses on display to support their involvement in social movements, engage others, and document for the future. There are many iterations of the living archive in libraries such as the digitization of audio-visual materials or allowing people to share their memories, knowledge, photos and opinions through a virtual space. The closest to the #searchunderoccupy exhibit example is capturing the activities and conversations of designer William McDonough for the Stanford University libraries. Unlike these projects, the New School's method allows for a greater range of self-expression through visual mediums and accounts for the technology of today. Social media is what has helped spread the social movements of the current generation and with its ever-changing nature, this version of a living archive presents a future library full of infinite possibilities.

AB  - Electromagnetic fields (EMF) permeate the built environment in different forms and come from a number of sources including electrical wiring and devices, wireless communication, 'energy-efficient' lighting, and appliances. It can be present in the indoor environment directly from indoor sources, or can be transmitted through building materials from outside sources. Scientists have identified it as an indoor environmental pollutant or toxin that has ubiquitously plagued developed nations causing a variety of adverse health effects such as sick-building syndrome symptoms, asthma, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, leukemia, electro-hypersensitivity (EHS), behavior disorders, and more. There is currently no international consensus on guidelines and exposure limits. This paper presents the results of 29 EMF field audits in single family residential dwellings located within an urban neighborhood in Toronto (Canada). The following EMF spectra were evaluated: radio frequency, power frequency electric fields, power frequency magnetic fields and high frequency voltage transients. The field audits were conducted in order to provide initial baseline statistics to be used in future studies and in order to be compared to a low-cost EMF reduction design incorporated within the Renovation2050 research house - located within the test neighborhood. The results show the low-cost reduction strategy to be effective, on average reducing exposure by 80% for high-intensity EMF metrics. Research of this nature has not been conducted with relation to the built environment and can be used to spark an industry movement to design for low-exposure to EMF in a residential context.

AB  - On condition of anthropogenic pressure soil biota is one of the first reacting on environment changes. As long as natural selection occurs by phenotypes, it is important that on the urban land the organisms' adaptations to changes in natural factors can be revealed with phenetic methods. The paper analyzes the ecological modification of the diplopoda Rossiulus kessleri (Lohmander, 1927) in the Samarskyi Forest region environment (Novomoskovskyj forestry is the ravine ecosystem, and Kocherezhskyi forestry is short-term-flooded ecosystem) and State Reservation "Voloshanskaya Dacha" ("Zatishnoye"). Such investigation for this region is conducted for the first time. Space samples consisted of 30 individuals (males and females, proportionally) for each plot Among others, 14 basic morphometric in-line parameters and its relation were chosen: length/width of the body, amount of segments, length of hindleg, length of telson, length/width of antenna, length/width of gnathochilarium, length/width of semiflosculous blades, length/width of promenthum, length of collum. Morphometric interconnections within the given populations were established with the help of the factor analysis. The most changeable morphometric characteristics between populations and sexes were revealed. For all the given populations sex dimorphism is pointed out for the size of gnathochilarium and the length of collum. Basing on obtained results from specimen measuring from Novomoskovsky forestry district we pointed out that both the majority of the given in-line parameters and its relation had no sex dimorphism. It also shows the stability of the environment. It is estimated that females from Kocherezhskyi forestry population have longer antennae (males have 10,2% less) and body width (females are on 14,0% wider). Body width is stable characteristic for many Diplopoda species. With high signification level for both basic in-line characters (length and width), sex dimorphism is observed in the conditions of the State Reservation "Voloshanskaya Dacha" ("Zatishnoye" stow). ANOVA-test of the given data showed that two different groups existed. Specific characters for individuals with dispersal index 19,2% are extensive body parameters. Spatial population structure clearly distinguishes males from the general sample. Data obtained illustrates the anthropogenic pressure and can be used to monitor populations.

AB  - Cerebral Palsy (CP) describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the brain development of the fetus or infant. The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behavior, by epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems (Rosem baum, Paneth, Levinton, Goldstein and Bax, 2007, p. 9). The Boccia is an exclusive sport for people with disabilities (cerebral palsy) in a wheelchair, but it has been created a category reserved for the physically disabled. Its goal is to leave balls of the same color closest to the target or white so that gain points. It can be played individually or by pairs or teams, and for this there is a special classification. (Bernal Ruiz, 2010). The ground must be flat and smooth like a gym floor tile or wood. The surface must be clean; it has dimensions of 12.5 mx 6 m. The launch area is divided into six boxes of release. For this study analyzed 233 photographs from the location of the white ball of the every match of individual categories, in order to define the tendency of the location of the White ball during the National Championship Interleague in the City of Cartagena in 2013. For the analysis of data from the field was divided into 9 equal squares starting at the apex end of the V line, taking into account the rules for the release of the white bowl (Diana) as a valid throw. Among of the 233 photographs that were analyzed we noted that quadrants 1 and 2 with 44, 3 with 40 and 5 with 43 pitches were most used for launches of White ball and the section 9 was the least used with 1 launch.

AB  - The pipe-jacking method is a kind of efficient trenchless technology to install pipelines, especially for the pipeline going through the downtown of the city or the rivers. As the important part of the water supply project in Xiamen, two steel pipes with 2.2m diameter would be installed to cross the strait between Xiamen Island and the mainland. Considering the navigation channel in the strait, complicated stratums in site, and construction techniques and costs, the pipe-jacking method is adopted. Since the longitudinal stiffness of the steel jacking pipes is relatively lower than that of the reinforced concrete jacking pipes, the upheaval deflection is more likely to occur on the steel pipes with small buried depth. In this study, the upheaval deflection of the steel jacking pipes in the soft soil seabed is analyzed and controlled. The total jacking distance from #2 working well to #5 working well in this project is 816 m. During the jacking stage, obvious upheaval deflection occurs in the part under channel area, in where the buried depth of pipes is only 2.96m (i.e. 1.3D). Such upheaval movement also affects the adjacent pipe sections, which causes that the total upheaval length of pipe is about 260 m. Considering the geological condition and influence of the wave, the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis is carried out to investigate the major factors causing the upheaval deflection. Result shows that the resistance of soil is too small to offset resultant upward forces. Furthermore, the jacking force will contribute to the increase of upheaval after the upward deflection occurs. Therefore, surcharging method is proposed to reduce the upward deflection of the steel jacking pipes. The field measurement shows that the deflection of steel pipes decreased after loading in pipes. This study will provide the beneficial reference for the design and the construction of the steel jacking pipes in soft soil seabed.

The event occurred after adverse weather conditions that produced a ground displacement of several meters, causing a severe emergency situation. The analysis has shown the presence of two main directions of motion: a major and a minor movement along the South-SouthWest and South-SouthEast directions. The pixel-offset results are well in agreement with both the magnitude and the deformation mechanisms that have been identified and mapped during field observations.

AB  - Objectives: Stimulants may worsen psychotic symptoms but there is limited evidence about the impact of stimulant abuse in people with schizophrenia. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of stimulant and other drug disorders in a population-based sample of people with schizophrenia, examining associations with frequent service use, physical health comorbidities and accommodation instability.
   Methods: New South Wales (NSW) hospital, community mental health and emergency department data were used to examine health service contact over 5 years in 13,624 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Associations of stimulant disorders were examined with nnultinomial logistic regression, comparing people with no substance disorders to those with cannabis disorders, stimulant disorders or both.
   Results: Of people with schizophrenia, 51% had substance disorders, including 14% with stimulant disorders. Stimulant disorders were more common in young adults and in urban areas, less common in migrants, and unrelated to initial social disadvantage. More than 80% of those with stimulant disorders also had cannabis disorders. Service use and harms were most common in this group, including frequent mental health admissions (59%), frequent emergency department presentations (52%), admissions with injury or self-harm (44%), infectious disease diagnoses (22%), multiple changes of residence (61%), movement to more disadvantaged locations (42%) and periods of homelessness (18%). People with stimulant disorders alone had higher rates of self-harm, infectious disease and non-mental health admissions than people with cannabis disorders alone.
   Conclusions: Stimulant disorders occur in people with schizophrenia and in first-episode psychosis at rates more than 10 times that of the broader population. Stimulant disorders are likely to worsen the burden of psychosis, and strategies are needed to engage and support the highly disadvantaged group of people with schizophrenia who have cannabis and stimulant disorders.

AB  - Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and exist in gas and particle phases, as well as dissolved or suspended in precipitation (fog or rain). While the hydrosphere is the main reservoir for PAHs, the atmosphere serves as the primary route for global transport of PCBs. In this study, fog and rain samples were collected during fourteen events from September 2011 to April 2012 in the Xistral Mountains, a remote range in the NW Iberian Peninsula. PAH compounds [especially of low molecular weight (LMW)] were universally found, but mainly in the fog-water samples. The total PAH concentration in fog-water ranged from non-detected to 216 ng . L-1 (mean of 45 ng . L-1), and was much higher in fall than in winter. Total PAH levels in the rain and fog events varied from non-detected to 1272 and 33 ng . L-1 for, respectively, LMW and high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs. Diagnostic ratio analysis (LMW PAHs/HMW PAHs) suggested that petroleum combustion was the dominant contributor to PAHs in the area. Total PCB levels in the rain and fog events varied from non-detected to 305 and 91 ng . L-1 for, respectively, PCBs with 2-3 Cl atoms and 5-10 Cl atoms. PCBs, especially those with 5-10 Cl atoms, were found linked to rain events. The occurrence of the most volatile PCBs, PCBs with 2-3 Cl atoms, is related to wind transport from far away sources, whereas the occurrence of PCBs with 5-10 Cl atoms seems to be related with the increase of its deposition during rainfall at the end of summer and fall. The movement of this fraction of PCBs is facilitated by its binding to air-suspended particles, whose concentrations usually show an increase as the result of a prolonged period of drought in summer.

AB  - Context Animals carrying tracking and logging devices are subject to a range of instrument effects that negatively affect survival, reproduction and behaviour. The common recommendation is that device weight should not exceed 5% body mass (BM) for terrestrial species; however, this rule-of-thumb has little empirical basis. Modelling indicates that devices weighing less than 3% BM may still have impacts. Several studies have used telemetry and data loggers on domestic cats (Felis catus) with instruments ranging in weight from 30g to 125g, but there has been no quantitative evaluation of instrument effects. In addition, inexpensive GPS tags such as iGotU are increasingly being used to track domestic cats, but often with little acknowledgement of habitat-related location error.
   Aims We evaluated the impact of wearing devices of different weights on domestic cat movements, and quantified location error across typical suburban habitats.
   Methods We recorded movements of cats wearing three different GPS collar weights for a week at a time: light, 30g (<1% BM); medium, 80g (similar to 2% BM); and heavy, 130g (similar to 3% BM). Location error (LE) and fix success rates (FSR) were compared between backyard habitats and up- or downward orientation of the GPS tags on collars.
   Key results Home-range size and distance travelled from home were smaller when cats wore the heaviest collar. LE was lower and FSR higher for GPS tags with direct-line-of-sight to satellites (e.g. on lawns), but there was no difference between tags placed in dense vegetation (hedges) or more open vegetation (trees), or tags oriented up or down.
   Conclusions Collars carrying instruments on cats should be no more than 2% BM (medium-weight collar). LE was large relative to typical urban habitat size, indicating that misclassification of locations into habitats could easily occur in habitat-selection studies.
   Implications Some published accounts of cat home-range sizes may be underestimates, resulting in underestimates of the extent of impacts on prey species. Habitat-use studies should acknowledge the error associated with GPS tags and incorporate it into analyses using techniques such as Brownian Bridges.

AB  - Rural Alberta is decreasing in population with a resulting reduction in services to the people who continue to live outside the metropolitan areas of Calgary and Edmonton. As services within rural communities decline, a commensurate increase in stress occurs for the population that remains.
   By delivering a program that matches post-secondary students with nonprofit/voluntary sector (NPVS) organizations that are in need of skilled workers, Volunteer Alberta, through its sponsorship of the Serving Communities Internship Program (SCiP), struck upon a plan to provide for rural re-development. Volunteer Alberta worked through Alberta's 21 post-secondary institutions to promote internships that were available throughout the province. During the 2011/12 school year volunteer placements occurred. Throughout the fall of 2012 we conducted an evaluation of the program through a study that utilized comprehensive online surveys, as well as interviews with a purposeful sample of interns and NPVS organizations.
   Survey and interview data revealed that both the interns and the NPVS organizations were highly satisfied with the SCiP format, the services provided to them by Volunteer Alberta, and the quality of the internships, and the interns they acquired. SCiP intern motivation came from the opportunity to use skills and knowledge developed in post-secondary programs in such a way that they could later use the experience as evidence of their ability to future employers.
   Interview data from both the interns and the NPVS organizations in rural areas of the province revealed that volunteer post-secondary student exposure to rural community organizations led to a positive change in perception about the work of the NPVS in general and rural communities in particular. Evidence of change of perception was strong enough to indicate that a longitudinal study should be conducted to see if the positive perception of rural communities attained through working there will be acted upon, and lead to an increased movement toward paid work in the non-profit/voluntary sector in both urban and rural areas of the province.

AB  - Availability is traditionally assessed based on the assumption that the sole type of random event affecting service is equipment failure. However, when considering data communication networks, other events, such as packet loss rate, latency and jitter also affect the quality of service and need to be taken into account [1]. Quality of service, beyond availability, refers to average delays in receiving messages, or the probability of losing messages.
   Communication-based Train Control (CBTC) is one of the contemporary solutions for advanced urban mass transit rail systems [2], including some driverless ones. It relies on a train-borne data communication network, a trackside data communication network and radio-based track-to-train communication. Access points (APs) are regularly spaced along the track and allow the train to communicate to the trackside communication network.
   The data pertaining to automatic train protection and operation are carried by those networks. Those data are safety-critical, as they include the "movement authority", i.e. how far a train is allowed to proceed under current conditions (trains ahead of it, state of signals, etc.). Other data, such as passenger information, public address, passenger entertainment, usually are carried by a separate, non-safety-related network.
   However, for cost reduction reasons, there is a trend to merge those two train-borne networks (the safety-related signaling one and the passenger information one) into a single network.
   Then, the issue arises of guaranteeing nonetheless a sufficient quality of service, i.e. avoiding saturation of the network due to bursts or other phenomena, with resulting loss of messages (packets) or excessive delays.
   One problem is that the range of frequencies that can be used by the APs is limited. As a result, interferences may happen between trains; these could lead to spurious emergency brakes (i.e. unintended, unwanted occurrence of such braking) and would therefore adversely impact availability.
   This paper focuses on quantifying probabilistically how often such potential interference situations, called "internal interferences", are likely to occur. First, an analysis of the causes of those interferences is performed. Several types of scenarios are investigated.
   Then a probabilistic model of the various scenarios leading to potential interferences is elaborated.
   The traffic of trains moving toward a cell is modeled as the arrival process in a queue [5], and the time to cross a cell is modeled as the service process of the queue. Queues with finite buffers, i.e. a maximum allowed number of waiting customers, are considered, to account for the fact that, due to signaling techniques, there is no more than one train in a cell at any given time.
   Then, the average number of potential simple interferences (between two trains) and multiple interferences (between more than two trains) are derived. They are expressed as functions of the headway (time between two successive trains) and the average speed.
   The dimensioning factor is the ratio of the time to cross a communication cell (itself a function of the spacing between the APs) to the headway.
   In this way it can be determined how the communication architecture must be adapted to cope with a growing traffic while retaining a desired quality-of-service target.
   The adequacy of a frequency plan (i.e. the allocation of frequencies to the various cells) can also be assessed.
   This type of model can increase the trust that designers and operators may place in a system that depends heavily on data communication networks performance.

AB  - Funded by the EEC Sixth Framework Program, the SEAHELLARC project was aimed to evaluate, and better understand the causes, of the various natural geohazards (chiefly earthquakes and tsunamis), which frequently affect the western Peloponnese area and particularly its coastal domain; this region is one of the most seismically active of Greece and therefore of the Mediterranean Sea. Based on a set of new geophysical data, such as detailed swath bathymetry and high-resolution sub-bottom Chirp, we have distinguished and studied four contrasted domains along, this area of the Peloponnese active continental margin underlined by intense crustal seismicity and marked by very contrasted and often sharp continental slopes; from east to vest these are: (1) an area including the continental shelf and the upper slope; there sedimentary overload and destabilizations, syn-sedimentary faults, mass transport deposits and active sedimentary by-pass mechanisms are the main risk factors. (2) The middle to lower continental slopes, is mainly expressed by two, N-S trending, fault-related, depressions, where active deformations, well recorded by actual tilting of the sedimentary blanket, occur. (3) West of this deep structural depressions exists a poorly sedimented ridge area (from which merges the small Strophades Islands) also showing N-S and E-W trending lineaments resulting in a dense network of fractures and scarps and leading too a particularly complex sub-marine morphology; this area, together with the westernmost deep domain (4), which bounds the continental margin, clearly records the effects of significant active tectonic. Our studies of the shallow and recent sedimentary cover of the continental margin off western Peloponnese, confirm that this active margin segment is an area where geohazards can be expected. In addition to fault ruptures, generated at depth by the specific tectonic framework, sedimentary collapses, particularly along the shelf break nearby Cape Katakolo, may trigger significant local tsunamis, which may in turn induce strong damages all along the nearby coasts up to the town of Pylos.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to estimate the dose in human tissues after inhalation exposure to airborne particulate matter-bound metals at a landfill site. Field measurements have revealed that the 8-h permissible exposure limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for particulate matter (PM10) was not exceeded for the working personnel at an outdoor weighing facility in the Akrotiri landfill (Chania, Greece). However, PM10 concentrations were exceeding the EU health protection standards (50 mu g/m(3)). Furthermore, dust emanating from landfill operations contains traces of heavy metals due to the nature of materials (e. g., sludge, batteries) which have been deposited over the lifetime of the landfill. In addition, particulatematter-bound metals concentrations at the landfill are enhanced by refuse truck emissions (e. g., exhaust, tire wear dust, brake wear dust, road surface wear dust and resuspension of deposited PM on a road surface) and resuspension from the surface of the composting site. Estimations of particle-bound metals dose in the human body were performed for arsenite (AS(III)), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). The Exposure Dose Model (ExDoM) in conjunction with a Physiologically Based PharmacoKinetic (PBPK) model was applied to determine the dose for an adult Caucasian male worker. The ExDoM was used to estimate the human exposure and the deposition, dose, clearance, retention of particulate matter-bound metals in the human respiratory tract and the mass transferred to the gastrointestinal tract and blood. The PBPK model was developed to describe the movement of metals from the blood into the tissues as a blood-flow-limited model. The results showed that after 1 day of exposure to PMAsIII, the major accumulation occurs in the lung, muscle and liver. In addition, for PMPb, the major accumulation occurs in the bone, blood and muscle whereas as regard PMCd the major accumulation occurs in the other tissues (the rest of the body), kidney and liver. The results indicate an increased health risk for an adult Caucasian male worker at the landfill site due to exposure to elevated particulate matter concentrations and their associated metallic content.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of the scientific and local researches in the working of the national and state historical and cultural reserves of Cherkasy region. The methodology of the research and the main regional editions are analyzed.
   Among the science that studies the relationship and interaction of the events that occurred in different periods in the area, particularly the local lore, which is a collection of scientific disciplines with different content and separate methods. It forms a powerful scientific movement to promote the knowledge about one or the other edge or region. Our region is connected with a lot of memorable events in national history, the life and activity of outstanding personalities of Ukraine, including Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Taras Shevchenko. The four national, three state historical and cultural reserves, there are the twenty three museums of the state and communal ownership, all of them keep and enhance the cultural heritage of the region.
   The scientific and local researches in national and state historical and cultural reserves are highly relevant, because occupy a leading place in the national-cultural revival of the sovereign Ukraine and are pillars of the state.
   There are no studies which analyze the activity of the reserves in the modern scientific historiography.
   The aims of this article are to analyze the scientific-regional activities of the national and state historical and cultural reserves of Cherkasy region, to research methodology and to discuss the main regional editions.
   Museum staff conducted a comprehensive study of the history of towns and villages of Cherkasy region, published the regional history literature. The marketing and analytical research of the tourist and excursion routes and the demand for visits to historical and cultural monuments are Conducted. On the basis of reserves and museums the memory lessons, lectures to students on local history topics, including the study of the customs and rites of the Ukrainian people are organized.
   From the beginning of its origins the research work of historians was aimed at studying the secret pages of the history of towns and villages, the life and work of famous fellow of the history of the individual aspects of social and economic life, the protection and preservation of historical and cultural monuments of the region. The results of years of researches is the implementation of various forms of local history, the local history readings, meetings, the preparation of presentations and exhibitions and the radio broadcasts.
   A peculiar result of local history research is not only the Region but the whole of Ukraine, was the first Ukrainian Congress of museums, dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the birth of T. G. Shevchenko, which was held from 13 to 17 September 2010 in Cherkassy. The Congress was organized by the Department of culture and tourism of Cherkasy regional state administration and regional the Museum of local history. The founders developed new regional editions, including The Development of museums in Cherkasy" and "Cherkasy cultural and tourist". The nineteen regions of Ukraine and Kyiv delegated 154 participants (51-of the regions of Ukraine, 103 representatives of the Museum and the local history of Cherkasy region) to take part in the work of the Congress.
   Summarizing, you can make such conclusions that the studying of local history of each region is the basic of the General history of Ukraine. In Cherkasy we didn't only save the local tradition, but we updated the methodology of their research and formed an innovative approach to highlight the results of this work through the publication of popular scientific and journalistic literature, organizing and conducting exhibitions, seminars, meetings and other cultural events. So it is necessary in the in the cities and districts of the region to continue the studying of the local history, its prominent figures, to preserve and enhance the spiritual heritage of our region.

AB  - Trackways of archosaurs have recently been discovered in sandstones of the Upper Triassic (Norian-Rhaetian) Baoding Formation of Panzhihua City in southern Sichuan Province, China. Based on their overall-morphology, pes imprints are of characteristic chirotheriid shape showing a compact and symmetrical anterior group of digit traces II-IV with the trace of digit III being the longest, and a posterolaterally positioned, long and slender trace of digit V. Imprints of digit I and the manus are not preserved. This could be related to substrate conditions and the relatively shallow impressions, even if peculiarities in the gait such as overstep of the manus by the pes or bipedal movement cannot completely be excluded. Ichnotaxonomically, the imprints are assigned tentatively to cf. Chi rotherium. There are some similarities with the type ichnospecies C. barthii from the Middle Triassic that has a global distribution and that was described also from the Guanling Formation (Middle Triassic) of adjacent Guizhou Province. However, the long and slender digit V that lacks a distinct large oval basal pad, the relatively short stride/step length, the low pace angulation, and the slight inward rotation of the imprints toward the midline are different. The peculiar shape of digit V and the lack of digit I in all imprints also preclude an assignment to the common Late Triassic ichnogenus Brachychirotherium or similar ichnotaxa such as Pseudotetrasauro pus. An isolated tridactyl footprint on the same surface is different in shape from the chirotheriid ones by the stronger mesaxony and narrower digit divarication. It is considered here as a possible large grallatorid. This is the first occurrence of tetrapod footprints in the Baoding Formation of Sichuan Province and the second record of chirotheriids in the Triassic of China. The Baoding Formation has also yielded a characteristic Upper Triassic flora with cycads, filicopsids, gingkos, and conifers as well as bivalve fossils. The depositional environment can be designated as fluvial-lacustrine with occasional opening to marine areas. Considering biostratigraphic and palaeobiogeographic aspects, the late occurrence of chirotheriids cf. Chirotherium in China supports the view that basal crown-group archosaurs with a distinct tendency toward a functionally tridactyl pes developed and dispersed in parallel to typical tridactyl dinosaurs.

AB  - Topographic field data and environmental forcing agents were used to assess morphological changes (19952010) at Ginst Spit, Pendine Sands, West Wales and flood potential at Laugharne, a town in the lee of the spit. Areal change between annual surveys showed variable distal end migration eastward extending into the channel of the Towy, Taf and Gwendreath estuaries. Dominant waves emanate from south toward southwest and suggest that the longshore sediment drift is from west toward east. However, sub-dominant waves from southeast are limited by fetch but engender a counter drift back toward the west at the distal end forming the customary northward hook. Wave model results showed significant modifications occurred between the inshore model boundary and the nearshore zone and overall results suggest that spit evolution is dependent on sediment movement that occurs during high spring tidal conditions within this macrotidal environment. Precipitation and flood events were correlated to spit evolution, which suggested that a combination of fluvial and coastal processes in combination contribute to the flooding of Laugharne town.

AB  - In the last fifty years of Mamluk rule, sultans actively engaged in commerce, warfare, and diplomacy in their northern regions of Syria and Anatolia with the Ottomans, Aqquyunlu, and Dulgadir and Qaraman beyliks. However, scholarship in general neglects the thirtyyear period between Barsbay and Qa'itbay (1438-1468) or charts it as a period of decline. Further, aside from textual accounts, there is little material evidence pointing to the nature of interaction: commercial, military, or otherwise. This paper will present two unpublished inscriptions and argue that there is some evidence for Mamluk development and patronage on the frontier. The inscriptions, found in a village or small town in the Amuq Plain near Antakya in the Hatay Province of Turkey, bear the name of two fifteenth-century Mamluk sultans. The inscriptions' words, location, and context introduce wider evidence of Mamluk sultans as patrons in developing commercial routes and khans and encouraging movement in general across northern Syria. This patronage occurred at a time when the dynamics of political power were fluctuating in surrounding southern Anatolia as they were in Egypt.

AB  - On 15 February 2010, as a result of intense and long-lasting rainfalls, a large landslide affected a wide area near the town of Maierato (Calabria, Italy). The studies conducted - including (i) aerial photo interpretation, (ii) geological and geomorphological field investigations, (iii) interpretations of lithology and stratigraphy from borehole data, and (iv) observation of videos filmed during the main diastrophic phases of the landslide and of antecedent Google Street View images - allowed researchers to reconstruct the geological and tectonic setting of the slope and the internal structure of the landslide with the estimation of the depth of the sliding surface, the triggering mechanisms and its evolution.
   The analysis of the prelandslide event setting demonstrates that this mass movement is the reactivation of a preexisting landslide of alleged seismic origin, remaining at an incipient stage.
   The Maierato landslide occurred on a gentle slope made of late Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene clastic and evaporitic sedimentary rocks. The main basal failure surface that developed on the hemipelagic mans has a maximum depth of 50 m. The volume of the landslide is similar to 5 million cubic meters.
   The type of landslide movement is a complex one, consisting of a very rapid slide of rock and earth and of flow of debris and earth. The landslide clearly shows three major types of failure mechanisms: the first type is described as a rapidly moving rotational slide where back-tilted blocks of sediment are preserved; the second type includes a very rapidly moving translational slide of large rock blocks; the third type includes sudden, extremely rapid flow-slides where the slide material is disaggregated while flowing downward along a gentle slope.
   The slide is a compound one, with a retrogressive evolution and transformation into earth and debris flow during the failure. After the triggering of the landslide, and as a result of the relevant displacement, an important portion of the lower evaporitic unit (Calcare di Base Formation), close to the failure surface, collapsed, thereby undergoing a quick change of its mechanical behavior that became similar to that of a viscous fluid. During the landslide evolution, large rocky blocks consisting of Miocene evaporitic limestones, Pliocene silty clays, and sands were rafted, without severe disturbance, on the destructurated and fluidized limestone. The intense destructuration and the presence of water transformed the limestone (in the lower parts of the unit) into a viscous material that was squeezed out of the landslide mass through the jags between the several rafted rocky blocks and along the natural levees of flow tongue.
   This event is a rather frequent combination of mass movements made complicated and spectacular by the fluidization of the weak limestone that imparted great dynamics to the movements. Such fluidization is an infrequent phenomenon especially in this geological context (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Pleistocene geology of Armenia is dominated by widespread occurrence of sediments recording recurring rapid and drastic changes of the environmental conditions during at least the last 2 million years. These sediments, predominantly diatomites, contain a huge variety of various fossil remains, allowing the reconstruction of flora, fauna as well as the climatic conditions especially during dispersal of early man into Eurasia 1.8 Ma. Radio isotope dating of pumice levels as well as a detailed magnetostratigraphic study have been carried out in Syunik Province near the town of Sisian, southern Armenia, in order to establish a temporal correlation of all major outcrops of paleo-lake sediments and to provide a timeframe for paleoenvironmental studies within this lake sediment succession. A total of 455 oriented drill cores was sampled at six large and four short sections with a sampling resolution between 5 and 20 cm. Detailed paleomagnetic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) pointing either to the north and down or south and up. A positive reversal test suggests the primary character of this magnetization component. Combining the normal and reverse polarity directions results in an overall sample mean direction of D = 354.8 degrees, I = 51.5 degrees with a Fisherian precision parameter k of 14.6 and the associated alpha(95) of 2.9 degrees, combining demagnetization data of 169 samples. In addition, ash layers were sampled for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology at five of the sections studied paleomagnetically and three additional small outcrops. The resulting ages range between 1.31 Ma and 1.08 Ma, with two samples yielding similar to 1.65 and 1.90 Ma. The latter are characterized by extremely low abundances of radiogenic 40Ar, suggesting that the mineral system has not been closed since the time of eruption, leading to substantial loss in Ar. Integration of these radio-isotope dates with the polarity data suggests that the normal polarities can be linked to the Jaramillo subchron within the Matuyama reversed polarity chron. Based on the longest interval of normal polarity identified at Ashotavan-2, a lower limit for the sedimentation rate of similar to 37 cm/ky can be estimated. Therefore, we infer the duration of lake sedimentation as similar to 350 ky, starting at similar to 1.4 Ma. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peste-des-petits- ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and devastating disease of goats and sheep. Although India is endemic for PPR, Tripura, a state in North East India has never been reported confirmed PPR outbreaks. Recently, an outbreak of PPR occurred in nondescript goats at the Sabroom town of Tripura state in North-East India in June, 2013. The causative agent, PPR virus (PPRV) was confirmed by sandwich ELISA, virus isolation and N gene based RT-PCR and sequencing. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the involvement of lineage IV PPR virus in the outbreak. The outbreak viruses from Tripura state were clustered mainly with circulating viruses from Bangladesh, India, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Dubai and Kurdistan. However, the nucleotide sequence homology ranged from 99.2 to 99.6% with the PPR strains circulating in Bangladesh during 2011 and 2012 whereas 95.5-98% homology has been observed with the viruses from India and other countries. These findings suggest the transboundary circulation of PPR virus between India and Bangladesh border, which warrant immediate vaccination across the international border to create an immune belt.

AB  - The comedy Gore ot Uma was planned and written after the War of 1812, the time of formation and rise of the Decembrist movement and active collision of the new and the past. The contraposition of the new to the past was the basis of the comedy and it is not only a matter of the conflict but a way to contrast and identify the views of the characters. Two ages, the new age, dreaming of the future, and the past age, constantly referring to the old times, define the antithesis of one's own and stranger's spaces, internal and external, of order and incident, reality and dream, living and dead, of light and darkness, intelligence and stupidity, etc. Space-time coordinates of Gore ot Uma define the meaning of such lexical items as dom (home), semya (family), rod (kin), svoy (own), chuzhoy (alien), gost' (guest), vek (century), kalendar' (calendar), vremya (time) etc. It also reveals the antithesis of natural time and artificial one. The very remaining confrontation of the old and new capitals - Moscow and St. Petersburg - has derived from the comedy as well. Famusov's house mythologem is not only a locus in quo but also the leading character in some way. It is not only a particular building or home, but also a symbol of sedentary life, chores, family ties, etc., but also an image of a bigger house - Moscow, an extended family circle, a circle of people, of men of the cast. Gore ot Uma presents an image of the time, consisting not only of historical and social characteristics, but also of its subjective figurative perception by the characters: slow-motion time characterizes the world of Famusov and rapid one determines Chatsky's. It is notable, that the natural stream of life is replaced in the house of Famusov with a cycle, which is determined by a clock (which he significantly sets in Act 1) and a calendar (which defines continuous domestic events like births or deaths of known people). The image of Moscow in the comedy is both definite and indefinite as it is a model of a house, a city, and a world. The very concept of dom is nuclear to Russian linguistic consciousness, it defines inner space occupied by a human surrounded by chaos. It is the first human's universe which gathers all human's memory, dreams and thus links the times. Thus, different spaces and times distinguish differences in characters' outlooks, minds and represent the comedy's dramatic conflict. If translators of the comedy fail to render this complex space-time antithesis, it leads to substantial losses of meaning. Comparison with German translation Kummer durch Verstand by Louis Schneider, 1831 clearly identifies conceptual and artistic richness of the original as well as Russian linguistic world-image.

AB  - Background. Afrikaners are a unique ethnic group in South Africa (SA) with well-documented ancestral records spanning a period of over 350 years. They are mainly descended from Dutch, German and French settlers to SA in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today several disorders in this population occur at relatively high frequencies as a result of founder effects.
   Objective. To determine whether a founder effect for Parkinson's disease (PD) is present in the Afrikaner population.
   Methods. Study participants were recruited from the Movement Disorders Clinic at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, SA, and from support groups of the Parkinson's Association of South Africa. Standard methods for genealogical research in SA on hereditary diseases were used including interviews and searches in sources such as state archives, the Huguenot Museum in Franschhoek, marriage and baptismal records, and tombstone inscriptions.
   Results. For 40 of the PD families, there was only a single most recent ancestral couple common to all of the families. On average there are between three and four ancestral lines to the founder couple per proband (range 1 -14).
   Conclusion. If genetic studies confirm the presence of a founder effect for PD in Afrikaners, this would imply that there is a large number of individuals from this ethnic group who may potentially be at risk of developing this debilitating condition. This study illustrates and reinforces the concept that genealogical analysis is a powerful tool for identification of founder effects for various disorders in the Afrikaner population.

AB  - The republic of Georgia is a mountainous and tectonically active area that is vulnerable to landslides. Because landslides are one of the most devastating natural hazards, their detection and monitoring is of great importance. In this study we report on a previously unknown landslide in central Georgia near the town of Sachkhere. We used a set of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data to generate displacement maps using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We detected a sliding zone of dimensions 2 km north-south by 0.6 km east-west that threatens four villages. We estimated surface displacement of up to similar to 30 cm/yr over the sliding body in the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction, with the largest displacement occurring after a local tectonic earthquake. We mapped the morphology of the landslide mass by aerial photography and field surveying. We found a complex set of interacting processes, including surface fracturing, shear and normal faults at both the headwall and the sides of the landslide, local landslide velocity changes, earthquake-induced velocity peaks, and loss in toe support due to mining activity. Important implications that are applicable elsewhere can be drawn from this study of coupled processes.
   We used inverse dislocation modelling to find a possible dislocation plane resembling the landslide basal decollement, and we used that plane to calculate the volume of the landslide. The results suggest a decollement at similar to 120 m depth, dipping at similar to 10 degrees sub-parallel to the surface, which is indicative of a translational-type landslide.

AB  - This article deals with describing of sheet erosion at the experimental area of The Pozarsky stream catchment. The experimental area is located near the town Krivoklat, in the Central Bohemian Region, where highlands dominate. This area is characterized by the occurrence of very deep valley, shaped like the letter "U" to "V", which contain torrents and often deep gullies.
   In this experimental area, there are built five torrent control cross-section objects. Especially two of them are located in the gullies, which are surrounded by managed fields. There is an assumption of the sheet erosion occurence. In this topic, there are two, points of view" presented - solving of water erosion at fields which is presented mainly like soil loss and on the other hand there is solving of sediment transport at steep land area at a torrent (gully) catchment.
   To understand the principles of release, transport and storage of sediment in the channel of torrent (in the bed of gully) it is needed to calculate sediment transport regime. For the calculation it is necessary to carry out detailed field surveys and surveys about erosion in the area. The calculation give an overview of the formation of sediment in the catchment, especially with their assumed amount and volume.
   This knowledge contains basic data for the design of appropriate torrent control objects, such as constructions of some cross-section objects, and then determines the type and parameters of necessary precautions and in this case it gives the possibility to verify torrent (gully) control objects functions.
   Attention is focused on defining the source areas of released sediment particles in the catchment and their movement in the bed of the stream (gully) from their place of release to their place of storage (in the streambed area or retention capacity of the experimental objects).

AB  - Wadowice, the home town of John Paul II, like nearly every town in Poland, had its Jewish population. They were the only ethnic majority of any size in the Polish-dominated town, accounting for approximately one-fourth of its population (2000 persons). From the middle of the 19th century they were a permanent element of the town's cultural image. During World War II they met the same fate as almost all the Polish Jews: they became the target of the Germans' criminal Holocaust programme. Barely 150 of them survived.
   The Archives of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw contain 13 accounts of Jews from Wadowice who survived the Holocaust, prepared right after the war, and in just one instance in the 1960s. They are an interesting and special supplement to the stories of the fate of that community known from literature and reminiscences contained in the Remembrance book" of Wadowice Jews published in Israel in the 1960s. Starting with reprisals in the early months of the Nazi occupation in 1939 (including the burning down of the synagogue and confiscation of the Jews' businesses), through restrictions on movement in certain areas of the town in 1940, the first mass deportations to the Bake death camp in July 1942, to the establishment of the Wadowice Ghetto immediately afterwards, to its liquidation on a symbolic date commemorating the destruction of the shrine in Jerusalem, i.e., on 10 August 1943.
   The survivors' reminiscences contain many names of the Wadowice Jews. In the footnotes the Author attempted to shed more light on these persons and the history of their families as this was an additional opportunity to show how vast was the institutional network of the small community of Wadowice Jews and how well organized it was before the war.
   The survivors' stories can be quite long. They concern their dramatic fate throughout World War II. Therefore the author decided to summarise in parentheses the "nonWadowice" threads from these stories, with only the experience from Wadowice itself published at length.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In many low-and middle-income countries, formal trauma surveillance strategies have not yet been widely implemented.
   OBJECTIVE To formalize injury data collection at Groote Schuur Hospital, the chief academic hospital of the University of Cape Town, a level I trauma center, and one of the largest trauma referral hospitals in the world.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective study of all trauma admissions from October 1, 2010, through September 30, 2011, at Groote Schuur Hospital. A standard admission form was developed with multidisciplinary input and was used for both clinical and data abstraction purposes. Analysis of data was performed in 3 parts: demographics of injury, injury risk by location, and access to and maturity of trauma services. Geographic information science was then used to create satellite imaging of injury "hot spots" and to track referral patterns. Finally, the World Health Organization trauma system maturity index was used to evaluate the current breadth of the trauma system in place.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The demographics of trauma patients, the distribution of injury in a large metropolitan catchment, and the patterns of injury referral and patient movement within the trauma system.
   RESULTS The minimum 34-point data set captured relevant demographic, geographic, incident, and clinical data for 9236 patients. Data field completion rates were highly variable. An analysis of demographics of injury (age, sex, and mechanism of injury) was performed. Most violence occurred toward males (71.3%) who were younger than 40 years of age (74.6%). We demonstrated high rates of violent interpersonal injury (71.6% of intentional injury) and motor vehicle injury (18.8% of all injuries). There was a strong association between injury and alcohol use, with alcohol implicated in at least 30.1% of trauma admissions. From a systems standpoint, the data suggest a mature pattern of referral consistent with the presence of an inclusive trauma system.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implementation of injury surveillance at Groote Schuur Hospital improved insights about injury risk based on demographics and neighborhood as well as access to service based on patterns of referral. This information will guide further development of South Africa's already advanced trauma system.

AB  - The landslides induced by the Mid-Niigata Offshore earthquake in 2007 (M(JMA)6.8) occurred mostly along the shore of the Japan Sea. This study focused on the landslides that occurred near the Hijirigahana Cape, Yoneyama Town in the Niigata Prefecture.
   The study area is located in the western region of the central Niigata Prefecture, along the Japan Sea. The geology of the landslide area is dominated by late Miocene sandstone-rich member of alternating beds of sandstone and siltstone. These strata gently dip to the north at approximately 25 degrees to 30 degrees and form cataclinal and orthoclinal slopes on the north- and west-facing slopes, respectively. The central Niigata region is one of the most landslide-prone areas in Japan. The study area is located approximately 30 km from the epicenter of the earthquake with an estimated intensity of 6 lower in the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) scale.
   A group of landslides occurred in the study area. The area contains the most concentrated set of landslides from this earthquake, even though it is located far from the epicenter. Most of the landslides occurred on north-facing slopes, but two occurred on west-facing slopes. The landslides on the north-facing slopes are characterized as translational slides. The largest rock slide in the study area, Unit D (width 100 m, length 230 m), slipped along the bedding plane of the strata. Observations from slickenlines from the slip surface and outcrop in the upper portion of Unit D suggest that before this earthquake, landslides frequently occurred on the north-facing slopes and were controlled by the bedding plane. With the exception of the largest one, other landslides on north-facing slopes were mostly debris slides, indicating that sediments from older landslides exist.
   The second largest landslide occurred on a west-facing orthodinal slope. A rotational rock slide, Unit A, was 80 m wide and 100 m long. During the excavation after the landslide, a high angle fault with a SW dip was identified behind the crushed zone. Based on field observation, the fault was considered to be a non-tectonic fault and created by gravitational movement. During the excavation, the crushed zone was identified on the cutting wall of the slope. These results revealed that the relatively larger rotational rock slides occurred because of the existence of the crushed zone due to older events that caused the slippage along a non-tectonic fault.

AB  - As the western boundary fault of the Songliao Basin and the eastern margin of the Da Xing' an Mountains, Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt is located in the central part of northeastern China, the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt It extends along the boundary between the Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the NNE striking, and then goes into the Hebei Province to the south, connecting with the Pingchang-Sangyuan Fault, with a total length over 1200km. The Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt is considered traditionally to be a huge deep-seated fault, and characterized by a normal fault or detachment fault. So far, some regional geophysical research on this fault zone is focused on its northern segment, the Nenjiang Fault, including the bouguer gravity anomaly, the aeromagnetic anomaly, and the deep reflection seismic profile, which revealed the regional distribution of the Nenjiang Fault System and indicated that Nenjiang Fault System should be a huge low-angle normal fault or detachment fault. In the southern segment of this fault belt, it is called the Hongshan-Balihan Fault, which has been studied as the eastern margin detachment fault of the Kalaqin (Harkin) Uplift. The study on the middle part of the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt is rare. We newly found a S-L typed ductile shear zone at the Lingxia, Baicheng City, the middle-southern part of the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault belt, and compared this ductile shear zone with that at the Louzidian area, in the southern part of the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault belt. Based on the field investigation, measurements of structures in the field, micro-structural studies, finite strain measurements, a study on preferred crystal orientations of quartz determined by Electron Back Scatter Diffraction and muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 chronology of the deformed rocks in the ductile shear zone, we suggested that the deformation features of the Lingxia and Louzidian ductile shear zones are similar, and that they represent one continuous fault, i.e., the middle-southern segment of the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt, which experienced a sinistral strike-slip ductile shearing in the Early Cretaceous (similar to 130Ma). In this study, we found a ductile shear zone at the Nierji area, in the northern-middle section of the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt. By the measurement of structural elements, the micro-structure studies and the finite strain measurement, the Nierji ductile shear zone shows similar NE striking and sinistral strike-slipping shearing to that from the Lingxia and Louzidian ductile shear zones, but presents L-typed extensional shearing which is different from the S-L typed shearing in the Lingxia and Louzidian areas. The zircon U-Pb dating on the granitic L type tectonite at the Nierji area shows that; 1) all zircons have a high value of Th/U (0. 06 similar to 1. 25) and exhibit euhedral crystal shapes and an oscillatory zoning in CL images, indicating their magmatic origin; 2) these zircon ages are divided into two ranges, 258 similar to 403 Ma (n = 5) and 207 similar to 174Ma (n = 15, with a mean value of 190. 0 +/- 6.
   1Ma); 3) the old age group of 258 similar to 403Ma generally displays a core-rim texture in CL images, indicating multiple Paleozoic magmatic events having been in this area, and the two core ages of similar to 190Ma was found in the young age group of 207 similar to 174Ma, suggesting that this area underwent a stronger Early Jurassic magmatic intrusion event and the protolith of Nierji shearing zone formed in the early Middle Jurassic (similar to 170Ma), not the previous Permian. The laser Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite dating shows a relatively well plateau age of 158. 99 +/- 0. 61 Ma. The micro-structural observation, the rotated K-feldspar porphyroclasts and S-C fabrics demonstrate the sinistral shear sense of the ductile shear zones, and the recrystallization types of feldspar show bugling recrystallization (BLG) and the recrystallization types of quartz display a transition stage of subgrain rotation to grain boundary migration recrystallization (SR-GBM). Therefore, we suggest that the metamorphic grade of the shear zone in the Nierji shearing zone should have reached high greenschist facies conditions and deformation temperatures of around 500 degrees C, which is obviously higher than the blocking temperature of muscovite (300 similar to 400 degrees C). Hence, the Ar-40/Ar-39 age of muscovite from the Nierji shearing zone should be a cooling age. We think that the sinistral strike-slipping event at the Nierji area occurred in the Middle to Late Jurassic and the Nierji shear zone underwent fast uplifting at 158. 99 +/- 0. 61 Ma. Combined with the newly published chronological data from the Heilongjiang blueschists (have been called as Helongjiang Group) in NE China and the famous Tancheng-Lujiang Fault Belt and its northern extension in the East China, and the study on the speed and direction of movement of the West Pacific Plate, we suggest that; 1) the Nenjiang-Balihan Fault Belt maybe undergo three main deformation stages, including the Middle to Late Jurassic sinistral extensional strike-slip shearing stage (similar to 160Ma), the middle Early Cretaceous sinistral strike-slip or oblique slip shearing stage (similar to 130Ma) and the late Early Cretaceous extensional stage; 2) these two strike-slip shearing stages are similar to those from the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault Belt and its northern extension (Dunhua-Mishan and Jiamusi-Yitong Fault Belts), and the formation time of the early shearing (similar to 160Ma) is later 10Myr than the time of subduction (similar to 170Ma) between the Jiamusi and Songliao Blocks; 3) the early formation stage of the Songliao Basin was controlled by the Middle to Late Jurassic sinistral strike-slip fault, which are related to the speed and direction of oblique subduction of the West Pacific plate under Eurasian continent and responsive collision during the Jurassic times.
