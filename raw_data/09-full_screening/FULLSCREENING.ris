AB  - Functional connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of populations. However, many studies assess connectivity with a focus on structural connectivity only. Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, trafﬁc or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene ﬂow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/ gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene ﬂow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene ﬂow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence–absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Context
              Urbanisation is an environmental filter for many species that leads to community homogenisation, with a few species inhabiting isolated patches (e.g. public and private gardens and parks) embedded within the urban landscape. Promoting biodiversity in urban areas requires understanding which species traits allow species to survive the urban landscape.
            
            
              Objectives
              The objective of this study was to assess how species traits and landscape factors combine to allow species functional groups to live in the city.
            
            
              Methods
              We used butterfly count data collected by volunteers in 24 gardens of Barcelona city, during 2018 and 2019. Species were clustered in functional groups according to their traits. We applied a multinomial choice model to test for the effect of the landscape on the different functional groups.
            
            
              Results
              Three functional groups became prevalent in the city while a fourth, containing most sedentary specialist species, was filtered out. Although the observed groups had similar species richness, abundances varied depending on urban landscape characteristics. Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study highlights the need of contextualised management with actions accounting for the species functional groups, rather than a management focused on general species richness. It demonstrates that urban landscape planning must focus on improving connectivity inside the city in order to diversify the community composition.

AB  - Construction and protection of ecological networks (ENs) is considered to be an effective means to curb habitat fragmentation and strengthen landscape connectivity. In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on “quality–function–structure” was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the “quality–function–structure” of WUA in 2020. It is suggested that all ecological sources must be included in nature reserves to prevent natural or manmade erosion. The key areas to be repaired were determined through the quality evaluation of ecological corridors. The priority of construction and protection of ecological corridors was determined by coupling two topological structures and functions. We argue that specific protection strategies and directions can be determined according to the construction objectives of local ENs.

AB  - The remaining historical forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in urban areas. However, the integrity and stability of historical forests are affected by land-use/cover change. A better understanding of these impacts can help prioritize protection and restoration. In this study, we estimated the loss of area and levels of threats and analyzed the importance of critical areas for historical forests in the built-up area of a rapidly urbanizing city—Guiyang, China. We used the threat indicator, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and probability of connectivity based on InVEST, GuidosToolbox, and Conefor software. The results based on remote sensing image classification showed that 1988.46 ha of historical forestlands was transformed into other land-use/cover types. The mean value of the threat index of all the historical forest patches increased by 33% compared to the baseline year. The area of cores and bridges, considered as key nodes and links for the connectivity of forest networks, decreased by 193.32 and 353.61 ha, respectively. Most of the critical areas with high importance values for connectivity were located in the central part of the city and were severely threatened by the surrounding areas. We recommend that effective measures be implemented to control the further loss of historical forests and to increase the connectivity and buffering capacity of the remaining forests by creating tree belts and corridors in key locations.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5–20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure – through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity – but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Stellaria holostea
              is a clonal herb highly confined to well-established deciduous forests. This study examined whether its genetic diversity and spatial genetic organization in urban forest islands is similar to the values from well-established populations outside urban landscape. We studied four populations in Warsaw and two populations from well preserved forests outside the city. Genetic diversity was greater in populations from well-preserved forests than from forests heavily exploited in the past. High clonal diversity indices indicate that the studied populations did not lose the ability to reproduce sexually. The small populations in urban forests differed from the remaining sites in spatial organization. High overall F
              ST
              (0.24) and the lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distance between the studied populations indicate limited gene flow. Urban forests may be of great value for conservation of
              S. holostea
              and other ancient forest species as they may still harbor substantial genetic variability despite their isolation.

TI  - Urban landscape matrix affects avian diversity in remnant vegetation fragments: Evidence from the Phoenix metropolitan region, USA
AU  - Litteral, Jennifer

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Biodiversity conservation in urban areas has become increasingly important as cities have expanded to cover larger proportions of landscapes across the world. The careful planning of habitat reserves within urbanized areas has the potential to make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We surveyed the passerine community in 15 habitat reserves within the Phoenix metropolitan region and explored the relationships between community composition and urban land uses surrounding the reserves. Diversity of different guilds was affected in substantially different ways by reserve characteristics and surrounding urban land use. Guilds responded to land use at all three scales included in the study – 200 m, 1000 m and 2500 m. The responses of four guilds, synanthropic, non-synanthropic, insectivore and feeding generalist, were well predicted by the factors considered here. Reserve characteristics (area, shape, isolation), particularly area, had effects on all four of these guilds with non-synanthropic and insectivore species responding positively to area, while synanthropic and feeding generalist species responded negatively. Land use type surrounding the reserves had significant effects on all of these guilds, except for feeding generalists. High density, high diurnal activity land uses decreased diversity, while medium density, low diurnal activity uses increased the diversity of some guilds, particularly insectivores, probably by providing supplemental habitat. This study provides new evidence from an arid urban landscape that not only reserve characteristics, but also surrounding urban land use should be considered during conservation planning, especially if non-synanthropic or insectivore species are among the targeted species.

AB  - The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general.

AB  - Quantitative securing of green space in already developed cities has many practical limitations due to socio-economic limitations. Currently, South Korea is planning a green network to secure and inject effective green space, but it is difficult to reflect it in the actual space plan due to the abstract plan. This study utilizes circuit theory and least-cost path methods for presenting a green network that is objectified and applicable to spatial planning. First, an analysis of the Least-cost Path revealed 69 least-cost paths between 43 core green areas of the study site. Most least-cost paths have been identified as passing through small green areas and streams in the city. Using the circuit theory, it was also possible to distinguish areas other than least-cost paths from areas with high potential for development, areas where target species are concentrated within corridors. In particular, areas with relatively high green network improvement effects were derived within and around corridors. This study is most significant in establishing and evaluating existing urban green networks, overcoming the limitations discussed at the linear level and expanding to the area level. To increase the utilization of this study in the future, field surveys and monitoring studies on target species need to be supplemented.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Background
              Mobile animals transport nutrients and propagules across habitats, and are crucial for the functioning of food webs and for ecosystem services. Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (
                Eudocimus albus
                ), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type.
              
            
            
              Results
              We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens.

AB  - Cities are growing rapidly worldwide, yet a mechanistic understanding of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity is lacking. We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500-m scale and patch isolation at the 100-m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro-ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss.

T2  - Frontiers in Microbiology
AB  - The microbial communities inhabiting urban soils determine the functioning of these soils, in regards to their ability to cycle nutrients and support plant communities. In an increasingly urbanized world these properties are of the utmost importance, and the microbial communities responsible are worthy of exploration. We used 53 grassland sites spread across Berlin to describe and explain the impacts of urbanity and other environmental parameters upon the diversity and community composition of four microbial groups. These groups were (i) the Fungi, with a separate dataset for (ii) the Glomeromycota, (iii) the Bacteria, and (iv) the protist phylum Cercozoa. We found that urbanity had distinct impacts on fungal richness, which tended to increase. Geographic distance between sites and soil chemistry, in addition to urbanity, drove microbial community composition, with site connectivity being important for Glomeromycotan communities, potentially due to plant host communities. Our findings suggest that many microbial species are well adapted to urban soils, as supported by an increase in diversity being a far more common result of urbanity than the reverse. However, we also found distinctly separate distributions of operational taxonomic unit (OTU)s from the same species, shedding doubt of the reliability of indicator species, and the use of taxonomy to draw conclusion on functionality. Our observational study employed an extensive set of sites across an urbanity gradient, in the region of the German capital, to produce a rich microbial dataset; as such it can serve as a blueprint for other such investigations.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vito´ria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard’s similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may beneﬁt generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Green–blue space loss and fragmentation are particularly acute in Chinese cities due to rapid urbanization, large ring-road system and the following city compartments. Therefore, connecting urban green–blue spaces has been recently advocated by central government. This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi’an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green–blue spaces to compact green–blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (
              Passer montanus
              ), Asiatic toad (
              Bufo gargarizans
              ) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green–blue networks at city scale. At neighbourhood scale, one site with habitat and linkage examples illustrated specific measures that could be taken in local practice.

AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes.

AB  - Given current urbanization trends, understanding the factors that affect local biodiversity is paramount for designing sound management practices. Existing evidence suggests that the assembly of urban communities is influenced by the environmental filtering of organisms based on their traits. Here, we investigate how environmental characteristics including isolation measurements affect the functional composition of avian assemblages in green spaces of Merida, Mexico, a Neotropical city. We sampled 22 sites, analyzed point-count data collected during fall migration, and characterized the habitat with regard to floristic and structural vegetation attributes, vegetation cover within green spaces, urban infrastructure, and isolation. We assessed the relationship between habitat descriptors and bird functional traits using RLQ and fourth-corner tests and compared trait–environment associations between resident and wintering species. Our results showed that functional composition of resident bird assemblages was linked to the environmental characteristics of the site, while the functional composition of wintering species was not. In particular, the degree of isolation revealed to be an important determinant of trait composition. Plant species richness, particularly native tree and shrub species, were critical for the functional composition of resident birds in green spaces. Our findings suggested shifts in body mass from less to more isolated green spaces. Specifically, we observed that large-bodied species predominated in isolated green spaces. This information is useful given the predicted increases in habitat isolation and transformation of green spaces due to urbanization.

AB  - The connectivity of green infrastructure facilitating the movement of organisms is the key to strengthening biodiversity in cities. Brownfields are a valuable land resource, with their revitalisation as a Nature Based Solution high on the policy agenda. In supporting cities which simultaneously aim for densification and the maintenance or further development of greenery, this paper develops a model for identifying and prioritising the role of revitalised and prevailing brownfields for the connectivity of green infrastructure using the example of Leipzig, Germany. Comparing metrics between land use categories, brownfields have a central role as stepping stones, with a value of 13%, while revitalised brownfields substantially contribute to global connectivity, with a value of 87% being equally important, for example, with Leipzig’s central parks. This paper’s spatial-explicit network approach provides a complementary planning tool for prioritising brownfields and the added value of their renaturing by identifying (a) strategic functional corridors formed by brownfields, (b) the connectivity relevance and exposure of individual brownfields, and (c) how renatured brownfields would strengthen existing corridors and form alternative paths. This paper presents an approach using freely available software tools and high-resolution canopy data as a proxy for functional connectivity which serves as a standardised and comparable ex-ante evaluation of NBS strategies being implemented in other cities.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Pacific chorus frog (
              Pseudacris regilla
              ) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species’ range; yet it is possible that
              P. regilla
              , like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships for
              P. regilla
              in a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explained
              P. regilla
              occupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to support
              P. regilla
              if they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

AB  - Abstract
            Insect-provided pollination services are increasingly threatened due to alarming declines in insect pollinator populations. One of the main threats to insect pollinators and consequently pollination is urbanisation. Here, we investigate the effects of local habitat quality (patch size, flowering plant richness, bare soil cover, vegetation structure), degree of urbanisation (impervious surfaces) and 3D connectivity on bee, hoverfly and butterfly flower visitors and plant-flower visitor networks in flower-rich urban dry grasslands. Overall, the degree of urbanisation and the quality of the local habitat influenced the flowering plant and pollinator communities. Although flowering plant abundance increased with urbanisation, bee species richness and butterfly species richness decreased with increasing impervious surfaces. Flowering plant richness and ground nesting resource availability were positively related to bee richness and local vegetation structure boosted hoverfly and butterfly visitation rates. In terms of plant–pollinator interactions, insect pollinators visited a lower proportion of the available flowering plants in more urbanised areas and network modularity and specialisation increased with patch size. Our findings show that urban dry grasslands are valuable habitats for species-rich pollinator communities and further highlight the importance of minimizing the intensity of urbanisation and the potential of local management practices to support insect biodiversity in cities.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most intensive threats to biodiversity worldwide. The rapid sprawl of urban settings often comprises a drastic landscape transformation due to the replacement of natural vegetation by impervious surfaces. However, cities can serve as critical refuges for some native fauna, particularly for pollinators. Here we used citizen data to contrast the structure of hummingbird-plant meta-networks across different greenspaces (natural protected areas, urban parks, urban gardens and street trees areas) in a tropical megacity. We compiled hummingbird-plant visitation records in Mexico City available in two citizen science resources: iNaturalist and eBird. We first determined whether the retrieved dataset was representative to estimate network metrics by calculating sample coverage and estimating species richness in different greenspaces. Then, we characterized network structure and plant importance for network organization according to plant origin, life form and pollination syndrome. We recorded 17 hummingbirds visiting 84 plant species, encompassing a total of 742 interactions. Natural protected areas and urban parks showed a higher richness of hummingbirds and plants. All networks had low levels of connectance, specialization, and nestedness. Modularity was significant across all networks with higher values in natural protected areas and urban gardens. Native and introduced plant species showed a similar contribution to network organization. Non-ornithophilous plants were most important in natural protected areas, while tree species were most important in street trees greenspaces. Our results provide evidence of generalization of hummingbird-plant networks in urban areas. Introduced species and non-ornithophilous plants were equally important for hummingbirds, suggesting an integration of alien plants with no specialized bird pollination traits into ecological networks in urban scenarios. Promoting conservation initiatives as pollinator gardens with key native species for hummingbirds across the city could contribute to the functional connectivity and restoration of ecological interactions in cities.

AB  - Abstract
            I assessed the effects of pedestrians on the distribution of forest bird species in wooded parks in the city of Madrid within and between fragments. Within fragments, increasing levels of pedestrians reduced species richness and overall abundance of individuals within circular plots. The abundance of foraging individuals of four species (Magpies Pica pica, Blackbirds Turdus merula, Starlings Sturnus unicolor, and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) diminished when pedestrians walked near sampling plots, as well as their breeding densities in relation to increasing disturbance levels. Between fragments, after controlling for fragment size effects, pedestrian rate was negatively related to species richness in two breeding seasons. Species turnover was positively associated to mean pedestrian rate and inter-annual variability in pedestrian rate. At the species level, pedestrian rate negatively affected the probabilities of fragment occupation of 16 species beyond the effects of fragment size and isolation. Locally, the short-term behavioral responses to visitors may reduce the suitability of highly disturbed parks in such a way as to decrease breeding densities and the probabilities of fragment occupation and persistence. The effects of human disturbance in fragmented landscapes should be incorporated into management decisions as another relevant factor that may reduce habitat quality.

AB  - Urbanization results in complex and variable changes to environmental conditions, which translate to shifts in selection pressures for organisms. Size of a city as well as the intensity and extent of urbanization can synergistically influence how organisms are impacted. However, less is known about how landscape heterogeneity, rate of land-use change, and scale of urbanization affect species persistence. We evaluate the ways in which urbanization changes the environment and examine how some of these environmental factors influence the presence of the lizard
              Psammophilus dorsalis
              (Peninsular rock agama), in Bengaluru, India. Variability in environmental factors across the study area was characterised by measures of habitat composition and diversity, habitat connectivity, rate of habitat change, predation pressure, land surface temperature (LST) and artificial light at night (ALAN), that were derived from remotely sensed and citizen science data. Most of these factors showed high variance across two measures of urbanization: distance from city center and proportion of built-up area. Habitat diversity and ALAN were the only two factors that changed predictably and in a non-linear way, with distance from the city center and proportion of built-up area. We then used a multi-scale approach to examine the relative importance of some these environmental factors at the landscape scale, as well as additional factors at the microhabitat-scale, in predicting the presence and relative abundance of 
              P. dorsalis
              respectively. At the landscape scale, LST, which is positively correlated with proportion of cropland, predicted lizard presence; whereas at the microhabitat scale, 
              P. dorsalis
               was more likely to be found in sites with higher proportions of rocks. Overall, we demonstrate that urbanization can result in environmental predictors that do not vary linearly across the urbanization gradient. For the iconic rock agama, many of these environmental factors do not seem to be strong selection pressures that influence their distribution in the expanding cityscape. Whether this urban utilizer can continue to persist with increasing anthropogenic development is uncertain. To better understand drivers of species persistence, we emphasize the importance of quantifying urbanization across multiple axes, considering environmental factors that are relevant to species at different spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Assessment of the functionality of wildlife corridors used by red deer in the Geneva basin
            The red deer population located west of the Jura Mountains is expanding its range. For the past fifteen years this expansion has also affected the lowlands of the Geneva basin. When entering the Plateau area, the red deer face a landscape highly fragmented by urbanisation. In addition their natural habitats are broken up and are often reduced to small patches. In this context it is hard to imagine how a red deer population manages to find all the resources required for survival, and how the animals manage to connect the scattered habitats in their area. A study was initiated in 2009 in order to assess this population's use of the space available. Sixteen individuals were fitted with GPS collars in order to monitor their movements. The results show that these individuals manage to connect a set of habitats, forests and agricultural areas, thanks to the presence of transit corridors, the whole system forming a network superposed on the urban network. It was however observed that the functionality of these corridors is often threatened and that their size has been reduced in the last decade. However, even though the landscape matrix is dominated by agricultural environments and is strongly fragmented, the animals are, at present, able to find enough resources by moving between habitat patches using the network which remains. The area thus used to satisfy their essential needs is surprisingly small.

AB  - In the United States, systemic racism has had lasting effects on the structure of cities, specifically due to government-mandated redlining policies that produced racially segregated neighborhoods that persist today. However, it is not known whether varying habitat structures and natural resource availability associated with racial segregation affect the demographics and evolution of urban wildlife populations. To address this question, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived nuclear genetic data from 7,698 individuals spanning 39 terrestrial vertebrate species sampled in 268 urban locations throughout the United States. We found generally consistent patterns of reduced genetic diversity and decreased connectivity in neighborhoods with fewer White residents, likely because of environmental differences across these neighborhoods. The strength of relationships between the racial composition of neighborhoods, genetic diversity, and differentiation tended to be weak relative to other factors affecting genetic diversity, possibly in part due to the recency of environmental pressures on urban wildlife populations. However, the consistency of the direction of effects across disparate taxa suggest that systemic racism alters the demography of urban wildlife populations in ways that generally limit population sizes and negatively affect their chances of persistence. Our results thus support the idea that limited capacity to support large, well-connected wildlife populations reduces access to nature and builds on existing environmental inequities shouldered by predominantly non-White neighborhoods.

AB  - Biodiversity maintenance is a crucial ecosystem service. Due to time limits and data availability, assessing biodiversity using indicators or models has become a hot topic in recent decades. However, whether some proposed indicators can explain biodiversity well at the local scale is still unclear. This study attempted to test whether the habitat quality index (HQI) as measured using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model could explain variations in bird diversity in New Jiangwan Town, a rapidly urbanized region of Shanghai, China. The relationships from 2002 to 2013 among HQI and the two diversity indices, species richness and species abundance, were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test and gray correlation analysis. No significant association was found. Habitat connectivity was then integrated to develop a new combined indicator of habitat quality and connectivity index (HQCI). The associations between HQCI and the two diversity indices were improved significantly. The results indicated that connectivity may be an important factor explaining the diversity of certain species at a local scale. More empirical studies should be conducted to provide scientific evidence relating habitat quality to biodiversity.

AB  - Urbanization causes fragmentation creating “islands” of natural habitat. The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5 km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks’ relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Context
              Structural and functional connectivity, as subconcepts of landscape connectivity, are key factors in biodiversity conservation and management. Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms.
            
            
              Objectives
              As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape.
            
            
              Methods
              We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity.
            
            
              Results
              We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages. Even clustered ponds need dispersal from other habitats to ensure their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 × 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

AB  - Ecological protection and the restoration of full-array ecosystems is an important part of ecological civilization construction, which is a powerful measure to implement the concept of green development and help bridge the gap between the respective inevitable requirements of the current ecological environment and economic development. To solve this problem, a multi-scale index system was constructed to identify ecological sources comprehensively. The minimum-cost path method, the circuit theory, and the cyclic window search method were adopted to quantitatively identify the important ecological sources and corridors in scale nesting and pinch points and barrier points that affect multi-level connectivity. Furthermore, the specific optimization layout strategy of the ecological network structure of the Hefei metropolitan area was proposed. According to the results, if ecological sources and corridors at two scales are overlaid, the coincident area of ecological sources at two scales is 1719.95 km2. As important ecological sources, Chaohu Lake Basin, Niuwangzhai, and Wuding Mountain, which are important areas to maintain the ecological network, need to be protected. Ten overlapping ecological corridors, which are mainly distributed in Changfeng County, are easily damaged long term. As a result, ecological nodes should be set up as temporary habitats for species transfer. In addition, based on the circuit theory and the cyclic window search method, calculating areas of pinch points at two scales yields 1637.75 km2 and 434.22 km2, respectively, and for areas of barrier points yields 2182.75 km2 and 126.97 km2, respectively. The ecological pinch points at two overlapping scales among them are important areas for future protection. Due to the small and fragmented spatial distribution in the urban area, pinch points with an average size of 0.58 km2 are easy to be restored and will greatly improve the connectivity of the ecological network after restoration. Furthermore, through the quantitative identification of ecological network elements of two scales, the paper puts forward an optimization strategy for an ecological network in the Hefei metropolitan area from three aspects of “point-line-polygon.” The research results can reference decision-making concerning the delineation of urban growth boundary, regional ecological security pattern, land space renovation, and ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - Abstract
            The negative impact of habitat fragmentation due to human activities may be different in different species that co-exist in the same area, with consequences on the development of environmental protection plans. Here we aim at understanding the effects produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species with different specializations, one generalist and one specialist, sampled in the same locations. We collected and genotyped 194 wood mice (generalist species) and 199 bank voles (specialist species) from 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape characterized by different potential barriers to dispersal. Genetic variation and structure were analyzed in the two species, respectively. Effective migration surfaces, isolation-by-resistance (IBR) analysis, and regression with randomization were used to investigate isolation-by-distance (IBD) and the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. We observed similar patterns of heterozygosity and IBD for both species, but the bank vole showed higher genetic differences among geographic areas. The IBR analysis suggests that (i) connectivity is reduced in both species by urban areas but more strongly in the specialist bank vole; (ii) cultivated areas act as dispersal corridors in both species; (iii) woodlands appear to be an important factor in increasing connectivity in the bank vole, and less so in the wood mouse. The difference in dispersal abilities between a generalist and specialist species was reflected in the difference in genetic structure, despite extensive habitat changes due to human activities. The negative effects of fragmentation due to the process of urbanization were, at least partially, mitigated by another human product, i.e., cultivated terrains subdivided by hedgerows, and this was true for both species.

AB  - Theories concerning the impact of urbanization on ground-dwelling mammals are mainly based on large-city studies. We investigated whether the negative effects of urbanization are evident in smaller urban areas, where green areas are usually less isolated from their natural surroundings. Livetrapping of small mammals (Rodentia and Soricomorpha) was conducted between 2007 and 2010 in 15 patches within the city of Lublin (Poland) (147.5 km
              2
              , population 354 000) and 15 patches in its agricultural surroundings. A decline in species richness and diversity along an urbanization gradient and an increase in the abundance of species best adapted to the city environment (synurbic species) were observed. The main factors influencing ground-dwelling mammals was isolation of green patches, while the management type of green areas had no significant effect. The genus Apodemus Kaup, 1829, particularly the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius (Pallas, 1771)), was the most urban biased. Within the city, A. agrarius alters its habitat preferences and life-history parameters (body mass, seasonal fluctuations, winter survival). Understanding the factors influencing ground-dwelling mammals in medium-sized cities will enable measures to be implemented that could reduce the negative effects of urbanization during urban expansion.

AB  - The ability of organisms to disperse across urban landscapes is theorized to be constrained by habitat fragmentation. While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of “urban-adapted” species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the inﬂuence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning signiﬁcantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes. Combined, our ﬁndings suggest that, even among some “urban-adapted” species, dispersal within urban environments may be inﬂuenced by landscape structure and composition.

AB  - We evaluated how the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities of butterflies and their community-weighted traits are affected by urbanization in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing:hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing:hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers.

AB  - Increasing numbers of cities are currently developing sustainable policies aimed at promoting urban biodiversity and ecological dynamics through the planning of green networks and the implementation of more sustainable management practices. These human activities can strongly influence environmental factors on which the organization of ecological communities at different scales depends. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand the relative impact of local management, green space design and landscape features on the distribution and the abundance of species in urban areas. On the basis of 2 years of butterfly surveys in urban public parks within an extensive Mediterranean metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France), the aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the effect of these three environmental scales (plot, park, landscape) on the composition and organization of species assemblages. Using variation partitioning and nestedness analysis on ecological data aggregated at plot-level and park-level respectively, we demonstrate the preponderant effect of landscape scale features on urban butterfly assemblages. Our results also highlight an important co-variation of plot management, park layout and urban landscape features, in their interaction with the community structure of urban butterflies. Although there is no significant species-area relationship, significantly nested patterns arise in species composition. Selective colonization appears as a driving force constraining the constitution of species assemblages within the city. However, a prospective study on adjacent more natural areas suggests that biotic limitations, interspecific competition and habitat filtering may play an important role if a larger portion of the urbanization gradient is explored, which remains to be investigated.

AB  - Maintaining ecological balance relies on biodiversity, and habitat network construction plays an imperative role in preserving biodiversity in regional areas. Nevertheless, there is a problem with the current habitat network construction, which focuses exclusively on ecological benefits without taking other benefits into account as well. In this paper, six species of birds with varying habitat types and varying adaptabilities to city life are selected as target species to build a habitat network based on the InVEST model, Circuit Theory, and Linkage Mapper, focusing on nuclei, patches, corridors, and islands for the harmonious coexistence of human-green space-birds in the most densely populated area of Nanjing, and to refine landscape design techniques for habitat creation. Below is a summary of the main results. Firstly, there is a direct relationship between species distribution and migration capabilities and the urbanization adaptation capabilities of species. Meanwhile, habitat quality has a significant impact on bird species distribution. Furthermore, the habitat network in Nanjing’s main urban area has a distributed and partially degraded core area, a single connectivity structure with poor functionality, and significant fragmentation of habitat patches. Finally, as a result of the above results, two perspectives of ecological landscape planning and design are proposed to optimize the relevant green space landscape in Nanjing’s central urban areas based on biodiversity and satisfying the tripartite symbiosis of humans, green space, and birds in the city. By planning and implementing habitat networks, it is possible to enhance the habitat quality of urban green spaces to a certain extent and provide new ideas for the overall planning of urban–natural systems.

AB  - This study calculated the ecological network index (City Biodiversity Index 2) of 85 cities in Korea using the Land Cover Map. Based on the values of the index, four types of city were studied, including Miryang (Cluster A), Anseong (Cluster B), Samcheok (Cluster Cluster), and Yongin (Cluster D). Based on the current status of land use and natural green space in urban areas, small and medium-sized cities do not show many disconnected factors and have a positive (+) effect on the ecological network index (ENI) value. In order to promote urban biodiversity, it is necessary not only to expand the green area quantitatively, but also to improve the quality, such as expanding and connecting natural green areas, and reducing linear disconnection factors.

AB  - The urban matrix was recently shown to be a mosaic of heterogeneous dispersal habitats. We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.

AB  - Considerando que a expansão urbana e o aumento das atividades antrópicas geram perda e fragmentação dos hábitats naturais, ameaçando a biodiversidade, a conservação dos remanescentes florestais urbanos é de extrema importância para a persistência de espécies de fauna e flora nativas. Sendo assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a estrutura da paisagem de área urbanizada no bioma Mata Atlântica, utilizando técnicas de geoprocessamento e fundamentos de Ecologia de Paisagem, visando a fornecer subsídios à conservação florestal na paisagem urbana. Um mapa de uso e cobertura foi utilizado para quantificar a cobertura florestal e para avaliar a estrutura da paisagem. As métricas de paisagem quantificaram área (AREA), forma (SHAPE) e proximidade (NEAR) dos remanescentes florestais, fornecendo indicadores da estrutura da paisagem. A cobertura florestal representa 22,9% da área de estudo, sendo apenas 3,6% dos fragmentos maiores que 50 ha. A grande maioria dos fragmentos (83%) tem área menor que 10 ha. Apenas três remanescentes são maiores que 500 ha, sendo que o maior deles localiza-se na Floresta Nacional de Ipanema. A maioria dos fragmentos florestais (80%) localiza-se em propriedades particulares. A paisagem foi diagnosticada como altamente antropizada e fragmentada, porém com remanescentes próximos entre si (NEAR  50 m), potencializando a movimentação das espécies na matriz antrópica. Cenários de exclusão dos pequenos fragmentos demonstraram a fragilidade da matriz sem o apoio deles, pois os pequenos remanescentes contribuem para a conexão entre os maiores. O campo antrópico de vegetação pioneira é a segunda classe de uso de maior cobertura na área de estudo (20,4%), atrás somente da área urbanizada (25%). Ações para a manutenção da biodiversidade em paisagens antropizadas, como as da área de estudo, devem priorizar projetos de restauração de campos antrópicos, incentivos à conservação de remanescentes em propriedades particulares e a manutenção de pequenos fragmentos na paisagem, a fim de promover a conexão entre as grandes áreas florestais. Os planejamentos urbano e ambiental das cidades devem ser alinhados e baseados em estudos científicos sobre a espacialização da vegetação no ambiente urbano.

AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wrocław city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2–20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

AB  - Seoul City, as the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea, has high population density, and its remaining forests are extremely fragmented as a result of intensive development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution of the great tit (Parus major) and develop a habitat model. Tits have been known as forest birds that inhabit urban forests in Seoul City. A Seoul biotope map and land cover map were combined, and the urban forest areas were delineated on these maps. As factors affecting the distribution of the great tit, landscape indices were calculated by separating them into intrapatch indices, namely logged patch area (PA), area-weighted mean patch shape index (PSI), tree rate (TR), and tree area (TA), and interpatch indices, namely patch degree (PD), patch betweenness (PB), patch proximity (PP), and difference probability of connectivity (DPC), to analyze the internal properties of the patches and their connectivity by tit occurrence data. The results of a t test analyzing the differences of habitat variables by great tit presence/absence and distribution showed differences in PA (p < 0.05), PSI (p < 0.001), TR (p < 0.01), TA (p < 0.001), PD (p < 0.05), PB (p < 0.01), PP (p < 0.05), and DPC (p < 0.1). In the results of logistic regression modeling, in most cases, more than one model had ΔAICc less than 2.0, suggesting that multiple models may be the best model. In the comprehensive models, the TR, PB, and DPC metrics were the best predictors. Among all variables in the intrahabitat model, PSI was the best predictor of species occurrence. Within the interhabitat model, DPC was the best predictor and had a positive relationship with species occurrence, which is the most important of all the factors. In other words, the great tit is more likely to be found in a large circular forest patch than a small and long-shaped forest patch, and connectivity in the threshold distance is the most important factor in predicting great tit occurrence. These results suggest that ecological potential, not only “location potential” but also “supply potential,” should be considered in fragmented urban forests.

              Context
              Ecological networks are systems of interconnected components that support biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Such structures play a crucial role for nature conservation and people well-being in anthropogenic landscapes. Assessing connectivity by using efficient models and metrics is a sine qua non condition to preserve and improve appropriately these ecological networks.
            
            
              Objectives
              
                This study aims to present a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for species conservation (
                Bufo calamita
                ; the natterjack toad) and human recreation in the city.
              
            
            
              Methods
              The study used a combination least cost and circuit models to identify priority corridors in the City of Liège, Belgium. Green areas, habitats and relevant movement parameters were derived based on existing studies around (i) the occurrence, ecology and biology of the natterjack toad and (ii) human behavioural studies on urban pedestrians. Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps.
            
            
              Results
              The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Context
              Landscape connectivity is assumed to influence ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs and synergies. However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex.
            
            
              Objectives
              The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of
                P. major
                and
                C. caeruleus
                at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance).
              
            
            
              Results
              We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision. A BBN approach is proposed as a feasible method of ES trade-off and synergy prediction in complex landscapes. Our findings can prove to be informative for urban ES management.

AB  - Preserving functional connectivity is a key goal of conservation management. However, the spatially confined conservation areas may not allow for dispersal and gene flow for the intended long-term persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes. We provide a regional multi-species assessment to quantify functional connectivity for five amphibian species in a human dominated landscape in the Swiss lowlands. A set of resistance maps were derived based on expert opinion and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the effect of each resistance scenario on modelled connectivity. Deriving multi-species corridors is a robust way to identify movement hotspots that provide valuable baseline information to reinforce protective measures and green infrastructure.

              The ring-necked parakeet
              Psittacula krameri
              (Aves: Psittaciformes) is a widely distributed species of Asian and African origin, which occurs with over 40 alien populations in the rest of the world. Most established populations of this species are showing a clear trend of territorial expansion and numerical growth. Recent reviews highlighted that one of the main impacts by alien ring-necked parakeets is the competition with threatened bat species using trunk cavities as roosts. In Italy, the only known reproductive population of
              Nyctalus
              bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) occurs in an urban area in the central part of the country, surrounded by increasing and expanding populations of ring-necked parakeets. In this work, we updated the population status of both ring-necked and Alexandrine parakeets and breeding noctule bats in the region. Then, we ran a species distribution model using Maxent software to analyze the environmental suitability of the region for the ring-necked parakeet and a connectivity model using Circuitscape software to predict the possibility of its expansion in the area occupied by breeding noctule bats. We recorded a high number of individual parakeets and breeding colonies, together with a remarkable noctule population decline, from about 400 to about 120 individuals, in the last 20 years, possibly due to urban green management practices. Although some ring-necked parakeets have already been observed in the study area, there is no evidence of reproduction in the surroundings of the noctule colony. However, our model showed a high environmental suitability for the ring-necked parakeet in the area occupied by breeding noctules. As well, the connectivity model showed the potential for a direct flow of individuals from the main urban centers to the area used by noctule bats. The arrival of alien parakeets to the area occupied by the bat breeding colony should be tightly monitored by surveying the suitable areas for this bird, as well as the identified ecological corridors. Early detection of new invasions, together with a sustainable urban green management practice, may prevent the extinction of the southernmost breeding colony of the common noctule.

AB  - This study shows that an integrated ecological and cultural corridor network can help guide city development strategies to better preserve ecological and cultural assets. Traditionally, protection zones and suitable development areas are often identified by separately considering natural elements of the ecosystem and elements of cultural significance. To achieve the purpose of cohesively protecting areas of ecological and/or cultural significance, we have developed a corridor-based spatial framework by integrating ecological and cultural assets. Ecological sources are identified by combining protection prioritization, nature reserves, and water bodies. Ecological corridors are delineated by using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model on a resistance surface constructed from land-use data to connect ecological sources. Ecologically important areas are then delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from ecological sources and ecological corridors. Cultural corridors are historical routes and rivers surrounded by abundant cultural nodes. Like ecologically important areas, culturally important areas are delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from cultural corridors. Comprehensive regions are the overlap of ecologically and culturally important areas. Finally, the integrated network connects all comprehensive regions following ecological corridors and cultural corridors in such a way that the largest number of ecological sources and cultural nodes are reached. We applied this framework in Beijing, China, and the results show that there are 2011 km2 of ecological sources, 30 ecological corridors, 423 cultural nodes, seven cultural corridors, and 10 comprehensive regions covering 2916 km2 in the integrated network. The framework adds new insights to the methodology of considering ecological and cultural assets together in developing protection and development strategies.

AB  - We use the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a mammal with limited mobility, as a model species to study whether the structural matrix of the urban environment has an influence on population genetic structure of such species in the city of Berlin (Germany). Using ten established microsatellite loci we genotyped 143 hedgehogs from numerous sites throughout Berlin. Inclusion of all individuals in the cluster analysis yielded three genetic clusters, likely reflecting spatial associations of kin (larger family groups, known as gamodemes). To examine the potential bias in the cluster analysis caused by closely related individuals, we determined all pairwise relationships and excluded close relatives before repeating the cluster analysis. For this data subset (N = 65) both clustering algorithms applied (Structure, Baps) indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. These results suggest that the high proportion of green patches in the city of Berlin provides numerous steppingstone habitats potentially linking local subpopulations. Alternatively, translocation of individuals across the city by hedgehog rescue facilities may also explain the existence of only a single cluster. We therefore propose that information about management activities such as releases by animal rescue centres should include location data (as exactly as possible) regarding both the collection and the release site, which can then be used in population genetic studies.

AB  - Abstract
            This article presented the results of a comparative analysis of carabid species compositions (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in urban green areas of the City of Lublin, Eastern Poland. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of ground beetles were analysed according to habitat preference and dispersal ability. A total of 65 carabid species were found in the three green areas. Obviously, the high species richness of ground beetles in the greenery of the Lublin is determined by the mostly undeveloped floodplain of the river Bystrzyca. The species richness of carabids and their relative abundance decrease in the assemblage of green areas under the effect of isolation of green patches and fragmentation of the semi-natural landscape elements in the urban environment. Generalists and open-habitat species significantly prevailed in all green areas. The prevailing of riparian and forest species at floodplain sites of the river Bystrzyca demonstrated the existence of a connection of the carabid assemblage with landscape of river valley. The Saski Park and gully “Rury” are more influenced by urbanization (fragmentation, isolation of green patches) and recreation that is consistent with the significant prevalence of open-habitats species in the carabid beetle assemblage.

              Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow,
              Melozone leucotis,
              and the urban dweller house wren
              Troglodytes aedon
              . We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.

              Understanding the timescales that shape spatial genetic structure is pivotal to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and reproductive viability of long-lived plant populations. Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub
              Conospermum undulatum
              , a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained ~ 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions. Our study highlights the importance of considering the historical habitat dynamics when investigating fragmentation consequences in long-lived plants. A detailed characterization of fragmentation from 1953 has shown how low levels of genetic fixation are due to extensive gene flow through the non-fragmented landscape. Moreover, knowledge of the relationships between genetic and environmental variation and reproduction can help to implement effective conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic landscapes.

AB  - Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation inﬂuences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative inﬂuence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important inﬂuence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important inﬂuencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results speciﬁc to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives.

AB  - Human activities result in the formation of a mosaic of forest patches within a non-habitat matrix. The response of the local biodiversity to changes in land-use may occur at different scales. It is important to evaluate the effects of the attributes of both the patches and the surrounding landscape on the occupancy of forest patches by animal populations. Here, we assessed the predictive potential of local (basal area, tree density), patch (size, shape) and landscape scale (total area of forest, number of patches, matrix permeability, patch proximity) variables on the occupancy of forest patches by the syntopic primates Alouatta caraya, Sapajus libidinosus and Callithrix penicillata in the city of Goiânia in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. We used playback to survey primate populations in 22 focal patches and assessed the landscape within a 1000 m buffer zone around each site. In A. caraya, occupancy was influenced by the shape of the focal patches, the amount of forest and fragmentation level of the landscape. Focal patch size and the permeability of the matrix were the principal determinants of the occupancy of S. libidinosus. None of the predictors influenced patch occupancy in C. penicillata, and the structure of the vegetation did not influence occupancy in any of the species. The preservation of as many forest patches as possible, both large and small, as well as gallery forests, and the enhancement of matrix permeability will be essential for the long-term conservation of the syntopic primates of the Cerrado of central Brazil.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) often support diverse bird assemblages. Current evidence suggests large UGS that are circular in shape and contain abundant tree canopy cover will support more bird species independent of UGS isolation. Here, we use bird occurrence information from the eBird citizen-science database over an 18-year period (2002–2019) to estimate annual and seasonal patterns of avian species richness in well-surveyed New York City green spaces. Area was the strongest correlate of annual (n = 102 UGS) and seasonal species richness (n = 43 UGS), whereas shape and isolation lacked significant relationships. Increasing area by 50% resulted in an 11.5% increase in annual and an 8.2% increase in seasonal species richness. There was no evidence that these relationships contained an upper limit. Tree canopy cover was weakly correlated with annual species richness. The richness of nocturnally migrating species was strongly correlated with area in the spring and autumn, especially for non-passerine species. The species richness of nocturnally migrating passerines was strongly correlated with tree canopy cover in the spring, where a 50% increase in canopy cover resulted in a 23.3% increase in species richness. Our findings emphasize the broad importance of area, the value of tree canopy cover for spring migrants, and the limited relevance of shape and isolation. Efforts to enhance area and tree canopy cover will increase the number of resident and migratory bird species, which will likely increase the number of other area-sensitive forest taxa that occur in urban environments.

AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.

TI  - Urban built form shapes avian richness in green spaces
AU  - Rogers, Morgan L.
T2  - Frontiers in Conservation Science
AB  - Urban biodiversity plays an important role in ecological processes and ecosystem services within cities, making conservation a priority in many municipal sustainability plans. Urban green spaces (UGS) have been a key strategy for conservation by providing habitat for wildlife, including avian communities. While the ecological attributes necessary to enhance the habitability of UGS for avian communities are relatively well known, an understanding of how variation in the surrounding urban matrix influences avian richness outcomes in these spaces, is less understood. As new urban areas continue to develop and UGS become increasingly important habitat areas, urban designers and planners will need a better understanding of the ways in which urban built form patterns at the matrix-level influence avian biodiversity outcomes at the site-level in UGS. To that end, this study investigates the influence of 4 urban built form matrix-level variables , capturing three-dimensional (3D) configuration patterns, and 6 UGS site-level variables on total avian richness and avian richness by foraging guild using generalized linear model methods in 22 UGS. This analysis was conducted using high resolution land cover data, LiDAR data, and twenty years of bird occurrence data from the eBird community science program in well-surveyed UGS in Los Angeles, California. The size of the UGS was the best predictor of richness patterns across all groups, confirming previous findings. However, several urban form metrics, when included with UGS size, improved model prediction for Carnivores, Insectivores, and Omnivore foraging guilds, indicating that urban built form does influence some avian groups within UGS. The results of this study suggest that the most important factor for avian richness in UGS is the size of the green space, but that urban built form plays a role too, especially when considered from a 3D perspective.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Cities’ green areas are fragmented patches and are often confined to smaller sizes than the higher built-up proportions. Such small-sized green areas can be essential components of green infrastructure to compensate for biodiversity loss. As a proxy to biodiversity, we studied birds in nine small green area locations of Freiburg and eight area locations in Regensburg in Germany. We investigated the neighboring green networks (distance to the nearest water body and another green area) and landscape metrics (patch abundance and habitat heterogeneity at a 1 km radius) that might benefit and explain bird richness and composition in small green areas. We found that the variations in the observed species richness and composition at the surveyed locations were better explained solely by green networks in Freiburg and by green networks and landscape metrics in Regensburg. In general, it indicates that a small green area could be biodiverse if its spatial distribution considers a nearby water body and other green areas, allowing a higher abundance of similar patches and habitat heterogeneity in the neighborhood.

AB  - With the implementation of human activities, such as logging, reclamation, and construction, the increasing fragmentation of ecological space and the increasing blockage of biological migration corridors cause many threats to biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the Northwest Beijing Ecological Containment Area as the research area. Based on an integrated circuit theoretical model, we identified functional connectivity networks and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of ecological blockage patterns in the region from 1998–2018 in terms of the landscape connectivity, ecological breakpoints, pinch points, and barriers, respectively. The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index had a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and a total of 33, 34, and 63 habitat core areas and 70, 74, and 152 ecological corridors were identified in 1998, 2010, and 2018, respectively. The regions with high ecological blockage were mainly in the central part of Yanqing District, the southwest corner of the study area, and the eastern urban area. Although the number of potential ecological corridors gradually increases with the probability of migration in the study area, the blockage status and vulnerability of the ecological corridors continue to increase due to the conflict between land uses. The ecological status of the study area reflects the comprehensive effectiveness of the capital’s high-quality development under the strategic deployment of ecological civilization. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the effective protection and restoration of the ecological conditions in the ecological function areas is of great importance in guaranteeing the ecological quality and sustainable development of the country.

T2  - Ecological Research
AB  - The majority of forests in urban areas are small and isolated. Improving habitat quality of small forests instead of increasing habitat size and connectivity could be an effective means of conserving the biodiversity of such highly fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of habitat quantity, quality and isolation on butterfly assemblages in urban fragmented forests in Tokyo, Japan. We used four habitat geographic parameters: (1) fragment size, (2) shape index, (3) isolation (distance to the mainland), and (4) connectivity; and three habitat quality parameters: (1) herbaceous nectar plant abundance, (2) herbaceous nectar plant diversity, and (3) larval host plant diversity. We surveyed butterfly assemblages along transects in 20 forest fragments that ranged in size from 1 to 122 ha. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to four habitat geographic parameters and three habitat quality parameters. The averaged models based on AICc showed that fragment size had a strong positive effect on butterfly species richness. There was also a positive effect of herbaceous nectar plant abundance on species diversity. These findings suggest that improving the habitat quality of small and isolated forests in highly fragmented landscapes may be capable of maintaining levels of butterfly diversity comparable to those of large fragments.

AB  - Abstract
            Cities are considered important refuges for insect pollinators. This has been shown repeatedly for wild bees, but may also be true for other diverse taxa such as hoverflies. However, our understanding of how urban environmental filters shape pollinator species communities and their traits is still limited. Here, we used wild bee and hoverfly species, communities and their functional traits to illustrate how environmental filters on the landscape and local scale shape urban species pools. The multi-taxon approach revealed that environmental filtering predominantly occurred at the landscape scale as urbanisation and 3D connectivity significantly structured the taxonomic and functional composition of wild bee (sociality, nesting, diet, body size) and hoverfly (larval food type, migratory status) communities. We identified urban winners and losers attributed to taxon-specific responses to urban filters. Our results suggest that insect pollinator conservation needs to take place primarily at the landscape level while considering species traits, especially by increasing habitat connectivity.

T2  - Revista de Biología Tropical
AB  - Introduction: The migration of people from rural environments to cities has accelerated urbanization. This has modified the landscape as well as the ecological processes and communities in these areas. The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the Gran Area Metropolitana, which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat of the areas used by this species (i.e., coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: Determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of the Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for the Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using the potentially suitable habitat and land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74  % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species’ range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the endemic Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of the endemic Cabanis´s Ground-Sparrow, and implement a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts.  Finally, this is a tool that will help to detect which habitats within heavily urbanized areas are the most important to ensure different species conservation.

AB  - Rapid urbanization results in changes in land use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrosystems, and biodiversity. Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health.

TI  - Stepping stones: Assessing the permeability of urban greenspaces to climate-driven migration of trees
AU  - Han, Qiyao
AU  - Keeffe, Greg
T2  - Smart and Sustainable Built Environment
AB  - Purpose
              Large-scale urbanisation has become a significant barrier to the natural migration of tree species, which is being exacerbated by accelerated climate change. Within this context, improving the permeability of urban landscapes is expected to be an effective strategy to facilitate the process of forest migration through cities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to assess the permeability of urban green spaces as stepping stones for forest migration, from the perspective of seed dispersal.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The proposed method combines a least-cost path (LCP) model and a graph theory-based approach. The LCP model is applied to map the potential pathways of seed dispersal at multiple spatial and temporal scales, based on which graph theory-based indices are used to quantify the accessibility of urban landscapes for seed dispersers. This method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. Eurasian jay, Eurasian siskin, coal tit and grey squirrel are selected as the main seed dispersers in the study area.
            
            
              Findings
              The results provide a comparison of the landscape permeability maps generated from different seed dispersers and identify key areas likely to facilitate the process of forest migration. Recommendations regarding landscape management for improving permeability are also discussed.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This method allows designers to re-visualise highly modified and fragmented urban landscapes as stepping stones for seed dispersal, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to optimise urban landscapes for climate adaptation.

AB  - Urban alteration of neutral and adaptive evolutionary processes is still underexplored. Using a genome-wide SNP dataset, we investigated (i) urban-induced modifications of population demography, genetic diversity and population structure and (ii) signature of divergent selection between urban and forest populations in the ant species,
              Temnothorax nylanderi.
              Our results did not reveal an impact of urbanization on neutral processes since we observed: (i) analogous genetic diversity among paired urban/forest sites and two control populations; (ii) weak population genetic structure explained neither by habitat (urban versus forest) nor by geography; (iii) a remarkably similar demographic history across populations with an ancestral growth followed by a recent decline, regardless of their current habitat or geographical location. The micro-geographical home range of ants may explain their resilience to urbanization. Finally, we detected 19 candidate loci discriminating urban/forest populations and associated with core cellular components, molecular function or biological process. Two of these loci were associated with a gene ontology term that was previously found to belong to a module of co-expressed genes related to caste phenotype. These results call for transcriptomics analyses to identify genes associated with ant social traits and to infer their potential role in urban adaptation.

T2  - PeerJ
AB  - In face of a dramatic decline of wild bee species in many rural landscapes, potential conservation functions of urban areas gain importance. Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in particular on wild bees, remain ambiguous and not comprehensively understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing areas. Using Berlin as a study region, we aimed to investigate (a) if these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to more than 20% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.

AB  - Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterﬂy species richness in the city of Malmö, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterﬂy species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within 1 km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in seminatural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in ˇ (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of “townscape” composition for species richness in urban habitats, but also demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

AB  - Urban expansion occurs in horizontal and vertical directions, but the construction process of a traditional planar ecological network (EN) ignores the ecological protection of the vertical space. Birds, as representative species in urbanized areas, are important for expanding the vertical analysis dimension of ENs. In this study, urban parks with good habitat quality were extracted as ecological sources from the perspective of birds. Then, 2D and 3D ecological resistance surfaces were constructed on the basis of the perspective of influencing bird migration, and planar and 3D ecological corridors were extracted and compared for analysis. Finally, accessibility analysis was performed to identify the parks in the study area that need priority protection. Results show that building height is an important factor affecting bird migration, and the introduction of 3D resistance surfaces into EN construction is important for adapting to the trend of vertical urban expansion. The combination of accessibility and EN analyses can help identify ecological spaces having the dual role of “species conservation” and “human well-being enhancement.” This study can provide a reference for refining the service species of ENs, exploring the vertical dimension of ENs, and improving the health of urban ecosystems and the rationality of urban planning.

AB  - Abstract
            The urbanization process systematically leads to the loss of biodiversity. Only certain arthropods are resilient to the urbanization process and can thrive in the novel conditions of urbanized landscapes. However, the degree to which arthropod communities survive in urban habitats depends on landscape and local effects and biological interactions (e.g., trophic interactions). In the present study, we examined the relative importance of various factors at landscape (isolation, edge density and area of surrounding greenery) and local (size of park, canopy cover, understory vegetation cover, defoliation depth, weight of dried leaves, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH) spatial scales on the diversity of ants, beetles and spiders in urban parks. Our results indicated that park edge density was negatively correlated with diversity metrics in ants, beetles, and spiders in urban parks relative to the degree of proximity with the peri-urban forest. In other words, parks that located adjacent to the peri-urban forest may not necessarily have high biodiversity. The results suggested that man-made structures have been effective dispersal barriers that limit the spillover effects of ants and spiders but not the spillover of comparatively strong fliers, such as beetles. However, the area of surrounding greenery may have facilitated the colonization of forest-dependent taxa in distant parks. Large parks with reduced edge density supported a higher arthropod diversity because of the minimal edge effect and increased habitat heterogeneity. Vegetation structure consistently explained the variability of ants, beetles, and spiders, indicating that understory plant litter is crucial for providing shelters and hibernation, oviposition, and foraging sites for the major taxa in urban parks. Therefore, efforts should focus on the local management of ground features to maximize the conservation of biological control in urban landscapes.

AU  - Leveau, Lucas M.
T2  - Animals
AB  - Urbanization has a negative impact on raptor species diversity and abundance. However, some species can adapt to urban areas, and the process of city colonization by raptors has been documented scarcely in the Northern Hemisphere. Information about city colonization by raptors in the Southern Hemisphere is null, and studies about habitat use by raptors are scarce. The objectives of this study were: (1) to describe an event of Harris Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) arrival in Mar del Plata city, Argentina, and (2) to analyze its green area use in a recently colonized city, Buenos Aires. Long-term data collected during 2002–2019, along an urbanization gradient of Mar del Plata, was used to describe the city arrival by the Harris Hawk. Surveys of green areas in Buenos Aires were used to model the Harris Hawk occurrence in relation to green area size and isolation to other green spaces. The Harris Hawk arrival was observed during 2019, mainly in periurban areas of Mar del Plata, and at least three pairs were breeding. In Buenos Aires, the occurrence of the Harris Hawk in green areas was related to the proximity to other large green areas. The results obtained suggest the importance of green areas for raptor colonization in cities.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - The maintenance and enhancement of connectivity for multispecies is a challenging issue for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. It is well-known that diﬀerent elements of the landscape matrix provide diﬀerent levels of permeability to species moving across the landscape, but such eﬀects may be species-speciﬁc. Whilst the spatial articulation of connectivity corridors is highly dependent on how we deﬁne them, and which species group we intended to provide connectivity for, it is also important to understand the optimal land cover mix to promote the maximum number of species. We demonstrate an approach to (1) identifying multispecies networks and examine how it compares to previous network approaches for a case study city of Sheﬃeld, UK and (2) developing speciﬁc proposals for how green networks in Sheﬃeld could be improved. We modelled least-cost corridors for four bird, three mammal and three reptile species. After validating the derived corridors, we created a union of least-cost corridors that identiﬁed the multispecies connectivity zones and compared the derived multispecies networks with the pre-existing networks (Sheﬃeld City Council - the Green Network and the Sheﬃeld and Rotherham Wildlife Trust- the Living Don ecological network). We found that a particular mix of land covers (particularly, woodlands, mixed vegetation and unimproved grassland) have a high potential to provide corridors for the maximum number of species around the edges of the city centre or the suburbs. A signiﬁcant proportion of the Green Network and the Living Don ecological network coincide spatially with these land covers. Based on the comparisons of the derived and existing corridors, we discuss speciﬁc proposals for how Sheﬃeld green networks could be improved and which areas to prioritise. Utilising species relevant connectivity models which incorporate a group of species with complementary and contrasting habitat requirements will enable a much more complete picture of potential landscape connectivity across the landscape and more informed decisions for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning.

T2  - Ecology
AB  - The installation of green roofs, deﬁned here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (b diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for speciﬁc spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more inﬂuenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and conﬁguration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.

AB  - ABSTRACT Urbanization and agriculture growth are some of the major causes of natural ecosystems depletion and biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts can be developed through the prioritization of areas for forest conservation in order to minimize this process. Here, we establish conservation strategies based on a spatial analysis of forest fragments in an urban landscape at the transition between two important Brazilian biodiversity hotspots: Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. A high-resolution mapping of forest patches was used to quantify forest cover and to provide spatial analysis. We developed a Forest Conservation Priority Index (FCPI) derived from landscape metrics to select priority areas for forest conservation efforts. We used area, shape and proximity metrics as landscape structure indicators. Landscape metrics were classified and we attributed a rank and weights for them to calculate the FCPI. Forest covers 17% of the study area. 60% of the forest patches comprise less than one hectare, 95% less than 10 ha and only 1% more than 50 ha. The largest fragments (> 100ha) are all long and narrow. Also, fewer than half the patches are connected to others. Regions classified as high and very high priority for forest conservation are localized at greater slopes, along rivers and on private lands. Our index allowed the prioritization of forest fragments in an urban landscape, directing efforts of conservation. Creating protected areas and restoration plans are necessary for the better situation of the natural ecosystem. Land-use planning must resolve human demands and conservation of this important ecosystem.

            RESUMO: O crescimento urbano e agrícola é uma das maiores causas de degradação dos ecossistemas naturais e da perda de biodiversidade. Os esforços de conservação podem ser planejados com base na priorização de áreas para conservação florestal de forma a minimizar esse processo. Neste trabalho, nós estabelecemos estratégias de conservação com base em uma análise espacial dos fragmentos florestais em uma paisagem urbana na transição entre dois "hotspots" brasileiros: Mata Atlântica e Cerrado. Um mapa de alta resolução dos fragmentos florestais foi usado para quantificar a cobertura florestal e para fornecer uma análise espacial dos mesmos. Nós criamos um Índice de Prioridade de Conservação Florestal (IPCF) derivado de métricas de paisagem para selecionar áreas prioritárias para esforços de conservação da floresta. Foram utilizadas as métricas de área, forma e proximidade como indicadores de estrutura da paisagem. As métricas de paisagem foram classificadas, atribuindo-se classes e pesos a cada uma para calcular o IPCF. A cobertura florestal representa 17% da área de estudo, sendo que 60% dos fragmentos florestais apresentam área menor que um hectare, 95% são menores que 10 ha e apenas 1% é maior que 50 ha. Os maiores fragmentos (>100 ha) são alongados e estreitos e menos da metade dos fragmentos são conectados a outros. Áreas classificadas como de prioridade alta e muito alta para conservação florestal estão localizadas em declividades acentuadas, ao longo de rios e em áreas particulares. Nosso índice permitiu a priorização de fragmentos florestais em uma paisagem urbana, direcionando os esforços para a conservação. A criação de Unidades de Conservação e planos de restauração são necessários para melhorar a situação do ecossistema natural. O planejamento do uso do solo deve unir as demandas humanas e a conservação deste importante ecossistema.

AB  - Under the background of urban expansion, ecological protection cannot be delayed. The construction of ecological networks is of considerable significance to ecosystem services. However, in the process of constructing a corridor network, there is no uniform standard for the selection of ecological sources and the determination of cost factors. The InVEST model is an effective complement to ecosystem service assessment for sensitively measuring external threats and their threat intensity. Therefore, taking Wuhan as an example, we combined InVEST and the least cost path model (LCP) to construct a multi-target corridor network with comprehensive cost factors for birds and small terrestrial mammals. The results showed that: (1) The InVEST model provided a reliable basis for ecological source screening by demonstrating the distribution of habitat quality. (2) The corridor with a length of 12–25 km presented a “U” shape, and the impact of urbanization on small terrestrial mammals was more significant than that of birds. (3) The integrated network pattern proposed by the “point-line-plane” principle would provide a reference for urban ecological construction and sustainable development.

AB  - Understanding how environmental changes driven by urbanization impact the biodiversity in urban riparian areas has great importance for landscape planning and river ecosystem conservation. There have been many studies on the response of bird communities to different environmental variables in urban parks; however, although supporting some of the highest bird diversities, case studies in urban riparian areas remain limited. In existing research, few studies have considered the impact of both local waterfront characteristics and surrounding environmental variables at a larger scale. In this study, we selected birds as the indicator to clarify their response to both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables in riparian areas of Tsing river, Beijing, in terms of (a) vegetation composition, (b) human disturbance, (c) land cover, and (d) landscape connectivity. We hypothesized that birds with different biological characteristics may respond differently to environmental variables. Birds were then further grouped according to the habitat type, residential type, and feeding type. It turned out that the coverage of grass and the disturbance of pedestrians are the most influential variables. Besides, compared with the land cover and landscape connectivity, the total contribution of vegetation characteristics and human disturbance accounts for the main proportion of explained variance. Information pertaining to these environmental variables can provide evidence to support bird conservation efforts in urban areas, and the identified distance threshold provides a basis for future landscape connectivity assessments.

              Transfrontier wildlife corridors can be successful conservation tools, connecting protected areas and reducing the impact of habitat fragmentation on mobile species. Urban wildlife corridors have been proposed as a potential mitigation tool to facilitate the passage of elephants through towns without causing conflict with urban communities. However, because such corridors are typically narrow and close to human development, wildlife (particularly large mammals) may be less likely to use them. We used remote-sensor camera traps and global positioning system collars to identify the movement patterns of African elephants
              Loxondonta africana
              through narrow, urban corridors in Botswana. The corridors were in three types of human-dominated land-use designations with varying levels of human activity: agricultural, industrial and open-space recreational land. We found that elephants used the corridors within all three land-use designations and we identified, using a model selection approach, that season, time of day and rainfall were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors. Elephants moved more slowly through the narrow corridors compared with their movement patterns through broader, wide-ranging corridors. Our results indicate that urban wildlife corridors are useful for facilitating elephants to pass through urban areas.

AB  - Abstract
            The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Abstract
            Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatán peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity. These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness. This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

AB  - Abstract
            Habitat destruction and fragmentation increasingly bring humans into close proximity with wildlife, particularly in urban contexts. Animals respond to humans using nuanced anti-predator responses, especially escape, with responses influenced by behavioral and life history traits, the nature of the risk, and aspects of the surrounding environment. Although many studies examine associations between broad-scale habitat characteristics (i.e., habitat type) and escape response, few investigate the influence of fine-scale aspects of the local habitat within which escape occurs. We test the “habitat connectivity hypothesis,” suggesting that given the higher cost of escape within less connected habitats (due to the lack of protective cover), woodland birds should delay escape (tolerate more risk) than when in more connected habitat. We analyze flight-initiation distances (FIDs) of five species of woodland birds in urban Melbourne, south-eastern Australia. A negative effect of habitat connectivity (the proportion of the escape route with shrubs/trees/perchable infrastructure) on distance fled was evident for all study species, suggesting a higher cost of escape associated with lower connectivity. FID did not vary with connectivity at the location at which escape was initiated (four species), apart from a positive effect of habitat connectivity on FID for Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala. We provide some support for two predictions of the “habitat connectivity hypothesis” in at least some taxa, and conclude it warrants further investigation across a broader range of taxa inhabiting contrasting landscapes. Increasing habitat connectivity within urban landscapes may reduce escape stress experienced by urban birds.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures can affect the distribution of species and elicit the appearance of spatial patterns that provide insights into the species’ responses to environmental filtering, mediated by their functional traits. Due to the functional redundancy in ecological communities, the spatial variations of species and functional traits can occur at different scales, but little is known on this topic, especially for soil arthropods with limited dispersion capabilities and highly dependent on environmental characteristics. The present research aims at shedding light on the spatial ecology of both the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of collembolan communities colonizing urban parks, adopted as model taxa for their functional traits, diversity and sensitivity to environmental drivers. To this end, the spatial patterns and scales of collembolan communities from 8 parks in Naples (Italy) and 14 in Montpellier (France) were investigated through an approach based on Moran eigenvector maps, modified to allow for evaluating the community spatial connectivity and the scales underpinning the spatial variation of each species and functional trait. The obtained findings demonstrate a limited spatial connectivity of collembolan communities in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, with mostly species-specific micro-scale variations that may be shaped by environmental constraints.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Background
              Habitat loss, fragmentation and decrease of habitat quality caused by urbanization have led to a dramatic decline in biodiversity worldwide. For highly urbanized areas, parks have become “islands” or habitat fragments for wildlife. As an important indicator group of urban ecosystem health, the response of birds to urbanization has attracted the global attention of ecologists. Understanding the key factors affecting bird diversity in urbanized environment is crucial to the protection of biodiversity in urban ecosystems.
            
            
              Methods
              We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We also measured a number of park characteristics (area, isolation, shape index, environmental noise, distance to city center, and habitat diversity) that are commonly assumed to influence bird diversity. We then used the information-theoretic multi-model inference approach to determine which park characteristics had significant impacts on bird species richness.
            
            
              Results
              We found that park area, habitat diversity and the distance to city center were the best positive predictors of bird species richness in Nanjing urban parks. By contrast, park isolation, park shape and environmental noise had little or no influence on bird diversity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study highlights the importance of park area, habitat diversity and the distance to city center in determining bird diversity in Nanjing city parks. Therefore, from a conservation viewpoint, we recommend that large parks with complex and diverse habitats far away from the city center should be retained or constructed to increase bird diversity in urban design and planning.

T2  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - Abstract
            Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant–insect interactions by: (1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, (2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics, and (3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant–insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of five functionally distinct flowering plant species (“phytometres”), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, and hoverflies amend other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

Em geral, áreas com maior cobertura de vegetação apresentam maior abundância e diversidade dessas abelhas. Esse estudo investigou os efeitos da fragmentação florestal sobre as assembleias de abelhas Euglossini na região do município de Rio Branco, Acre e arredores. Os fragmentos florestais com tamanhos variados foram selecionados para a área de estudo e classificados como urbanos e rurais. As abelhas foram coletadas entre dezembro de 2005 e agosto de 2006. Um total de 3.675 machos pertencentes a quatro gêneros e 36 espécies foi coletado. De modo geral, abundância e riqueza de Euglossini não foram estatisticamente diferentes entre fragmentos urbanos e rurais. O índice de borda do fragmento foi preditor de riqueza e diversidade das abelhas. A conectividade estimada também foi preditora da riqueza. Fragmentos com maior similaridade em relação à estrutura paisagística foram também mais similares em relação à composição faunística.

AB  - 1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context. 2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant. 3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps. 4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of ‘most forested route’ as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - We explore the extent to which inner-city fauna can be enhanced by source areas in periurban zones as a response to a decreasing quality and size of green habitats within cities. The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to ﬁnd out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterﬂies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterﬂy species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterﬂy population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7–36% for Ômoderate dispersersÕ and 19–56% for Ôgood dispersersÕ. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive inﬂuence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world.

TI  - Focal Nodes Identification Using Habitat Availability Concept for Simulation of Ecological Connectivity Network of Quezon City, Philippines
AU  - Alvarez, A M J
T2  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - Abstract
            Anthropocentric orientation of urban development processes leads to deficiency of areas with significant environmental values in the urban landscapes. As landscape planners try to increase the quality of living in the urban environment, efforts are focused only on the hot spots which often cater only to the recreational needs of urban dwellers. In Quezon City, the local government unit plans to create the Green Lung Network featuring a chain of developments linking La Mesa Nature Reserve, the largest green space in Metro Manila, to all the open spaces and parks in the city. However, the chosen areas to be connected are based only on area size of green spaces and opportunities for economic development. To support and enhance the connectivity plan of the city government, this study aims to identify the focal nodes which represent the key habitat patches of interest on the landscape between which flows are modelled in circuit analysis for simulating an ecological connectivity network. Parameters are based on empirical habitat-use data on the preference of biological indicators/focal species. For computational feasibility, instead of treating every occurrence of suitable habitat on the landscape as a focal node, this study applies the Habitat Availability (reachability) concept using the GIS tool Conefor Sensinode. This allows ranking habitat patches (patches prioritization) by their contribution to landscape connectivity, which provides objective criteria for the selection of the most critical habitat areas for conservation planning purposes. Not only the spatial arrangement of the habitat is considered (structural connectivity), but also the dispersal distances and the behavioural response of species to the physical structure of the landscape (functional connectivity) is taken into account in the analysis. The results revealed that focal nodes of Quezon City include not only the ecological cores but also other tiny patches of green spaces. Moreover, a more surprising result is that some highly vegetated nodes did not qualify as priority nodes for conservation.

AB  - ABSTRACT
          The application of ecological theory to urban planning is becoming more important as land managers focus on increasing urban biodiversity as a way to improve human welfare. City authorities must decide not only what types of biodiversity-focused infrastructure should be prioritized, but also where new resources should be positioned and existing resources protected or enhanced. Careful spatial planning can contribute to the successful return and conservation of urban nature by maximizing the contribution of green infrastructure to landscape connectivity. By using ecological connectivity theory as a planning tool, governments can quantify the effect of different interventions on the ease with which wildlife can move across the landscape. Here we outline an approach to a) quantify ecological connectivity for different urban wildlife species and b) use this to test different urban planning scenarios using QGIS. We demonstrate four extensions to the work by Deslaurier et al. (2018) and Spanowicz & Jaeger (2019) which improve the application of this method as a planning tool for local government:
          
            
              
                A step-by-step method for calculating effective mesh size using the open-source software QGIS.
              
              
                
                  Conversion of the effective mesh size value (
                  m
                  eff
                  ) to a “probability of connectedness” (
                  P
                  c
                  , for easier interpretation by local government and comparisons between planning scenarios).
                
              
              
                Guidance for measuring species-specific connectivity, including how to decide what spatial information should be included and which types of species might be most responsive to connectivity planning.
              
              
                Advice for using the method to measure the outcome of different urban planning scenarios on ecological connectivity.

AB  - The prevailing trend of increasing urbanization and habitat fragmentation makes knowledge of species’ habitat requirements and distribution a crucial factor in conservation and urban planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme – can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (
              Sciurus vulgaris
              ), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance. We finally used Circuitscape (version 4.0.5) on the most robust SDM to delineate suitable movement corridors for red squirrels as a basis for planning road mortality mitigation measures. Our results indicate that even though red squirrels are common, urban habitats are rather small and partially lack connectivity along natural connectivity corridors in Berlin. Thus, additional fragmentation could bring the species closer to its limit to persist in urban environments, where our results can act as a template for conservation and management implications.

AB  - Abstract
            The phyllosphere harbours a diverse and specific bacterial community, which influences plant health and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated the impact of urban green areas connectivity and size on the composition and diversity of phyllosphere bacterial communities. Hereto, we evaluated the diversity and composition of phyllosphere bacterial communities of 233 Platanus x acerifolia and Acer pseudoplatanus trees in 77 urban green areas throughout 6 European cities. The community composition and diversity significantly differed between cities but only to a limited extent between tree species. We could show that urban intensity correlated significantly with the community composition of phyllosphere bacteria. In particular, a significant correlation was found between the relative abundances for 29 out of the 50 most abundant families and the urban intensity: the abundances of classic phyllosphere families, such as Acetobacteraceae, Planctomycetes, and Beijerinkiaceae, decreased with urban intensity (i.e. more abundant in areas with more green, lower air pollution, and lower temperature), while those related to human activities, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, increased with urban intensity. The results of this study suggest that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated with urban intensity and that effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.

AB  - Abstract
            Nestedness is an important pattern frequently reported for species assemblages on islands or fragmented systems. However, to date, there are few studies that comprehensively investigated faunal nestedness and underlying processes in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we examined the nestedness of bird assemblages and its underlying causal mechanisms in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds from April 2019 to January 2020. We used the Weighted Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill (WNODF) to estimate the nestedness of bird assemblages. We applied spearman partial correlation test to examine the relationships between nestedness ranks of sites and park characteristics (area, isolation, anthropogenic noise, number of habitat types, and building index), as well as between nestedness ranks of species and their ecological traits (body size, geographic range size, clutch size, minimum area requirement, dispersal ratio, and habitat specificity). We found that bird assemblages in urban parks were significantly nested. Park area, habitat diversity, building index, habitat specificity, and minimum area requirement of birds were significantly correlated with nestedness. Therefore, the nestedness of bird assemblages was caused by selective extinction, habitat nestedness, and urbanization. However, the nestedness of bird assemblages did not result from passive sampling, selective colonization, or human disturbance. Overall, to maximize the number of species preserved in our system, conservation priority should be given to parks with large area, rich habitat diversity, and less building index. From a species perspective, we should focus on species with large area requirement and high habitat specificity for their effective conservation.

AB  - Urban expansion is a pervasive driver of biodiversity loss. To understand the effects of urbanization on diversity, we investigated the response of bird taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to urban green spaces’ characteristics in thirty-one green spaces of Mexico City. Selected sites encompassed variation of environmental factors along a transformation gradient, from natural protected areas to landscaped parks. Bird observations were conducted during winter (non-breeding season), spring (dry breeding season), and summer (wet breeding season). We used multi-model inference to assess the relationship of green space area, shape, isolation, tree richness, habitat diversity, and vegetation cover with species richness, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, and functional richness. We calculated standardized effect sizes from null models to assess phylogenetic and functional structure. We registered 91 species belonging to 28 families across all sites and seasons. The number of detected species was largest in winter and decreased toward the dry breeding season, and then toward the wet breeding season. We found a moderate to strong positive relationship of species richness with phylogenetic diversity and functional richness. Overall, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird communities in green spaces was neither clustered nor over-dispersed. However, few cases of functional clustering, phylogenetic clustering, or both were observed, and they corresponded to natural protected areas. Results showed a predominant role of green space area in determining community diversity and phylogenetic structure while it did not influence functional structure. Contrary to our predictions, habitat diversity had a negative effect on species richness and phylogenetic diversity and this effect was detected only during the wet breeding season, whereas isolation showed a positive relationship with phylogenetic and functional structure, during the wet breeding season and winter, respectively. This study emphasizes the use of complementary measures of diversity together with the comparison between observed and expected values to get a better insight into the mechanisms by which green spaces’ characteristics affect bird diversity across the seasons.

AB  - Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of “natural” habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle (“old-field”), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.

AB  - ABSTRACT
          Determining critical ecological protected areas at the city (county) spatial scale is crucial for coordinating regional ecological environment management, control, and governance. It is a recognized consensus in academia that human activities significantly impact natural ecosystems. Many scholars ignore this point in the research process and only use several factors to characterize human influence. Therefore, this study takes Aksu City and Wensu County, important cities and towns in southern Xinjiang, as examples, focusing on the impact of human activities on the distribution of critical ecological protection areas. First, we simulated the range, intensity, and local natural conditions of human activities in the study area using geospatial data. We created corresponding resistance surfaces (human activity resistance surface and natural landscape resistance surface). We then assign different weights to the two resistance surfaces based on several possible scenarios, resulting in different synthetic resistance surfaces. Finally, we used the Linkage Mapper plugin to identify critical ecological reserves and compared several results. The results show that: Human activities have greatly interfered with the migration and dispersal of species, affecting the distribution of critical ecological reserves. The specific performance is that in the urban center area with high intensity of human activities, the number and location of the surrounding ecological corridors change significantly with the increase in the proportion of human activity resistance and the total area remains unchanged; As part of the ecological corridors, the ecological pinch points changes with the location of the corridor, and the whole area remains unchanged; The threshold range of the restoration value of ecological barrier points is reduced. The maximum value generated by the restoration of ecological barrier points is reduced, which shows that the restoration value of ecological barrier points decreases with increased human activities.

AB  - Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones.

AB  - One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least-cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance-based modelling method to respond to urban planners’ needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities. We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland-dwelling moths and forest-dwelling passerines, and to two medium-sized cities. We used mark–release–recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch. Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP. Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

AB  - Environmental policies have highlighted the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. A crucial issue for landscape managers is how to reconcile conservation measures that beneﬁt all species and the maintenance of human activities. This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without signiﬁcantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would beneﬁt a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species proﬁles deﬁned by their aﬃnity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species proﬁles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species proﬁles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types — either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species proﬁles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species proﬁles presenting diﬀerent ecological requirements. This coupling approach thus provided guidance to propose some landscape management actions that beneﬁt the majority of species while preserving land uses.

AB  - Researchers and managers of natural resource conservation have increasingly emphasized the importance of maintaining a connected network of important ecological patches to mitigate landscape fragmentation, reduce the decline of biodiversity, and sustain ecological services. This research aimed to guide landscape management and decision-making by developing an evaluation framework to construct ecological security patterns. Taking the Jianghan Plain as the study area, we identified key ecological sources by overlaying the spatial patterns of ecological quality (biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield) and ecological sensitivity (habitat sensitivity, soil erosion sensitivity, and water sensitivity) using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the Chinese Soil Loss Equation Function. Ecological corridors were obtained by the least-cost path analysis method and circuit theory. A total of 48 ecological sources (3812.95 km2), primarily consisting of water area, forestland, and cropland, were identified. Ninety-one ecological corridors were derived, with a total length of 2036.28 km. Forty barriers and 40 pinch points with the highest improvement coefficient scores or priority scores were selected. There were 11 priority corridors with very high levels of connectivity improvement potential and conservation priority, occupying 16.15% of the total length of corridors. The overall potential for ecological connectivity is high on the Jianghan Plain. Our framework offers a valuable reference for constructing ecological security patterns and identifying sites for ecological restoration at the regional scale.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to deteriorated wetland water quality, reduced biodiversity, and fragmented wetland landscapes, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of regional ecology. Based on land use data of Dongying City, Shandong Province, in 2020, this study selected the landscape disturbance degree and landscape fragility index to construct a landscape ecological risk evaluation model and to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk in Dongying City in 2020. The MSPA-Conefor-MCR model was used to extract the ecological network of wetlands in Dongying City, and the topological structure indices were quantitatively analyzed. Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis. By simulating 11 additional edges, the robustness of the optimized ecological network was significantly improved. Optimizing the simulated-edge increase can enhance the smoothness of ecological energy flow, which can provide a scientific basis for the construction of the ecological security pattern of wetlands in Dongying City.

AB  - High-intensity urban development and economic exploitation have led to the fragmentation and isolation of regional habitat patches, and biodiversity is under serious threat. Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km2, 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of “two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes” was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.

AB  - Entender os padrões de estrutura e distribuição espacial das espécies de árvores é fundamental para prever a variação espacial de processos sucessionais, genéticos e ecológicos de um ecossistema florestal. Neste estudo foram analisadas a estrutura populacional e a distribuição espacial de Theobroma speciosum (cacauí) em três fragmentos florestais urbanos (Parques C/E com 6,72 ha amostrados, J com 3,92 ha e Zoobotânico com 15,84 ha) em Alta Floresta e no Parque Nacional do Juruena - PNJu (com 3,2 ha amostrados) no norte do estado de Mato Grosso. Foram amostrados 323 indivíduos de Theobroma speciosum, sendo 50 no fragmento do Parque C/E (7,44 ind. ha-1), 32 no Parque J (8,16 ind.ha-1), 76 no Parque Zoobotânico (4,79 ind. ha-1 ) e 165 no PNJu (51,56 ind. ha-1). A menor densidade de indivíduos encontrada nos parques urbanos pode estar relacionada com o processo de fragmentação, visto que não houve uma relação positiva da densidade e do número de indivíduos com a área amostral. Além disso, a maior densidade foi encontrada no PNJu, que é uma unidade de conservação de floresta contínua e com nenhuma intervenção antrópica recente. Os fragmentos florestais urbanos (com exceção do Parque Zoobotânico) apresentaram uma menor quantidade de indivíduos nas classes inferiores de diâmetro (0-5 cm) e altura (0-5 m) com relação à estrutura encontrada no PNJu. Essa diferença provavelmente deve-se à menor área dos Parques C/E e J e consequentemente a um efeito de borda mais intenso que afetou a regeneração florestal. O padrão de distribuição dos indivíduos em todas as populações foi agregado. Esses resultados indicam que a espécie é susceptível à fragmentação provavelmente devido ao isolamento, pois apresenta autoincompatibilidade e uma dispersão zoocórica limitada.

AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001–2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

AB  - Rapid urbanization development and construction has seriously threatened the connectivity of habitat patches in cities and hindered the construction of ecological networks in highly urbanized areas. Among them, China is affected by early compressed urbanization, and the broken ecological space in cities and towns has attracted the extensive interest of researchers. To avoid the subjective randomness and single analysis of ecological space in urbanization areas, this paper takes the central urban area of Wuhan as the main research area. It comprehensively evaluates the ecological network space by combining the MSPA-MCR model. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Identifying the ecological landscape types with important ecological significance in the study area: Core (88.29%), Islet (0.25%), Perf (0.63%), Edge (9.74%), Loop (0.22%), and Bridge (0.14%). Through the dPC landscape index, seven important ecological sources south of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were identified. (2) According to the comprehensive factors of natural and human factors constructed by the MCR model, the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface was established, with an average value of 2.65, a maximum value of 4.70, and a minimum value of 1.00, showing a trend that the ecological resistance values in the central and eastern parts are lower than those in the western part. (3) According to the standard deviation ellipse, the distribution direction of NE–SW in ecological sources was analyzed. The ecological sources distributed in the north were less, and the spatial distribution was scattered on the whole. The strong global positive correlation and local spatial aggregation characteristics of ecological resistance surface were evaluated according to spatial autocorrelation. Based on the gravity model, the interaction intensity of ecological corridors between source areas was evaluated, and the importance of ecological corridor protection and restoration was quantitatively analyzed. The research results provide scientific and reasonable references and a basis for ecological planning of Wuhan central city.

AB  - Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide.

AB  - The biodiversity loss resulting from rising levels of human impacts on ecosystems has been extensively discussed over the last years. The expansion of urban areas promotes drastic ecological changes, especially through fragmentation of natural areas. Natural grassland remnants surrounded by an urban matrix are more likely to undergo disturbance events. Since grassland ecosystems are closely related to disturbances such as fire and grazing, grassland plant communities, pollinators, and their interaction networks may be especially sensitive to urban expansion, because it promotes habitat fragmentation and modifies disturbance regimes. This work evaluated the effect of the level of urbanization and recent history of fire disturbance on grassland plants communities and plant-floral visitor mutualistic networks. We sampled plant communities and floral visitors in 12 grassland sites with different levels of urbanization and time since the last fire event. Sites with higher levels of urbanization showed higher values for plant species richness, floral visitor richness, and network asymmetry. All sampled networks were significantly nested (with one exception), asymmetric, and specialized. In addition, all networks presented more modules than expected by chance. The frequency of fire disturbance events increased with the level of urbanization. Since grassland ecosystems depend on disturbances to maintain their structure and diversity, we inferred that the history of fire disturbance was the mechanism behind the relationship between urbanization and our biological descriptors. Our findings highlight the importance of small and isolated grassland remnants as conservation assets within urban areas, and that the disturbance events that such sites are submitted to may in fact be what maintains their diversity on multiple levels.

AB  - Abstract
            The construction of ecological security pattern is one of the important ways to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection, as well as the important contents of ecological civilization construction. How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area. As for the spatial distribution, ecological sources of Fengxian County are mainly located in the central and southwestern areas, which is highly coincident with the main rivers and underground drinking water source area. Moreover, key corridors and main corridors with length of approximately 115.71 km and 26.22 km, respectively, formed ecological corridors of Fengxian County. They are concentrated in the western and southwestern regions of the county which is far away from the built-up areas with strong human disturbance. The results will provide scientific evidence for important ecological land protection and ecological space control at a small scale in underdeveloped and plain counties. In addition, it will enrich the theoretical framework and methodological system of ecological security pattern construction. To some extent, it also makes a reference for improving the regional ecological environment carrying capacities and optimizing the ecological spatial structure in such kinds of underdeveloped small-scale counties.

AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multi-level, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.

AB  - The bird community in urban areas indicates the species-specific adaptability to urban conditions such as the increase in man-made habitats. Urban adapters and urban exploiters, two groups that make up most of the urban birds, were assessed to determine their suitable habitat and explain their distribution, as well as to determine the environmental predictors for the two bird groups assemblages in Depok, one of Jakarta’s satellite cities. We used the point-count method to survey the birds in three habitat types, green spaces, residentials, and roadside, and then we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to analyze the species distribution modeling. We also the predicted habitat distributions for the urban adapters and urban exploiters based on several environmental predictors. Our results suggest that both urban adapters and urban exploiters were abundant in residential areas. Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) and cave swiflets (Collocalia linchi) were the most common species in all three habitat types. On average, canopy cover was most extensive in green spaces followed by residential and roadside areas. Urban exploiters were likely to have a high suitability extent compared to urban adapters. The distributions of both groups were affected by the distance to perennial water, then by land function for the urban adapters, and distance to patches for the urban exploiters. The presence of urban adapters and urban exploiters in residential areas suggests that home gardens supported critical habitats when green spaces were unavailable.

T2  - Conservation Genetics
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are the major causes of biodiversity loss, and, increasingly, habitat is fragmented by urbanization. Yet, the degree to which urbanization creates barriers to animal dispersal remains poorly understood. We used population genetic techniques to determine whether urbanization and/or natural landscape features are dispersal barriers to a butterfly, Atrytonopsis new species 1, throughout its range on coastal sand dunes that are increasingly threatened by development. Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations. Consequently, conservation strategies for Atrytonopsis sp1, and potentially for other mobile insects that use open-structured habitats, should not focus explicitly on habitat corridors through urban areas, but rather should seek to preserve and restore as much habitat as possible across the butterfly’s range.

AB  - Urban landscapes are rapid changing ecosystems with diverse urban forms that impede the movement of or­ ganisms. Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape con­ nectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and objectbased image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has dramatically spurred economic development since the 1980s, especially in China, but has had negative impacts on natural resources since it is an irreversible process. Thus, timely monitoring and quantitative analysis of the changes in land use over time and identification of landscape pattern variation related to growth modes in different periods are essential. This study aimed to inspect spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape pattern responses to land use changes in Xuzhou, China durfing the period of 1985–2015. In this context, we propose a new spectral index, called the Normalized Difference Enhanced Urban Index (NDEUI), which combines Nighttime light from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System with annual maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index to reduce the detection confusion between urban areas and barren land. The NDEUI-assisted random forests algorithm was implemented to obtain the land use/land cover maps of Xuzhou in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively. Four different periods (1985–1995, 1995–2005, 2005–2015, and 1985–2015) were chosen for the change analysis of land use and landscape patterns. The results indicate that the urban area has increased by about 30.65%, 10.54%, 68.77%, and 143.75% during the four periods at the main expense of agricultural land, respectively. The spatial trend maps revealed that continuous transition from other land use types into urban land has occurred in a dual-core development mode throughout the urbanization process. We quantified the patch complexity, aggregation, connectivity, and diversity of the landscape, employing a number of landscape metrics to represent the changes in landscape patterns at both the class and landscape levels. The results show that with respect to the four aspects of landscape patterns, there were considerable differences among the four years, mainly owing to the increasing dominance of urbanized land. Spatiotemporal variation in landscape patterns was examined based on 900 × 900 m sub-grids. Combined with the land use changes and spatiotemporal variations in landscape patterns, urban growth mainly occurred in a leapfrog mode along both sides of the roads during the period of 1985 to 1995, and then shifted into edge-expansion mode during the period of 1995 to 2005, and the edge-expansion and leapfrog modes coexisted in the period from 2005 to 2015. The high value spatiotemporal information generated using remote sensing and geographic information system in this study could assist urban planners and policymakers to better understand urban dynamics and evaluate their spatiotemporal and environmental impacts at the local level to enable sustainable urban planning in the future.

AB  - The Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a new approach for dealing with biodiversity conservation based on maintaining the ecological networks by ensuring the survival of animal and plant species. GBI is considered a new public policy to avoid the loss of biodiversity by preserving landscape connectivity and protecting natural habitats from fragmentation. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Japan, China, Brazil, and Turkey are seeking to integrate this concept into their environmental policies. This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them. This methodological approach and the characterization of the Sousse city GBI map represent the first innovative research applied in Tunisia. This prototype can be a reference for other local or regional spaces, contributing toward realizing a national GBI and promoting sustainable projects.

T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Context
Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators.

Aims
The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban–forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban–forest gradient.

Methods
Using a total of 683 independent field- and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls.

Key results
Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76% of the forest landscape to 21% of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban–forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation.

Conclusions
Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient.

Implications
High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators.

AB  - With urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual’s home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs’ habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal’s sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information.

Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network.

Methods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of  occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis.

Results. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic.

The characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres  dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen.

Scientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined.

Practical importance. Distinguished biocentres of Vinnytsia local ecological network will help preserve the biotic and landscape diversity of the city, maintain ecological balance of the city territory.

AB  - The article focuses on the relevant topic of the development of the ecosystem consisting integral landscape formations of biocentric-network type, which has been done in many countries of Europe since the 1990s. The article emphasizes certain achievements of independent Ukraine regarding the methodological developments of the concept of ecosystem, first of all at the national and regional levels and also the low level of its introduction at the local level. In the process of performing (based on studying foreign and domestic experiences) the scientific study of development and perspectives of the development of local ecosystem of a residential area as a basis for the regional ecosystem in the conditions of Yampil city of Vinnytsia Oblast, we determined its extremely high biotic and landscape diversities, and also the threats of its significant transformation. As an important step to prevent negative influence of agrarian activity of inhabitants of Yampil on the environment with restoration of diversity it is characteristic of, we considered the development of the city`s ecosystem. The scientific substantiations made by applications of tools became the basis for the development of local ecosystem. In the developed scheme “Local ecosystem of Yampil city”, we indicated the structural elements of the ecosystem, their localization, toponyms, made corresponding indications on the map and provided all its elements with descriptions. The key and connective territories of the local ecosystem of Yampil city are compartmentalized based on the adopted criteria of the selection. Their internal structures that we characterized in details allowed us to assess the special roles of the key and connective territories in the preservation of biodiversity, landscape basics of the formation and further development of Yampil city. The territories of the city which were not included in the local elements of the ecosystem are considered restorative and buffer territories within the local and regional ecological networks. The suggested scheme of the local econetwork is basic concerning the implementation of the following stages of the development of the ecosystem by composing schemes at the regional and general national levels and is the main condition for the balanced development of the Transnistria region. We obtained the results so as to preserve and effectively use the biotic and landscape diversities combined with non exhaustive use of natural resources, which is the main goal of contemporary nature use, ecological safety and nature protection. The recommendations were developed for the use of nature-protection and administrative bodies in decision making and any kind (land use, nature protection, ecological, etc) of studies.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Biogeography has traditionally focused on the distribution of species, while community ecology has sought to explain the patterns of community composition. Species interactions networks have rarely been subjected to such analyses, as modeling tools have only recently been developed for interaction networks. Here, we examine beta diversity of ecological networks using pollination networks sampled along an urbanization and agricultural intensification gradient in east Leinster, Ireland. We show, for the first time, that anthropogenic gradients structure interaction networks, and exert greater structuring force than geographical proximity. We further showed that species turnover, especially of plants, is the major driver of interaction turnover, and that this contribution increased with anthropogenic induced environmental dissimilarity, but not spatial distance. Finally, to explore the extent to which it is possible to predict each of the components of interaction turnover, we compared the predictive performance of models that included site characteristics and interaction properties to models that contained species level effects. We show that if we are to accurately predict interaction turnover, data are required on the species-specific responses to environmental gradients. This study highlights the importance of anthropogenic disturbances when considering the biogeography of interaction networks, especially in human dominated landscapes where geographical effects can be secondary sources of variation. Yet, to build a predictive science of the biogeography of interaction networks, further species-specific responses need to be incorporated into interaction distribution modeling approaches.

AB  - Abstract
            Understanding the factors that influence the characteristics of avian communities using urban parks at both the patch and landscape level is important to focus management effort towards enhancing bird diversity. Here, we investigated this issue during the breeding season across urban parks in Beijing, China, using high-resolution satellite imagery. Fifty-two bird species were recorded across 29 parks. Analysis of residence type of birds showed that passengers were the most prevalent (37%), indicating that Beijing is a major node in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. Park size was crucial for total species abundance, but foliage height diversity was the most important factor influencing avian species diversity. Thus, optimizing the configuration of vertical vegetation structure in certain park areas is critical for supporting avian communities in urban parks. Human visitation also showed negative impact on species diversity. At the landscape level, the percentage of artificial surface and largest patch index of woodland in the buffer region significantly affected total species richness, with insectivores and granivores being more sensitive to the landscape pattern of the buffer region. In conclusion, urban birds in Beijing are influenced by various multi-scale factors; however, these effects vary with different feeding types.

AB  - Green roofs are often installed atop buildings to provide ecological services such as mitigating storm water runoff and cooling air within urban heat islands. We found that green roofs in Portland, Oregon, also can support biodiversity, including a diverse assemblage of parasitoid wasps, with 20 morphospecies from 10 families present on the four roofs we surveyed. The roofs with greater plant diversity and structural complexity harbored comparatively more parasitoid morphospecies than the structurally simpler
              Sedum
              -dominated roofs. The oldest green roof supported much greater diversity than the younger roofs, including a comparably planted roof three times its size. Parasitoid wasps from the Hymenopteran families we found are high-trophic-level organisms known to feed on a variety of arthropods, including many insects commonly considered to be pests in urban areas. We suggest that green roofs have the potential to provide an often-overlooked ecological service by supporting parasitoid wasps that can act as natural biological control agents.

TI  - Spatial ecology of an urban eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) population: local decline driven by kangaroo–vehicle collisions
AU  - Brunton, Elizabeth A.

T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Context
As urban landscapes proliferate globally, the need for research into urban wildlife interactions is magnified. The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a widespread species commonly involved in wildlife–vehicle collisions in urban areas in Australia. Despite the many urban kangaroo populations and associated conflicts with human activities, few studies have examined how eastern grey kangaroos interact with, and are affected by, the urban matrix.

Aims
The present study aimed to quantify kangaroo demography, movements, habitat utilisation and exposure to risks during a period of intensive urban development in a rapidly changing suburb located in a region undergoing high urban growth rates.

Methods
We utilised foot-based census surveys, global positioning system (GPS) collars, direct observations and reports of wildlife mortality between 2014 and 2016. Geographical information systems (GIS) were used to integrate GPS-tracking data with spatial layers, to quantify kangaroo movements and habitat utilisation.

Key results
The kangaroo population underwent a steep decline and kangaroo–vehicle collisions were the main source of mortality (73%) during the study period. Kangaroos were regularly exposed to the risk of injury, with roads intersecting many parts of their home range. Kangaroos showed positive habitat selection both for lawn and forest habitats and kangaroo movement and presence at the study site were influenced by high-quality forage and cover.

Conclusions
The present research has highlighted that despite areas of suitable habitat remaining, road-kill was a major contributor to localised kangaroo-population decline. We showed that habitat preferences of eastern grey kangaroos in this urban area were consistent with those in natural landscapes.

Implications
The present study is the first to implicate kangaroo–vehicle collisions as the major factor in population decline in kangaroos. These findings can be utilised to guide design and placement of kangaroo–vehicle collision mitigation and assist in planning of urban areas, particularly where kangaroo populations are in decline. Local extirpation of urban kangaroo populations would be greatly reduced by incorporating site-specific kangaroo habitat preferences and existing patterns of kangaroo habitat use in infrastructure planning. The study has contributed to our understanding of the effects of roads on urban wildlife in general and highlighted the importance of landscape permeability.

AB  - Plecturocebus ornatus is an endemic vulnerable species due to its population decline and its restricted range within the Eastern Plains of Colombia. This region is affected by deforestation as a result of legal and illegal economic activities. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence and abundance of P. ornatus during a period of urban and livestock production expansion (1986-2019) in Villavicencio, Colombia. This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution’s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00–726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species. Therefore, the implementation of restoration measures that increase landscape connectivity and habitat availability is proposed, as well as more control over environmental land-use planning, to contribute to the conservation of P. ornatus in urban areas.

AB  - Abstract
            Populations of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) in southern California occur in one of the most urbanized and fragmented landscapes on the planet and have lost up to 80% of their native habitat. Orange County is one of the last strongholds for this pond-breeding amphibian in the region, and ongoing restoration efforts targeting S. hammondii have involved habitat protection and the construction of artificial breeding ponds. These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought. Management efforts should focus on maintaining gene flow among natural and artificial ponds by both assisted migration and construction of new ponds to bolster the existing pond network in the region.

AB  - The configuration of urban land-covers is essential for improving dwellers’ environments and ecosystem services. A city-level comparison of land-cover changes along the Belt and Road is still unavailable due to the lack of intra-urban land products. A synergistic classification methodology of sub-pixel un-mixing, multiple indices, decision tree classifier, unsupervised (SMDU) classification was established in the study to examine urban land covers across 65 capital cities along the Belt and Road during 2000–2015. The overall accuracies of the 15 m resolution urban products (i.e., the impervious surface area, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were 92.88% and 93.19%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.85 in 2000 and 2015, respectively. The built-up areas of 65 capital cities increased from 23,696.25 km2 to 29,257.51 km2, with an average growth rate of 370.75 km2/y during 2000–2015. Moreover, urban impervious surface area (ISA) expanded with an average rate of 401.92 km2/y, while the total area of urban green space (UGS) decreased with an average rate of 17.59 km2/y. In different regions, UGS changes declined by 7.37% in humid cities but increased by 14.61% in arid cities. According to the landscape ecology indicators, urban land-cover configurations became more integrated (△Shannon’s Diversity Index (SHDI) = −0.063; △Patch Density (PD) = 0.054) and presented better connectivity (△Connectance Index (CON) = +0.594). The proposed method in this study improved the separation between ISA and bare soil in mixed pixels, and the 15 m intra-urban land-cover product provided essential details of complex urban landscapes and urban ecological needs compared with contemporary global products. These findings provide valuable information for urban planners dealing with human comfort and ecosystem service needs in urban areas.

              In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features. Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (
              Apis mellifera
              ) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Revealing patterns of genetic diversity and barriers for gene flow are key points for successful conservation in endangered species. Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on
              mt
              DNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad
              Bombina variegata
              over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts.

AB  - The wildland–urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes—creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O’Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km2 of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human–carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.

AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a ‘renaturing’ strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

AB  - Background
              Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong’an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity.
            
            
              Results
              Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD).
            
            
              Discussion
              
                Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species
                α
                -diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the habitat quality (HQ) in urban areas has been eroded. This phenomenon is destroying the balance of ecosystems, triggering the reduction of biodiversity and the decay of ecosystem service functions. The study of the relationship between urbanization and HQ in Zhengzhou City is beneficial for the reference of sustainable urban ecological planning and management. Based on landscape classification data and socioeconomic data for three years, this study analyzes the spatial correlations between socioeconomic and landscape pattern factors and HQ, compares the dynamic changes in the explanatory power of different factors, and explores the joint effects between multiple factors. The results show that: (1) The overall value of HQ index in Zhengzhou City decreased by .10 during 2000–2020, mainly occurring in suburban areas, with a small amount of HQ improvement occurring in the core areas of ecological protection, such as mountains and river channels. (2) The spatial autocorrelation of all influencing factors with HQ increased during this period, while the negative impact from socio-economic sources was stronger than the positive impact from landscape patterns. (3) Intensive human activities lead to a single habitat type, which reduces HQ; rich landscape types and complex landscape composition can enhance HQ. Improving the connectivity of blue-green landscapes helps to attenuate the negative effects of urbanization on HQ. (4) Changes of HQ in the study area and the development of multi-factor effects on HQ are driven by the Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area Plan. Urban development policies and management can build idyllic complexes at the edge of urban development, preserving pristine blue-green patches to avoid their homogenized distribution and thus slowing the decline of HQ. The above results provide new ideas for the development of sustainable urban ecology.

AB  - Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (
              Erinaceus europaeus
              ) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. ‘Hedgehog Street’ is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers (‘Hedgehog Champions’) to create access points (‘hedgehog highways’) across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1–29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders’ gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately “wildlife-friendly”, and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.

AB  - Abstract   Context  In central Queensland, Australia, the development of a coal-seam gas (CSG) industry is creating additional fragmentation of landscapes consisting of woodland and open forest that are already highly fragmented.   Aims  To assess the response to fragmentation of Strophurus taenicauda (golden-tailed gecko). The species is ‘near threatened’ in Queensland.   Methods  Occurrence and abundance were examined across three categories of patch size – small (≤10 ha), medium (10–100 ha) and large (≥100 ha) – across three geographic areas of the species’ range. Minimal impact (i.e. sighting only) active searches for geckos were conducted at night. A minimum of three replicate sites of each patch size category was surveyed in each of the three geographic areas. Eleven additional patches (each <4 ha and located in the southern geographic area) were surveyed to investigate how size and spatial isolation of small patches affected occurrence and abundance of S. taenicauda. At all sites a standardised set of 22 habitat variables was collected, and the presence of other species of arboreal gecko was recorded.   Key results  The species was located across patches of all sizes, including those as small as 1.11 ha. It was also located opportunistically in the matrix among patches and occurred in isolated trees within an urban area. The abundance of another commonly occurring arboreal gecko, Gehyra dubia (dubious dtella), was negatively correlated with S. taenicauda abundance in small patches. The most important habitat variable for S. taenicauda was average basal area of trees. As this increased, especially above 5.7 m2 ha−1, it was more likely to be present. When considering only the small patches, the main factors influencing presence and abundance of S. taenicauda were the average basal area of Callitris glaucophylla (white cypress) and grazing (negligible or absent).   Conclusions  Strophurus taenicauda is a species that is tolerant of disturbance and can persist in fragmented habitat, provided the fragments have adequate cover of white cypress.   Implications  The species appears to be resilient to the current level of CSG development within its geographic range.

AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.

TI  - Mapping the Flow of Forest Migration through the City under Climate Change
AU  - Han, Qiyao

T2  - Urban Planning
AB  - Rapid climate change will create extreme problems for the biota of the planet. Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on “where tree species should be in the future” and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees.

TI  - Urban open spaces from a dispersal perspective: lessons from an individual-based model approach to assess the effects of landscape patterns on the viability of wildlife populations
AU  - Penteado, Homero Marconi
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Abstract
            
              Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species – Red-legged frog (
              Rana aurora aurora
              ), Western meadowlark (
              Sturnella neclecta
              ) and Douglas squirrel (
              Tamasciurus douglasii
              ) – movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected – like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

AB  - La fragmentación de bosques y la potencial pérdida de calidad de hábitat asociada es una de las principales causas de pérdida de biodiversidad. Una de las estrategias para fomentar el mantenimiento de la misma a nivel de paisaje es el establecimiento de corredores biológicos que faciliten la conectividad estructural y funcional de los elementos bióticos. Sin embargo, la aplicabilidad y funcionalidad de esta herramienta está limitada por la falta de planeación al momento del diseño y establecimiento de corredores o redes de conectividad que obedezcan a métodos detallados y rigurosos. En esta investigación desarrollamos una propuesta teórica de conectividad ecológica para el corregimiento de Santa Elena, municipio de Medellín, Colombia, empleando herramientas de la ecología del paisaje. Inicialmente, se seleccionaron 21 fragmentos de bosque o núcleos a conectar a partir de su tamaño mínimo (mayores a 5 ha), área de interior (mayor a 1 ha) y sus índices de forma (redondeados o casi redondeados). Seguidamente, a partir de la creación de una matriz de fricción al desplazamiento, diseñamos una red potencial que permitiría conectar 1356,35 ha de nodos de bosques remanentes a través de 31 corredores ecológicos de 100 m de ancho con una extensión total de 208,33 ha. Finalmente, discutimos la importancia de fomentar este tipo de herramientas de planeación con herramientas de la ecología del paisaje que promueven la conservación de hábitats y la conectividad del paisaje en áreas cercanas a grandes urbes latinoamericanas.

AB  - We compared the avifauna recorded in a recent survey in an urban park (Parque Municipal Henrique Luís Roessler, Parcão) and surroundings, Novo Hamburgo, RS, with past data, to evaluate the possible alterations in species composition over time. Of the 265 species compiled as original elements of that region, 114 were found at Parcão. Among forest species, 37% were considered locally extinct. The most affected guild was the large frugivores, with nine extinct species and one survivor (Trogon surrucura). Birds highly sensitive to disturbance as well as endemic species were the most extinguished. The possible causes for this loss are fragmentation, hunting and environmental changes. The diversity today is threatened, thus conservation measures are necessary in that region. The most important actions are: maintenance of ecological corridors, protection of natural remnant areas and the establishment of protected areas.

A guilda mais afetada foi a dos frugívoros de grande porte, com nove espécies extintas e uma sobrevivente (Trogon surrucura). Aves endêmicas e com alta sensibilidade à perturbação nos hábitats se extinguiram mais. As prováveis causas dessas perdas são fragmentação, caça e descaracterização dos ambientes. A diversidade atual encontra-se ameaçada e, portanto, medidas de conservação se fazem necessárias na região. As mais importantes são: manutenção de corredores ecológicos, proteção dos remanescentes naturais e criação de unidades de conservação.

TI  - Urban Green Space Pattern in Core Cities of the Greater Bay Area Based on Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis
AU  - Lian, Zixuan

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological systems and improving human well-being in cities. The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou’s UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen–Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai–Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate domestication effects on the genetic structure of two dioecious species
              Brosimum alicastrum
              Sw. (Moraceae) and
              Spondias purpurea

              Cordia dodecandra
              A. DC. (Cordiaceae), growing in remnant forests and homegardens within two climatic regions of the Peninsula of Yucatan. The trees of
              B. alicastrum
              and
              C. dodecandra
              are propagated by seeds in both population types, while those of
              S. purpurea
              are propagated asexually in the homegardens. ISSRs genetic markers were amplified from foliar tissue of 18 to 21 plants per population type/region combination for each species. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure estimators were obtained and compared among species at the regional and population level. We found higher polymorphism (37.5–41), but lower private alleles (4–4.4) and similar heterozygosity (0.1–0.12) in the species with sexual reproduction compared to
              S. purpurea
              (34, 8, and 0.11, respectively). Genetic diversity in
              B. alicastrum
              populations varied with the region; in
              C. dodecandra
              , to the population type; and in
              S. purpurea

              (−0.006 and 0.002) but not for
              B. alicastrum
              (0.1). Gene flow between populations within the regions for the sexually reproducing species was suggested by lower θ

                ST
              
              (0.002–0.12) values were found between the northeastern forest and homegarden populations for the three species, the dendrogram, Bayesian assignment, and K-Means analyses suggest that the least differentiated populations are southwestern forest and homegarden populations of
              B. alicastrum
              and
              S. purpurea
              , and the southwestern forest and northeastern homegarden of
              C. dodecandra
              . The sexual reproduction, biotic interactions, and extensive management of
              B. alicastrum
              and
              C. dodecandra
              in the agroforestry and the urban systems may contribute to connectivity between wild and domesticated populations, while in
              S. purpurea
              this connectivity is interrupted by the clonal propagation of the species in the homegardens.

TI  - Small Urban Green Roof Plots Near Larger Green Spaces May Not Provide Additional Habitat for Birds
AU  - Partridge, Dustin R.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to urbanization. However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.

TI  - Gap-crossing decisions by forest birds: an empirical basis for parameterizing spatially-explicit, individual-based models
AU  - Bélisle, Marc
AU  - Desrochers, André
T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - Spatially-explicit, individual-based models are increasingly used to evaluate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on habitat use and population persistence. Yet, they are criticized on the basis that they rely on little empirical data, especially regarding decision rules of moving individuals. Here we report the results of an experiment measuring the gap-crossing decisions of forest birds attracted to a recording of chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mobbing calls, and provided with options to travel to the speaker by either crossing an open area (short cut) or taking a longer route under forest cover (detour). We performed the experiment in winter and late summer near Québec City, Québec, Canada. We recorded 1078 travel paths from 6 resident and 12 migratory species in 249 experimental sites. In both seasons, birds preferred to travel under forest cover rather than cross open areas, even when the forested detour conveyed a substantially longer route than the short cut in the open. Only when the detour under forest cover. This was considerably longer than the short-cut in the open, in both relative and absolute terms, were birds more likely to take short cuts, indicating that gap-crossing decisions are scale dependent. However, birds rarely ventured > 25 m from forest edges despite having the opportunity to do so. Except for Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) which ventured further into the open, all species showed similar gap-crossing decisions. Residents remained marginally closer to forest edges in late summer as compared to in winter. Conspecific group size had no influence on gap-crossing decisions. This experiment supports the hypothesis that forest bird movements are constrained in fragmented landscapes, and provides opportunities to calibrate spatially-explicit, individual-based models addressing the influence of landscape composition and configuration on dispersal.

AB  - Landscape changes due to urban expansion may severely influence urban biodiversity through direct and indirect effects. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the urban expansion effects on species diversity is essential for conservation biologists, urban planners, and policymakers to help design more practical and effective conservation strategies. Here, based on monthly bird survey data of 12 university campuses distributed in the center and the Xianlin university town of Nanjing city, we first compared the differences of the campuses bird species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices. Then, we analyzed the effects of a variety of landscape attributes on the campuses bird species richness. Unlike other studies, we also constructed a 2 km buffer area surrounding each campus and analyzed the effects of the landscape attributes of the buffer area on species richness. We found that bird species richness was higher in the campus of Xianlin compared to those in the center. Landscape attributes played an important role on bird species richness, especially for the determinants in the buffer area. Specifically, species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices increased with the increasing area of water and green space both within the campus and the buffer area. Not surprisingly, bird species richness and diversity were more affected by fragmentation of the buffer area, increasing with the aggregation index and decreasing with the splitting index. Our study emphasized that landscape attributes of both campuses and buffer areas determined bird species richness and diversity, offering several practical implications for urban biodiversity maintenance and eco-friendly urban planning.

AB  - University campuses are important components of cities, harboring the majority of urban biodiversity. In this study, based on monthly bird survey data covering 12 university campuses located either downtown or in the newly developed areas in Nanjing, China, in 2019, we studied the assembly processes of each campus’s bird population and their main drivers by modeling a set of ecological and landscape determinants. Our results showed that (1) bird abundance and species diversity in the newly developed areas were significantly higher than in those downtown; (2) the phylogeny of bird communities in all universities followed a pattern of aggregation, indicating that environmental filtering played a major role in community assembly; (3) specifically, grass, water, and buildings were the main factors affecting each campus’s bird community’s functional and phylogenetic diversity, with the areas of grass and water habitats having a significant positive correlation with phylogenetic diversity, while the size of building areas was negatively correlated. Our results emphasize that habitat features play a decisive role in determining urban bird population diversity and community assembly processes. We suggest that increasing landscape diversity, e.g., by reasonably arranging the location and area of water bodies and grasslands and improving the landscape connectivity, could be a powerful way to maintain and promote urban bird diversity.

AB  - Abstract
            Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

AB  - Ensuring connectivity in the countryside and cities is a key element of nature protection, allowing genetic fluxes between populations in fragmented ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that artificial green corridors are effective for birds in the city of Cochabamba (Bolivia). We compared the following aspects of natural corridors, with generally preserved vegetation, to those of artificial corridors, constituting parks and gardens in a matrix of streets densely planted with trees: species abundance and richness, functional diversity, and the traits of bird communities. We used canonical redundancy analysis to relate species abundance to the corridor type, noise, tree vegetation structure, richness, and functional diversity. We also tested the explanatory factors for relationships with bird species richness, functional diversity, and traits. We found that most species were shared between the corridor types; the corridor type, nevertheless, had significant effects, with bird species in the green corridors being more common and heavier and having a lower beak depth/mass. By contrast, noise-reflecting urbanization deeply affected all of the studied traits, indicating large shifts in species composition. In conclusion, green corridors seem reliable enough to maintain birds at a level almost comparable to that in linear corridors, but noise is a limiting factor for efficiency for both types.

AB  - Abstract
ContextThe Baudin’s cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology.
AimsTo identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin’s cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data.
MethodsWild Baudin’s cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates.
Key resultsThere was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape.
ConclusionsThe research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin’s cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin’s cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species.
ImplicationsThis research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin’s cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

AB  - Given widespread concerns over human-mediated bee declines in abundance and species richness, conservation efforts are increasingly focused on maintaining natural habitats to support bee diversity in otherwise resource-poor environments. However, natural habitat patches can vary in composition, impacting landscape-level heterogeneity and affecting plant-pollinator interactions. Plant-pollinator networks, especially those based on pollen loads, can provide valuable insight into mutualistic relationships, such as revealing the degree of pollination specialization in a community; yet, local and landscape drivers of these network indices remain understudied within urbanizing landscapes. Beyond networks, analyzing pollen collection can reveal key information about species-level pollen preferences, providing plant restoration information for urban ecosystems. Through bee collection, vegetation surveys, and pollen load identification across ~350 km of urban habitat, we studied the impact of local and landscape-level management on plant-pollinator networks. We also quantified pollinator preferences for plants within urban grasslands. Bees exhibited higher foraging specialization with increasing habitat heterogeneity and visited fewer flowering species (decreased generality) with increasing semi-natural habitat cover. We also found strong pollinator species-specific flower foraging preferences, particularly for Asteraceae plants. We posit that maintaining native forbs and supporting landscape-level natural habitat cover and heterogeneity can provide pollinators with critical food resources across urbanizing ecosystems.

AB  - Abstract
            Setophaga townsendi is a species of wood warbler (family Parulidae) in northwestern North America that has geographic structure in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes: while interior populations have differentiated mitonuclear ancestry from the sister species S. occidentalis, coastal populations have a mix of inland and S. occidentalis mitonuclear ancestries. This coastal to inland transition in genomic ancestry raises the possibility of similar geographic structure in phenotypic traits, especially those involved in mate choice. Using qualitative and multivariate approaches, we investigated whether there is a sharp transition between coastal and inland populations in both song and in nuclear DNA. We find there is a shallow geographic cline in Type I song but not in Type II song. Nuclear DNA shows a gradient between coast and inland. There is little correlation between variation in song and the isolation-by-distance pattern in the nuclear DNA. Learned songbird song is shaped by both genetic and cultural processes. There has been a debate on whether song learning promotes or slows down population differentiation. By comparing the within-species variation in song and genetic structures, we can expand our understanding of the dynamic interplay between mating signals and population differentiation.

AB  - A fragmentação florestal de origem antrópica é um dos resultados do processo desordenado de uso e ocupação do solo, especialmente em paisagens intensamente cultivadas. Neste contexto, o presente trabalho objetivou definir áreas prioritárias, para favorecer a conectividade entre os fragmentos florestais, visando ações de recuperação florestal na Bacia do Rio Pardo, SP, utilizando a abordagem multicriterial denominada Combinação Linear Ponderada.Na definição dos critérios e, posteriormente, dos pesos de fatores, empregou-se a Técnica Participatória. Os fatores considerados importantes ao objetivo do trabalho foram: proximidade entre fragmentos de maior área nuclear, proximidade da cobertura florestal, proximidade da rede hidrográfica, distância aos centros urbanos, declividade, erodibilidade do solo. Considerando que as variáveis que interferem na escolha de áreas prioritárias à restauração florestal na Bacia do Rio Pardo-SP contribuem com pesos diferenciados no processo final de decisão, estabeleceu-se uma hierarquia, de acordo com a importância de cada fator para a aptidão da área. O fator de maior peso foi proximidade entre fragmentos de maior área nuclear (0,3713), seguido de proximidade da cobertura florestal (0,1911), proximidade da rede hidrográfica (0,1516), distância aos centros urbanos (0,1168), declividade (0,0840) e erodibilidade (0,0854).O resultado obtido foi um mapa de áreas prioritárias, com cinco graus de prioridade. A priorização de áreas ocorreu de maneira a promover, primeiro a união dos fragmentos de floresta com maior área nuclear e, a partir dessa união, a sucessiva expansão dessas regiões de prioridade muito alta tendendo a muito baixa. A metodologia mostrou-se adequada ao mapeamento de áreas prioritárias à restauração florestal, em bacias hidrográficas. Uma vez que fragmentos com maiores áreas nucleares sejam conectados com fragmentos pequenos, onde estes são predominantes na paisagem, estes promoverão a formação de fragmentos maiores a partir da formação de corredores florestais e da recomposição da vegetação.

            Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168) , slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

              Background
              Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (
                Ursus arctos
                ) and gray wolf (
                Canis lupus
                ) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada.
              
            
            
              Results
              Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.

AU  - Valeri, Simone

T2  - Land
AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban–rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

AB  - Greenery is a natural value in urban space. To maintain the richness and diversity of greenery, it is necessary to understand the factors and mechanisms that influence vegetation. The purpose of this paper was to determine the impact of selected features of public parks and factors on the richness and diversity of herbaceous plants. In Krakow public parks, this richness and diversity is greater in parks with a larger area and habitat heterogeneity, the presence of migration corridors, and natural elements. Full stand coverage negatively affects diversity. Biologically inactive surface affects richness and diversity as well as a number of different groups of plant species. The presence of rare and non-synanthropic species is related to the park’s surface, natural elements, and its heterogeneity.

AB  - Abstract
            
              During winter, Long-eared Owls
              (Asio otus)
              usually roost in groups in urban areas, but their nocturnal movement patterns are less known. The aim of our study is to provide insight into the local-scale urban movement habits of Long-eared Owls. Our study was carried out between 2015 and 2019 in the autumn and winter period, by observations in the early evening and by ringing and recapture of owls in the town of Sombor (NE Serbia). We observed owls when leaving the roosting site located in the town centre following the greenery of the larger avenues towards the outskirts. Owls were sporadically observed in densely built areas of the town, narrow streets with less greenery. Ringing and recapture data suggest that owls were closely linked to the green corridors. They probably used these corridors for easier orientation and to prey on birds roosting in trees in the town, such as sparrows
              (Passer domesticus, P. montanus)
              , Common Blackbirds
              (Turdus merula)
              or Fieldfares
              (T. pilaris)
              appearing in harsh winters, and sometimes also pigeons.

AB  - Aim
              . To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region.
            
            
              Material and Methods
              . Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS‐3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              . The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.
            
            
              Conclusions
              . The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity of the region.

AB  - Since the 1950s, human activities have been driving economic development and land changes, hindering the conservation of biological habitats and landscape connectivity. Constructing ecological networks is an effective means to avoid habitat destruction and fragmentation. Mountain areas are hotspots of biological habitats and biodiversity; however, the pace of urbanization in mountain areas is also accelerating. To protect an ecosystem more effectively, it is necessary to identify ecological corridors and ecological networks. Therefore, based on the Minimal Cumulative Resistance model and taking Chongqing in China as an example, the identification of potential ecological corridors and the construction of an ecological network in Chongqing were realized using the Linkage Mapper software. The results were as follows: (1) From 2005 to 2015, the patch area of cultivated land and grassland in Chongqing decreased by 0.08% and 1.46%, respectively, while that of built-up areas increased by 1.5%. The fragmentation degree of cultivated land was higher, and the internal connectivity of forestry areas was worse. (2) In total, 24 ecological sources were selected, and 87 potential ecological corridors and 35 ecological nodes were generated using the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis and the Conefor2.6 software. The total length of the ecological network in Chongqing is 2524.34 km, with an average corridor length of 29.02 km. (3) The overall complexity and network efficiency are high, but the spatial distribution of ecological corridors is uneven, especially in the southwest of Chongqing.

AB  - Abstract
            Despite their increasing popularity in an urban setting, we still know relatively little in how well-extensive green roofs support biodiversity in terms of vertical connectivity from terrestrial habitats. Most green roof biodiversity studies have not considered whether the roof height affects community composition and abundance of species present. This study focused on evaluating beetle diversity and abundance in relation to roof height, with emphasis on wildflower roofs. The key results of the study confirm previous studies found that extensive wildflower green roofs are capable of supporting fairly rich beetle communities, including some rare/scarce species. However, an increase of roof height was found to negatively impact both beetle abundance and richness, despite all recorded species being well adapted to active flight and thus dispersal. In addition forb cover decreased with roof height which consequently influenced beetle community structure. These results are therefore indicative that further research is required on species communities found on extensive green roofs that are less adapted to active flight and consequently vertical dispersal. This study further highlights the need for vertical and horizontal connectivity between green roofs and the surrounding natural habitats as a management tool to increase the general ecological value of urban green spaces.

AB  - Manor parks are characteristic objects in the agricultural landscape of Poland. Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species. For all three types of studied objects, characteristic species could be identified. We conclude that adjacent forests allow greater regeneration of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam forest species in manor parks.

AB  - Introductions of non-native lineages increase opportunities for hybridization. Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard,
              Podarcis muralis
              , are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only. Our study shows that cities represent unique settings for hybridization, caused by multiple introductions of non-native taxa. Cityscape structure and invasion histories of cities will determine future evolutionary pathways at these novel hybrid zones.

AB  - Urban open spaces are considered as spatial residuals of the expansion of built areas. The environmental impact of the resulting land-cover pattern and associated ecosystem services are frequently evaluated at a crude spatial resolution only. However, wild animals use remaining interconnected fine-grain open spaces as an infrastructure for movement.
            In this paper, we traced the evolution of an open-space system in Haifa, Israel, and examined the impact of urban morphology on size and distribution of open spaces at different spatial resolutions.
            At a 30 m resolution, our analysis indicated fragmentation and increasing partial elimination of open spaces. Over time the connectivity declined at a diminishing rate, yet the network did not disintegrate into separate components. The evolution analysis implied that in crude resolution, the open space network is threatened.
            At a 5 m resolution, our analysis showed that Haifa remains porous to animal movement. Using combined multiple least-cost paths through the urban landscape of heterogeneous permeability, we illustrated extensive connectivity among open spaces. Backyards and other urban in-between spaces complemented the seminatural open-space network connectivity, enabling wildlife movement between habitat patches and thus survival in an urbanized environment.

AB  - How urbanization shapes population genomic diversity and evolution of urban wildlife is largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of urbanization on white-footed mice,
              Peromyscus leucopus,
              in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area using coalescent-based simulations to infer demographic history from the site-frequency spectrum. We assigned individuals to evolutionary clusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes and migration using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modelling indicates that post-glacial sea-level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently isolated
              P. leucopus
              populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in NYC.

AB  - ABSTRACT
            Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important mutualists for the growth and health of most boreal trees. Forest age and its host species composition can impact the composition of ECM fungal communities. Although plentiful empirical data exist for forested environments, the effects of established vegetation and its successional trajectories on ECM fungi in urban greenspaces remain poorly understood. We analyzed ECM fungi in 5 control forests and 41 urban parks of two plant functional groups (conifer and broadleaf trees) and in three age categories (10, ∼50, and >100 years old) in southern Finland. Our results show that although ECM fungal richness was marginally greater in forests than in urban parks, urban parks still hosted rich and diverse ECM fungal communities. ECM fungal community composition differed between the two habitats but was driven by taxon rank order reordering, as key ECM fungal taxa remained largely the same. In parks, the ECM communities differed between conifer and broadleaf trees. The successional trajectories of ECM fungi, as inferred in relation to the time since park construction, differed among the conifers and broadleaf trees: the ECM fungal communities changed over time under the conifers, whereas communities under broadleaf trees provided no evidence for such age-related effects. Our data show that plant-ECM fungus interactions in urban parks, in spite of being constructed environments, are surprisingly similar in richness to those in natural forests. This suggests that the presence of host trees, rather than soil characteristics or even disturbance regime of the system, determine ECM fungal community structure and diversity.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              In urban environments, soil and trees improve environmental quality and provide essential ecosystem services. ECM fungi enhance plant growth and performance, increasing plant nutrient acquisition and protecting plants against toxic compounds. Recent evidence indicates that soil-inhabiting fungal communities, including ECM and saprotrophic fungi, in urban parks are affected by plant functional type and park age. However, ECM fungal diversity and its responses to urban stress, plant functional type, or park age remain unknown. The significance of our study is in identifying, in greater detail, the responses of ECM fungi in the rhizospheres of conifer and broadleaf trees in urban parks. This will greatly enhance our knowledge of ECM fungal communities under urban stresses, and the findings can be utilized by urban planners to improve urban ecosystem services.

TI  - Effects of within-patch heterogeneity on connectivity in pond-breeding amphibians studied by means of an individual-based model
AU  - Pontoppidan, M.-B.

T2  - Web Ecology
AB  - Abstract. The metapopulation framework presumes the habitat of a local population to be continuous and homogenous, and patch area is often used as a proxy for population size. Many populations of pond-breeding amphibians are assumed to follow metapopulation dynamics, and connectivity is mostly measured between breeding ponds. However, the habitat of pond-breeding amphibians is not only defined by the pond but, typically, consists of a breeding pond surrounded by clusters of disjoint summer-habitat patches interspersed with an agricultural/semi-urban matrix. We hypothesise that the internal structure of a habitat patch may change connectivity in two ways: (i) by affecting animal movements and thereby emigration and immigration probabilities; and (ii) by affecting habitat quality and population size. To test our hypotheses, we apply a spatially explicit individual-based model of Moor frog dispersal. We find that the realised connectivity depends on internal structure of both the target and the source patch as well as on how habitat quality is affected by patch structure. Although fragmentation is generally thought to have negative effects on connectivity, our results suggest that, depending on patch structure and habitat quality, positive effects on connectivity may occur.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is highly anthropized, this reduce the areas of native vegetation and impacts the biodiversity of the biome. The objective of this study is to analyze forest remnants with native vegetation characteristics using a free GIS. This analysis takes place using landscape metrics and was based on the supervised vectorization of land use in the municipality of California, PR. The area of the vectored polygons was obtained and a classified, and then the calculation was made with the nearest neighbor index, mean distance observed, Patton diversity index and the perimeter/area ratio of forest fragments. The results show that most of the fragments have an area smaller than 1 ha, the fragments with more significant area (<50 ha) represent more than 16% of the native vegetation area. The small fragments are important to maintain the connectivity, since the withdrawal of these increases the mean distance observed and nearest neighbor index. Most of the fragments are elongated and amorphous in accordance with the perimeter/area ratio and the Patton diversity index respectively, this may demonstrate the fragments may be subject to edge effects. Even with these characteristics, these fragments may be part of what is planned in public policy for preservation in the Atlantic Forest in the state of Paraná. Therefore, even small fragments with little core area are important for maintaining biodiversity, especially in a highly anthropogenic landscape

AB  - Under the background of rapid urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is becoming increasingly significant. It is very important for the sustainable development of cities to carry out quantitative research on the mitigation of the UHI effect at an urban scale. Taking Shenzhen as an example, this paper puts forward a method for building a cooling corridor for the city with multiscenarios based on the theory of ecological security pattern (ESP), which can realize quantitative planning of the spatial layout of urban green infrastructure (UGI) to alleviate the UHI effect. In this study, cooling sources are identified from the three dimensions of habitat quality, landscape connectivity, and the capacity to provide cooling ecosystem services. The cooling corridors that are superior at cooling, isolation, and ventilation are selected and optimized. The results show that the identified ecological cooling source area accounts for 33.18% of the total area of Shenzhen, and more than 85% of the area falls within the scope of the basic ecological control line of Shenzhen. There are 48 cooling corridors with a total length of 289.17 km in the cooling priority scenario, which mostly pass through the high-temperature and subhigh-temperature areas of each administrative region and city, providing a good cooling effect but poor feasibility. There are 48 corridors with a total length of 326.66 km in the isolation priority scenario, which mostly pass through the administrative region boundary and have a weak connection with the urban heat island, avoiding the built-up areas with strong human activities. As consequence, cooling is relatively achievable, but its effect is not ideal. There are 47 corridors with a total length of 368.06 km in the ventilation priority scenario, including many urban main roads and river systems that fully utilize the area’s strong natural wind conditions and realize various functions; however, the cooling effect is suboptimal. Corridors with great potential in cooling, isolation, ventilation, and noise reduction were determined after comprehensive optimization.

AB  - Urban forests can provide the necessary ecosystem services for their residents and play an important part in improving the urban environment. Forest landscape connectivity is a vital indicator reflecting the quality of the ecological environment and ecological functions. Detecting changes in landscape connectivity is, therefore, an important step for providing sound scientific evidence for the better urban planning. Using remote sensing images of a study area in Zhuhai City in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013, the dynamic forest landscape connectivity of Zhuhai city can be evaluated based on a graph-theoretic approach. The aims of our study were to discover and interpret the effect of rapid urbanization on forest landscape connectivity. The construction of ecological corridors helps us specifically compare the landscape connectivity of three parts of urban forests. On the basis of functional landscape metrics, the correlation of these metrics and patch area was discussed in order to comprehensively identify the key patches. The analysis showed that the total areas of forestlands reduced from 1999 to 2009 and then increased from 2009 to 2013, and the same trend was found in overall forest landscape connectivity. To improve the overall landscape connectivity, construct urban ecological network and appropriately protect biodiversity in the future, the existing important patches with large areas or key positions should be well protected. This study revealed that urbanization reduced the area of key patches and consequently reduced the forest landscape connectivity, which increased while the patch areas increased due to the environmental protection policy. Functional connectivity indicators could provide more comprehensive information in the development of environmental protection strategies.

AB  - Abstract
            A greater understanding of how environmental factors and anthropogenic landscape features influence animal movements can inform management and potentially aid in mitigating human–wildlife conflicts. We investigated the movement patterns of 16 Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus; 6 females, 10 males) in north-central Florida at multiple temporal scales using GPS data collected from 2011 to 2014. We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads. Our findings regarding the influence of landscape and habitat features on movement patterns of Florida black bears could be useful for planning effective wildlife corridors and understanding how future residential or commercial development and road expansions may affect animal movement.

AB  - Preliminary research conducted in Warsaw in the 1970s and 2000s showed that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) stayed in forest habitat and avoided anthropogenic areas. Activity and exploration patterns of animals are shaped by indices of anthropogenic disturbances, elevated in large cities. The aims of the study were (1) to compare the presence of roe deer in natural and anthropogenic habitats of Warsaw during three periods: 1976–1978, 2005–2008 and 2017–2021, based on snow tracking on transect routes (681.2 km in total), and (2) to describe the presence and activity of roe deer in relation to human disturbances in selected urban forests in its reproductive period (March–August), based on camera trap survey (2019–2020, 859 observations, 5317 trap-days in total). The number of tracks was higher in natural habitat during all three periods, with the highest value in 2017–2021 (9.85/km/24h). The peak of roe deer activity was recorded at dusk, and it changed with moon phases between spring and summer. Landscape connectivity and level of light pollution did not affect the activity pattern of roe deer. Our research showed that roe deer inhabiting urban areas avoided human presence by using well-covered habitats and being active in periods when the level of human disturbance was lower.

AB  - Abstract
            Connectivity of social-ecological systems promotes resilience across urban landscapes. Community gardens are social-ecological systems that support food production, social interactions, and biodiversity conservation. We investigate how these hubs of ecosystem services facilitate socio-ecological connectivity and service flows as a network across complex urban landscapes. In three US cities (Baltimore, Chicago, New York City), we use community garden networks as a model system to demonstrate how biophysical and social features of urban landscapes control the pattern and magnitude of ecosystem service flows through these systems. We show that community gardens within a city are connected through biological and social mechanisms, and connectivity levels and spatial arrangement differ across cities. We found that biophysical connectivity was higher than social connectivity in one case study, while they were nearly equal in the other two. This higher social connectivity can be attributed to clustered distributions of gardens within neighborhoods (network modularity), which promotes neighborhood-scale connectivity hotspots, but produces landscape-scale connectivity coldspots. The particular patterns illustrate how urban form and social amenities largely shape ecosystem service flows among garden networks. Such socio-ecological analyses can be applied to enhance and stabilize landscape connectedness to improve life and resilience in cities.

AB  - Urbanization can have profound consequences for mammalian biodiversity and is thought to contribute to patterns of species richness and community composition. Large cities can be particularly challenging environments for mammals because these habitats are often impacted by anthropogenic perturbations, including high human population density, fragmented habitats, and extensive human development. In this study, we investigated mammalian species richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity, and evenness in the most densely populated region in the United States: the New York metropolitan area. Specifically, we deployed camera traps from 2015 to 2019 to investigate six drivers of mammalian diversity across 31 greenspaces: (1) human population density, (2) patch size, (3) habitat type, (4) surrounding land cover, (5) geographical barriers to dispersal, and (6) habitat heterogeneity. We found that mammal community composition is largely influenced by a multitude of anthropogenic factors. Specifically, mammal species richness was higher in greenspaces with larger patch sizes and lower in greenspaces surrounded by more development. Moreover, Shannon–Wiener diversity and evenness were higher in urban natural landscapes than human-altered landscapes. In a subset of data that only included carnivores, we found that carnivore Shannon–Wiener diversity was higher in urban natural habitats and in sites with lower human population densities. Finally, we found that geographical barriers to dispersal contributed to both patterns of mammalian diversity and patterns of carnivore diversity: mammal taxa richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity, and evenness were all significantly higher on the continent (Bronx/Westchester) than on Long Island. These results suggest that preserving urban greenspaces is important for maintaining both mammalian and carnivore biodiversity and that management of mammals in cities should concentrate on maintaining large, connected, natural greenspaces.

AB  - Abstract
            Bird species richness has often been used as an indicator of urbanisation effects on biodiversity in North America and Europe, but similar studies are rare in rapidly urbanising regions in the tropics. Here we assess the effect of different urban environmental factors on local resident bird species richness at different spatial extents in South Asian cities. Bird data at 57 urban locations distributed across 11 cities were retrieved from the available literature. Different variables assessing the degree of urbanisation and urban habitat factors were measured, at 1000 m and 5000 m radius scale extent, for each urban location. We investigated how resident bird species richness was affected by urban environmental predictors by fitting linear regression models in a Bayesian framework. Our model suggested strong positive influence of the interaction between habitat Shannon metric (a proxy of habitat heterogeneity) and proportion of impervious surface (a proxy of human built-up and settlement extent) on local resident bird richness at both spatial scales. Increasing values of habitat Shannon metric positively related to increasing bird richness, but only when the proportion of impervious surface was very high. Our results suggest that areas with a high degree of urbanisation necessitate an increase of habitat heterogeneity to maintain high local bird diversity. Increasing the quality and the compositional variability of remaining bird habitat patches in highly built-up areas should be a major conservation concern within cities of South Asia.

AB  - Abstract
            Good knowledge on how increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is essential in order to preserve biodiversity in urban green spaces. We examined how urban development affects species richness and total abundance of butterflies as well as the occurrence and abundance of individual species within the Helsinki metropolitan area in Northern Europe. Repeated butterfly counts in 167 separate 1-km-long transects within Helsinki covered the entire urbanization gradient, quantified by human population density and the proportion of built-up area (within a 50-m buffer surrounding each butterfly transect). We found consistently negative effects of both human population density and built-up area on all studied butterfly variables, though butterflies responded markedly more negatively to increasing human population density than to built-up area. Responses in butterfly species richness and total abundance showed higher variability in relation to proportion of built-up area than to human density, especially in areas of high human density. Increasing human density negatively affected both the abundance and the occurrence of 47% of the 19 most abundant species, whereas, for the proportion of built-up area, the corresponding percentages were 32% and 32%, respectively. Species with high habitat specificity and low mobility showed higher sensitivity to urbanization (especially high human population density) than habitat generalists and mobile species that dominated the urban butterfly communities. Our results suggest that human population density provides a better indicator of urbanization effects on butterflies compared to the proportion of built-up area. The generality of this finding should be verified in other contexts and taxonomic groups.

AB  - Urbanization constitutes one of the most aggressive drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss worldwide. However, studies focused on determining the response of local biodiversity to urbanization are still scarce, especially in tropical ecosystems. Urban ecosystems are characterized by low biological productivity which in turn leads to a reduction in biodiversity. However, the responses to urbanization should be species dependent. For instance, changes in the availability of resources can favor certain species with specific characteristics. We assessed the effects of the urbanization process on a bird community in a city located in the Tropical Andes of southern Ecuador, a region widely recognized for its diversity and endemism of birds. We selected three independent localities in each of the four levels of the urbanization gradient in the study area (forest, forest-pasture, pasture, and urban). In each locality, we sampled the bird community by visual and auditory surveys along 1 km transects between 2016 and 2017. We recorded a total of 1,257 individuals belonging to 74 bird species. We evaluated if the responses of richness and abundance of birds are dependent on trophic guild and foraging strata. We found a significant decrease in bird species richness and abundance from forest to urban sites. However, the response of birds was dependent on the trophic guild and foraging strata. Granivorous birds showed a positive response associated with the urbanization gradient while insectivorous birds showed a negative response. Insectivorous birds were more abundant in forest sites and decreased in abundance across the urbanization gradient. We found that the proportion of birds using different foraging strata drastically changed along urban gradient. Forest sites exhibited a bird community using a variety of habitats, but the bird community became simpler toward the most urbanized sites. Our findings showed different effects of urbanization on bird communities. The ugly: urbanization leads to a dramatic reduction in the diversity of birds, which is consistent in cities with different characteristics and ecological contexts. On the other hand, the responses of bird guilds to urbanization are species dependent. Some guilds are positively impacted by urbanization and show increases in species richness and abundance while other guilds are negatively impacted.

AB  - Urbanization is an increasingly pervasive form of land transformation that reduces biodiversity of many taxonomic groups. Beetles exhibit a broad range of responses to urbanization, likely due to the high functional diversity in this order. Carrion beetles (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Silphidae) provide an important ecosystem service by promoting decomposition of small-bodied carcasses, and have previously been found to decline due to forest fragmentation caused by urbanization. However, New York City (NYC) and many other cities have fairly large continuous forest patches that support dense populations of small mammals, and thus may harbor relatively robust carrion beetle communities in city parks. In this study, we investigated carrion beetle community composition, abundance and diversity in forest patches along an urban-to-rural gradient spanning the urban core (Central Park, NYC) to outlying rural areas. We conducted an additional study comparing the current carrion beetle community at a single suburban site in Westchester County, NY that was intensively surveyed in the early 1970’s. We collected a total of 2,170 carrion beetles from eight species at 13 sites along this gradient. We report little to no effect of urbanization on carrion beetle diversity, although two species were not detected in any urban parks.
              Nicrophorus tomentosus
              was the most abundant species at all sites and seemed to dominate the urban communities, potentially due to its generalist habits and shallower burying depth compared to the other beetles surveyed. Variation between species body size, habitat specialization, and % forest area surrounding the surveyed sites also did not influence carrion beetle communities. Lastly, we found few significant differences in relative abundance of 10 different carrion beetle species between 1974 and 2015 at a single site in Westchester County, NY, although two of the rare species in the early 1970’s were not detected in 2015. These results indicate that NYC’s forested parks have the potential to sustain carrion beetle communities and the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Abstract
            
              In 2016, we studied the occurrence of amphibians in 231 selected ponds in the city of Wrocław (Lower Silesia, Poland) and confirmed the occurrence of 10 species:
              Bombina bombina, Bufo bufo, Bufotes viridis, Hyla arborea, Pelobates fuscus, Pelophylax esculentus
              complex,
              Rana arvalis
              ,
              Rana temporaria, Lissotriton vulgaris
              and
              Triturus cristatus
              . Among all studied sites, the most common were
              P. esculentus
              complex (146 occupied sites, 63.2%) and
              B. bufo
              (119, 51.5%), while the rarest was
              P. fuscus
              (8, 3.5%). The number of species at a single site varied from 0 (28 sites, 12.1%) to 9 (1 site, 0.4%). Frequency and mean amphibian species richness reached 87.9% and 2.7 ± 1.9, respectively. The composition of amphibian species did not change in comparison to previous studies conducted in the years 1997–2009, but declining trends in five species (
              B. bombina
              ,
              B. viridis
              ,
              H. arborea
              ,
              P. esculentus
              complex,
              P. fuscus
              ) were observed (28 compared sites). The results revealed that the permanency of ponds, their occurrence in the vicinity of river valleys, and a high ratio of watercourse length and green area around ponds are positively correlated and have a significant influence on amphibian species richness within the city. Thus, these identified factors should be considered in the course of sustainable urban planning in order to avoid potential conflicts between nature conservation and urban development.

AB  - Contrasting trajectories of biodiversity loss and urban expansion make it imperative to understand biodiversity persistence in cities. Size-, local-, and landscape-level habitat factors of greenspaces in cities may be critical for future design and management of urban greenspaces in conserving bird biodiversity. Most current understanding of bird communities in cities has come from disparate analyses of single cities, over relatively short time periods, producing limited understanding of processes and characteristics of bird patterns for improved biodiversity management of the world’s cities. We analyzed bird biodiversity in 112 urban greenspaces from 51 cities across eight countries, using eBird, a broadscale citizen science project. Species richness and Shannon diversity were used as response variables, while percent tree cover, percent water cover, and vegetation index were used as habitat predictor variables at both a landscape (5 and 25 km radius) and local-scale level (speciﬁc to an individual greenspace) in the modeling process, retrieved using Google Earth Engine. Area of a greenspace was the most important predictor of bird biodiversity, underlining the critical importance of habitat area as the most important factor for increasing bird biodiversity and mitigating loss from urbanization. Surprisingly, distance from the city center and distance from the coast were not signiﬁcantly related to bird biodiversity. Landscape-scale habitat predictors were less related to bird biodiversity than local-scale habitat predictors. Ultimately, bird biodiversity loss could be mitigated by protecting and developing large greenspaces with varied habitat in the world’s cities.

TI  - Moth assemblages within urban domestic gardens respond positively to habitat complexity, but only at a scale that extends beyond the garden boundary
AU  - Ellis, Emilie E.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Abstract
            ‘Wildlife-friendly’ gardening is a dominant theme in the media that readily engages public attention. However, there is little empirical evidence of the ecological benefits of increased habitat quality of individual domestic gardens. This study uses light-trapping to examine the response of moth assemblages to domestic gardens that are assessed in terms of their habitat complexity (simple and complex) both within the garden and extending out to a 30 m radius that includes surrounding habitats. The results clearly show that moth assemblages were influenced by complex habitats (particularly increasing levels of the variable shrubs and decreasing levels of artificial surfaces), but only at a scale that extended beyond the garden boundary to include the surrounding area. In other words, neither the complexity of the habitat within the garden or the size of the garden had any influence on the abundance or diversity of the moth assemblage. These results have implications for both garden management and landscape planning – if domestic gardens are to be a useful component of strategies to reduce biodiversity loss within the urban environment then they should provide good habitat quality and be managed as a network of interconnected patches rather than as individual units.

AB  - Abstract
            In an increasingly urbanized world, there is a need to study urban areas as their own class of ecosystems as well as assess the impacts of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. However, collecting a sufficient number of species observations to estimate patterns of biodiversity in a city can be costly. Here we investigated the use of community science-based data on species occurrences, combined with species distribution models (SDMs), built using MaxEnt and remotely-sensed measures of the environment, to predict the distribution of a number of species across the urban environment of Los Angeles. By selecting species with the most accurate SDMs, and then summarizing these by class, we were able to produce two species richness models (SRMs) to predict biodiversity patterns for species in the class Aves and Magnoliopsida and how they respond to a variety of natural and anthropogenic environmental gradients.
            We found that species considered native to Los Angeles tend to have significantly more accurate SDMs than their non-native counterparts. For all species considered in this study we found environmental variables describing anthropogenic activities, such as housing density and alterations to land cover, tend to be more influential than natural factors, such as terrain and proximity to freshwater, in shaping SDMs. Using a random forest model we found our SRMs could account for approximately 54% and 62% of the predicted variation in species richness for species in the classes Aves and Magnoliopsida respectively. Using community science-based species occurrences, SRMs can be used to model patterns of urban biodiversity and assess the roles of environmental factors in shaping them.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) are important elements of urban landscapes. Woody vegetation is a key component of UGSs, providing many socio-ecological benefits such as habitat provision and human well-being. Knowing plant diversity and vegetation configuration that underpin urban ecosystem processes and functions is critical to maximize nature contributions to city dwellers. Here, we present a well-replicated multi-city study showing a detailed description of taxonomic and structural diversity of woody vegetation in 225 UGSs distributed across seven European cities along a NE-SW gradient. Our aim was to understand how UGSs attributes, including size and fragmentation, influence woody vegetation features. A total of 418 woody species belonging to 76 families were identified. UGS size displayed weak positive correlations with woody species richness, but a strong negative correlation with woody species density. Alien woody species were abundant in all cities (from 40% of all species recorded in Antwerp to 64% in Lisbon and Zurich). Among the native tree species we found a predominance of Pinus spp. in southern cities and Acer spp. in cooler climates. On average, tree canopies extent was 56% of UGSs. This paper provides insights on the plant diversity and woody vegetation composition in UGSs of different size, climate and urban planning history. Our results encourage and contribute to future urban ecology studies involving different taxa and ecosystem services as well as support effective urban planning and management practices.

AB  - With the expansion of urban areas, promoting urban biodiversity is now a priority. Many municipalities are implementing greening strategies to improve and increase green space within city boundaries. The effectiveness of these strategies, while rarely assessed, likely depends on the landscape and on relevant species intrinsic traits such as dispersal ability. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we evaluated the effect of the urban landscape on the projected distribution of three butterfly species with contrasting dispersal abilities, and assessed the effectiveness of the Barcelona greening strategy as a case study. Species distribution (in terms of patch occupancy) and effectiveness (in terms of population size and number of occupied gardens) were analysed using generalised linear models. The percentage of (semi) natural source area around each urban green space (garden hereafter) was the most important variable for the distribution of all three types of species, followed by the percentage of neighbouring gardens and by the garden carrying capacity, although the effect of neighbouring gardens was negative in the early phase of colonisation. The planned Barcelona greening strategy increased the number of gardens occupied by high and medium, but not by low dispersive species. Increasing the carrying capacity of the gardens improved colonisation for all three species types. While the best strategies can be context dependent, our results indicated that increasing garden area might be more effective in the long term but it can be overridden by garden capacity in the short term, especially if there are constraints to increasing garden area.

AB  - Biodiversity is challenged worldwide by exploitation, global warming, changes in land use and increasing urbanization. It is hypothesized that communities in urban areas should consist primarily of generalist species with broad niches that are able to cope with novel, variable, fragmented, warmer and unpredictable environments shaped by human pressures. We surveyed moth communities in three cities in northern Europe and compared them with neighbouring moth assemblages constituting species pools of potential colonizers. We found that urban moth communities consisted of multi-dimensional generalist species that had larger distribution ranges, more variable colour patterns, longer reproductive seasons, broader diets, were more likely to overwinter as an egg, more thermophilic, and occupied more habitat types compared with moth communities in surrounding areas. When body size was analysed separately, results indicated that city occupancy was associated with larger size, but this effect disappeared when body size was analysed together with the other traits. Our findings indicate that urbanization imposes a spatial filtering process in favour of thermophilic species characterized by high intraspecific diversity and multi-dimensional generalist lifestyles over specialized species with narrow niches.

T2  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Urban expansion often accompanies a loss of natural habitats and arable lands but an increase in urban population. In China, vegetable-dominant small farmlands are common in urban/peri-urban areas. Some farmlands are also associated with government policy that aims to enhance local farmers’ livelihoods as well as increase food availability for city citizens. While small urban farmlands create open greenery cover that may provide birds with resources such as food and shelter, little attention has been given to understanding bird diversity in urban farmlands. Using two hierarchical models (multi-species occupancy model and N-mixture model), we examined how species richness and abundance of birds were associated with environmental characteristics within and surrounding urban farmlands in Guangzhou, one of the largest cities in China. We conducted crop and bird surveys at urban farmlands during two winter seasons between December 2019 and January 2021. Species richness increased with non-woody (herbaceous) vegetation cover within a farmland. Abundance of three species was also positively associated with the local non-woody vegetation variable. Two species were more abundant at farmlands with higher crop diversity. Compositional features of matrix surrounding a farmland (a 500-m circular area) did not affect species richness. However, species richness and abundance of one species tended to decrease with increasing farmland fragmentation (patch density of farmlands) within a 1-km circular area. These findings suggest that (1) birds could be more influenced by environmental features within farmlands than matrix features surrounding farmlands, (2) local uncultivated herbaceous vegetation is an important environmental feature, and (3) diverse crops in farmlands may benefit some birds. They also indicate that the landscape pattern of farmlands, such as degree of fragmentation, could affect bird diversity in urban farmlands.

AB  - Animal biodiversity in cities is generally expected to be uniformly reduced, but recent studies show that this is modulated by the composition and conﬁguration of Urban Green Areas (UGAs). UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a signiﬁcant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and ﬂying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identiﬁed artiﬁcial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably ﬁltering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the speciﬁc spatial topology of UGAs in each city.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Urbanization causes environment changes that directly affect biotic diversity, and understanding the relationship between fauna and urban features is a key aspect of urban planning. Birds are particularly affected by urbanization. Noise levels, for instance, negatively affect birds’ behavior and social communication, while the presence of green areas promotes bird diversity. The effects of urbanization could differ according with the level of urbanization, and our goal was to understand how bird species assemblages are related to urban features in an intermediate stage of urbanization (a city in Brazil with 2,470 inhabitants/km²). We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and generalized linear models (GLM) analyses to assess how bird species assemblages are affected by urban features (e.g., noise level, abundance of buildings) as well as habitat features (e.g., vegetation cover). Despite we did not find a clear pattern of urbanization both the urban and habitat features had, even if weak, an effect on bird species distribution. Bird species distribution was spatially correlated, and we identified three groups: 1) grassland and wetland species; 2) forest species; 3) species tolerant to habitat degradation. Species richness was positively related to the proportion of trees, abundance of people and presence of buildings, and negatively affected by higher levels of noise. The abundance of species decreased as noise levels increased, but the proportion of green areas (open or forest vegetation) had a positive effect. Agreeing with previous research, our study shows that noise levels and vegetation cover seem to be the best predictors of diversity in urban areas. Nevertheless, the presence of particular habitats (wetlands, grasslands, woodlots), patchily distributed in the urban matrix, could buffer the effects of urbanization on birds. These habitats should thus be taken into account in urban planning.

            RESUMO: A urbanização resulta em alterações no ambiente que afetam diretamente a diversidade biótica, sendo fundamental a compreensão das relações entre a fauna e as características do ambiente urbano para o planejamento de uma cidade. O ruído, por exemplo, é uma característica do ambiente urbano que afeta negativamente o comportamento e comunicação social das aves, enquanto a presença de áreas verdes promove a diversidade. Os efeitos da urbanização sobre a fauna podem variar conforme o estágio de desenvolvimento urbano, assim, nosso objetivo foi analisar a distribuição da avifauna em uma área com estágio intermediário de urbanização (uma cidade brasileira com 2.470 habitantes/km²) e sua relação com a paisagem urbana. Nós realizamos uma análise de Correspondência Canônica (CCA) e Modelos Lineares Generalizados (GLM) para avaliar como a avifauna é afetada pelos componentes da paisagem urbana (e.g., nível de ruído, número de construções, cobertura vegetal). Apesar de não termos encontrado um padrão claro de urbanização, tanto as características urbanas quanto as de habitat tiveram, mesmo que de forma branda, um efeito sobre a distribuição de espécies de aves. A distribuição das espécies foi espacialmente correlacionada, formando três grandes grupos: 1) espécies associadas aos ambientes campestres e úmidos; 2) espécies florestais; 3) espécies tolerantes aos ambientes degradados. A riqueza de espécies foi positivamente relacionada à proporção de árvores, à abundância de pessoas e à presença de prédios, porém teve efeito negativo com o aumento do nível de ruído. Áreas com maior nível de ruído apresentaram menor abundância de aves, enquanto as maiores abundâncias estiveram positivamente associadas à proporção de áreas verdes (vegetação campestre ou florestal). Nossos resultados concordam com estudos prévios que sugerem que o nível de ruído e a cobertura vegetal são as variáveis mais relevantes relacionadas à diversidade de aves em áreas urbanas. Contudo, a presença de habitat específicos (banhados, campos, matas), imersos na matriz urbana, poderiam amortizar os efeitos da urbanização sobre as aves, e estes deveriam ser considerados quando avaliado o planejamento urbano das cidades.

AB  - Abstract
            In cities, woody vegetation provides critical shelter, nesting and foraging habitat for bird species of interest. Human actions—including development and landscaping choices—determine vegetation community composition and structure, making these choices critically important to urban bird conservation. A better understanding of how bird communities are impacted by parcel-scale actions can help guide policy and management best practices to improve matrix habitat quality and quantity. Here, I examined how bird habitat use varies along a vegetation gradient created by different development and landscaping choices. I surveyed 20 commercial office developments near Seattle in the Puget Trough region of Washington, USA selected using stratified random sampling, where I quantified bird communities and observed feeding behavior. I used GLMM and PERMANOVA models with data likelihood metrics to identify the best supported variables for bird site use, along with TITAN models to identify changes in community composition along environmental gradients. I found that measures of bird effective species richness and bird community are positively influenced by the presence of more native conifers, including the presence of a stand predating development and the height and density of native conifers. Measures of the native bird community are negatively influenced by higher non-native tree density. In contrast to prior research, top-down landscape-scale variables did not explain variation in measures of the bird community on office developments. Importantly, I found that birds are associated with the same habitat on office developments as observed elsewhere. Together, my findings suggest an important role for developers, land owners, landscape architects, and tree protection policy in bird conservation.

AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Context
              Many large carnivores depend on habitat patches outside protected areas, as well as safe corridors between them. However, corridor assessments typically ignore potential conflicts between carnivores and people, which can undermine corridor effectiveness and thus conservation success.
            
            
              Objectives
              
                We identified safe dispersal corridors and conflict-prone movement bottlenecks for Persian leopard (
                Panthera pardus saxicolor
                ) between protected areas in the Alborz Mountains, Iran, by mapping habitat, landscape permeability, and conflict risk. We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats.
              
            
            
              Methods
              We mapped land cover using Landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 × 6 km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models.
            
            
              Results
              Leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Human-carnivore conflicts are an important constraint to connectivity and should be considered in corridor assessments. Our study shows how habitat analysis, connectivity assessment, and conflict risk mapping can be combined to guide conservation planning for identifying habitat networks and safe corridors for carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Landscape management practices that alter the degree of habitat fragmentation can significantly affect the genetic structure of animal populations. British red squirrels use “stepping stone” patches of habitat to move considerable distances through a fragmented habitat. Over the past few decades, the planting of a large conifer forest has connected groups of forest fragments in the north of England with those in southern Scotland. This “defragmentation” of the landscape has resulted in substantial genetic mixing of Scottish and Cumbrian genes in squirrel populations up to 100 kilometers from the site of the new forest. These results have implications for the conservation management of animal and plant species in fragmented landscapes such as those found in Britain.

AB  - 1. We use population synchrony as a new empirical method to assess functional connectivity – the permeability of landscapes given species dispersal attributes. Functional connectivity is important because well-connected metapopulations are expected to be more resistant to stochastic events causing extinction. 2. A variety of factors impact population synchrony, and we attempt to account for several of these (shared climate, distance, habitat similarity and location within the range) before investigating impacts of the suitability of the landscape between populations – a proxy for permeability to dispersal. 3. For the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria), we find that population synchrony is positively correlated with landscape suitability, suggesting that synchrony might be used to measure functional connectivity. 4. The importance of landscape suitability for population synchrony shows a humped relationship with distance – suitability has no effect between 0 and 20 km, then showing a significant positive effect above 20 km but with reduced (still significant) effect from 160 to 200 km. This suggests that relatively close populations may exchange sufficient migrants for synchronisation, regardless of the matrix suitability. In contrast, more separate populations are synchronised only where the landscape permits functional connectivity, most likely through dispersal between intermediate stepping-stone populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. We show that patterns of synchrony in long-term monitoring data can be used to estimate functional connectivity of landscapes. As such, this technique might be used to test and prioritise the effectiveness of land management for conservation of species and to mitigate the effects of climate change.

TI  - Habitat suitability and connectivity for an endangered brown bear population in the Iranian Caucasus
AU  - Habibzadeh, N.
AU  - Ashrafzadeh, M. R.
T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Context
The identification of suitable habitats and the assessment of connectivity are important to preserve key areas for small isolated, endangered populations. The brown bear, Ursus arctos, needs connectivity to supply the primary habitat requirements including food, water, shelter and space and to provide gene flow among all populations in the Iranian Caucasus.

Aims
In the present study, we investigated the status and habitat requirements of an endangered brown bear population within the Iranian Caucasus.

Methods
We applied an approach of consensus species distribution modelling to estimate the distribution of suitable habitats for brown bears using uncorrelated environmental variables. We then used the concept of circuit theory on resultant breeding patches to evaluate regional patterns of connectivity among these patches.

Key results
We predicted that ~9.10% of the study area is suitable for the brown bear at present. Ten patches (7.95% of the study area) were detected as suitable for breeding populations, where some populations are not able to survive without connectivity. The results indicated that habitat connectivity is sometimes widely affected by a high concentration of human activities such as roads, settlements and mining activities. Our findings showed that existing conservation areas could not safeguard the connectivity of brown bear habitats across the Iranian Caucasus.

Conclusions
Our results can help target fine-scaled planning approaches for the maintenance of bear meta-population structure, as well as facilitate the movement of individuals by protecting different landscape features.

Implications
The populations of brown bear are among the first to be harmed by the loss of habitat and connectivity, and, thus, this species is an appropriate focal species for linkage design that is beneficial for threatened populations of other co-existing species such as Persian leopard, grey wolf and Eurasian lynx. Moreover, the brown bear is among the most popular flagship species for conservation planning, which might increase public support for the restoration of habitat and linkages.

              Context
              Romania is currently one of the best-connected landscapes, with high-quality habitats and a high density of brown bears. However, regional development measures are needed for the nation’s economic growth, and without responsible government actions, these measures pose a threat to brown bear connectivity, a vital pillar of the entire Carpathian region. Despite having important implications for the species conservation, bears sex-specific behaviour has been overlooked in connectivity assessments.
            
            
              Objectives
              The study’s main goals were to (i) develop sex-specific distribution and connectivity models, (ii) assess the movement patterns differences between females and males, and (iii) identify high-quality areas to be secured for species connectivity conservation.
            
            
              Methods
              We designed a methodological framework based on interdisciplinary approaches and modelling tools for landscape connectivity combined with novel spatial analysis. Telemetry data of sixteen bears (females and males) were utilized to predict habitat selection (MaxEnt), and circuit-theoretic approaches (Circuitscape) were applied to identify the potential movement corridors of both sexes and high-priority areas.
            
            
              Results
              The obtained results provided new evidence on the uneven movement patterns and pathways used by males and females in the study region. Males’ movement preferences were related to river shores and dense forest coverage areas, avoiding urban areas, while females were predicted to move across forested and open areas and were more tolerant to human‐modified areas. Three high-quality areas were delineated for both sexes, and connectivity conservation efforts are needed due to the vicinity of anthropic pressures.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study depicts the usefulness of combining interdisciplinary approaches and provides planners, managers, and decision-makers with practical solutions to address sustainable design and management within the intervened landscapes. Using separate female and male spatial models for leading management and conservation measures, setting connectivity targets within environmental and impact assessments while adopting conservation easements could secure a safety network for biodiversity conservation in the Carpathians.

AB  - Abstract
            Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise in understanding the ecology of plant–pollinator networks and how this may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting plant–pollinator networks.

AB  - Roads and road verges can potentially have opposite impacts on organisms that move through the landscape. While road verges can be habitat for a large number of species, and have been proposed to act as dispersal corridors, roads can act as barriers to movement. This duality of roads and road verges has however rarely been assessed simultaneously, and it is unknown to what degree it depends on the amount of traffic on the road and on the habitat quality of the road verge. We used fluorescent powdered dye to track movements of flower-visiting insects along roads with varying traffic intensity, and in verges with contrasting habitat quality (flowering plant species richness and flower density). Insect movements along road verges were more frequent than movements into the adjacent habitats, indicating that verges act as corridors. The frequency of movements that required crossing the road was lower compared to the frequency of movements that did not, suggesting that roads are barriers. The movement patterns were independent of traffic intensity, but the barrier effect was stronger when the road verge had a higher density of flower resources. The effect of roads as a barrier and of the road verges as corridors were independent of each other. Our results suggest that flower-visiting insects tend to remain longer in road verges with high density of flowers and we therefore suggest that managing road verge habitats for an increased plant diversity will mitigate the known negative impacts of roads on insect populations.

AB  - The Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration is an urban agglomeration with some of the most intensive urbanization since 1980s. A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index PC gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined. This study is helpful to clarify the structural characteristics of regional ecological space and provide a theoretical basis for regional ecological planning.

AB  - With continuous urbanization and the fragmentation of green areas that affect human well-being, the establishment of a green infrastructure (GI) network is important in future urban planning. As a National Central City, Zhengzhou has a large population and is undergoing rapid economic development, resulting in an urgent demand for green space within the city in recent years. We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective. A GI network—consisting of an open space with vegetation as the main body—was designed for the main urban area of Zhengzhou using the traditional landscape ecological pattern theory, integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, circuit theory, and other methods. Evidently, the area of green space in Zhengzhou City in 2021 was 36 231.6 hm
              2
              . GI prediction results indicate that continuous expansion of the main urban area did not result in significant changes in the size of GI in the city. The GI within the urban area was relatively fragmented, forming 15 GI hubs, most of which were densely distributed along the edges of the main urban area. This study proposed the construction of a GI network with a target corridor and target points based on the existing corridor. This included the identification of seven target corridors and 15 target hubs; the total length of the corridor was 77.032 km, with a total of 31 target points. In summary, the GI network pattern of “one protection barrier, two lines, three loops and more points” was proposed. With new urban problems constantly emerging, this research could provide a theoretical reference basis for the planning of GI in the main urban area of the National Central City. The study provides concrete evidence on the optimum pattern for the construction of GI networks in cities with large populations.

TI  - Ecological Networks in Urban Forest Fragments Reveal Species Associations between Native and Invasive Plant Communities
AU  - Chauhan, Sonali

AB  - Forest fragments are characteristic features of many megacities that have survived the urbanisation process and are often represented by unique assemblages of flora and fauna. Such woodlands are representations of nature in the city—often dominated by non-native and invasive species that coexist with resilient native congeners and purposefully introduced flora. These forest fragments also provide significant ecosystem services to urban society and therefore, understanding their compositional patterns is of considerable importance for conservation and management. In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments. Our results show that urban woodlands primarily form invasive–native associations, and that major invasive species, such as Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara exclude each other while forming cliques. Our findings have implications for the conservation of these urban forests and highlight the importance of using network approaches in vegetation analysis.

AB  - El proceso de urbanización de Bogotá impacta directamente sobre la cobertura arbórea, debido a que los proyectos de construcción priorizan la tala en vez del traslado, y sus proyectos paisajísticos compensan insuficientemente su impacto negativo. La reducción progresiva de espacios verdes y arbolado disminuyen los hábitats necesarios para las aves. En la gestión del arbolado urbano, que incluye actividades de plantación, poda, traslado y tala, la ciudad aplica procedimientos para reducir su impacto sobre la avifauna. Su autoridad ambiental ha generado información para ampliar el conocimiento y permitir el entendimiento de la dinámica existente entre árboles y aves urbanas, que sirve de base para analizar la eficiencia de su acción, tanto en el procedimiento de manejo de avifauna como en el diseño y selección de especies en nuevas arborizaciones. Se presentan estadísticas de informes finales de manejo de avifauna de varias obras de infraestructura y los resultados de un estudio elaborado entre la Secretaría Distrital de Ambiente (sda) y la Asociación Bogotana de Ornitología (abo), en el que se formulan criterios técnicos para la conectividad ecológica con énfasis en la conservación de aves y la consolidación de procesos de restauración en la Estructura Ecológica Principal de la ciudad.

AB  - Conversion of lands to agriculture and development within remaining natural habitats have fragmented ecosystems and reduced wildlife populations. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted an incentive-based conservation strategy known as the Safe Harbor Program (SHP) to reduce the vulnerability of federally protected species located on private properties. In addition to protecting populations, the SHP also strives to enhance species viability by devising strategies to (re)connect populations among habitat patches. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the initial Safe Harbor agreement, developed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis, hereafter RCW) in the North Carolina Sandhills, in enhancing connectivity for that species. According to our results, breeding territories located on private properties enrolled in the SHP promoted dispersal of RCWs and enhanced overall population connectivity relative to otherwise similar territories located on non-SHP properties. Moreover, the SHP created extensive stepping-stone corridors throughout the region. Our analysis also showed that RCW connectivity will be negatively impacted directly and indirectly by encroaching urban growth. By combining an urban growth model with estimated connectivity, managers and conservation planners can identify which properties critical for connectivity are most threatened by urban encroachment. These results can help conservation planners develop strategic actions on private land based on the species specific movement ability, current landscapes and projected urban growth.

T2  - Restoration Ecology
AB  - Connectivity has been an accepted goal in ecological restoration of wilderness areas for some time, but it is a relatively new approach in urban areas. The connectivity analysis presented here explores the numbers and patterns of corridors required to connect urban green spaces as part of an overall biodiversity conservation strategy. Green spaces in this study were weighted based on size and a habitat requirement of 0.5 ha for a hypothetical indicator species. Thirteen potential networks were evaluated using Gamma, Beta, and Cost Ratio indices. The study zone contained 54 green spaces (habitat nodes) with a combined area of 636.5 ha in a total urban area of approximately 2,600 ha. Several models (Travelling Salesman, Paul Revere, and Least Cost to User) were used to evaluate possible connections. These results indicated that at least 325 linkages are necessary to connect half of the nodes. Such large numbers of linkages are only feasible by enhancing the matrix of backyard habitat, planted boulevards, and utility rights-of way found in a city. Strengthening such networks should work well to support the biota protected in urban parks and wildlife refuges and the seasonal migrants that sometimes depend on urban habitats for their survival.

AB  - Connecting natural habitats to allow animal and plant species to move has become a major issue in environmental policies. However, the identification and management of ecological networks raises difficulties due to the diversity of methods for analyzing connectivity and the lack of harmonized data at the country level. The aim of this study is to use graph theory to more finely integrate the functional connectivity of the landscape into the modeling of ecological networks at different spatial scales. The use of generic data and a standardized method makes it possible to identify core areas and corridors in a uniform way throughout the French metropolitan area and to overcome regional administrative boundaries. The results highlight a nationwide ecological network that can be compared to the existing green and blue infrastructure in a decision-making perspective.

AB  - The alteration of landscapes by human activities worldwide has forced many animal species to persist in remnants of natural habitats. One of the best examples of this process occurs in central-east Argentina, where the original prairies were almost completely replaced by agricultural land, cattle production areas and increasing urbanization. We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance; in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields.

TI  - Practical tool for landscape planning? An empirical investigation of network based models of habitat fragmentation
AU  - Andersson, Erik

T2  - Ecography
AB  - This study presents a graph-theoretical modelling approach using daily movements and habitat demands of different target bird species in an urban context to assess: 1) habitable land cover types, 2) threshold distances between patches of habitat, 3) the required minimum accessible habitat areas and 4) the effects of barriers and stepping stones. The modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden. The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as stepping stones and barriers were accounted for. Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land cover types are important. Finally, we argue that the modelling approach applied here may substantially improve landscape management and planning at scales ranging from whole landscapes down to neighbourhoods.

AB  - Explicit characterisation of the complexity of urban landscapes is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and for detecting the underlying social and ecological processes that shape them. Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency. Measuring species richness and beta diversity across 100 US metropolitan areas at the city and 1-km scales, we show that distinctive signatures of urban biodiversity can result from interactions between socioecological heterogeneity and connectivity, mediated by historical contingency.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) can provide social and ecological benefits, and the coordination of these two functions will largely advance human-nature harmony in cities. As such, we proposed a comprehensive framework to evaluate UGSs multifunctionality, i.e. the coupling coordination relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGSs. Wuhan City in Central China was taken as a case study, and multiple ecosystem service values of green space patches and the disordered use of UGSs multifunctionality were explored. The results demonstrated low-level coupling coordination of UGSs multifunctionality in Wuhan. More than 70% of UGSs were imbalanced, 27.91% of which featured small sizes, low connectivity and accessibility. We suggest that planners should optimize UGSs arrangement to improve species reachability, especially for species with dispersal distance less than 4 km, and to create 15-minute community life circles for residents at the same time. Our findings are expected to support the promotion of UGSs multifunctionality and the balance of urban development and habitat conservation.

T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - Aim To compare bird abundances in woodlands along gradients from the city centre to the peri-urban area. To evaluate the importance of the proportion of woodland within the city and in the peri-urban landscape to forest bird communities breeding in urban woodlands. To test whether fragmentation effects on birds were linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. Location A total of 34 Swedish cities with > 10,000 inhabitants in south-central Sweden. The study area covered 105,000 km2, in which 84% of the Swedish population of 9.1 million lives. Methods Repeated point count surveys were conducted in 2004 in a total of 474 woodlands. General linear models were used to test for possible differences in abundance along urban to peri-urban gradients, and to regress bird abundances in local urban woodlands on: (1) total woodland cover in the city, (2) total woodland cover in the peri-urban landscape, (3) the interaction between woodland cover in the city and in the peri-urban area, (4) region, and (5) human density. Results More than 12,000 individuals of 100 forest bird species were recorded. Of the 34 most common species detected, 13 bird species had higher abundances in urban than in peri-urban woodlands, and seven species showed the opposite trend. The bird community of urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with deciduous forests and tree nesters, whereas the bird community of peri-urban woodlands was characterized by species associated with coniferous woodland and ground nesters. Twelve species were significantly linearly associated with the proportion of urban woodland and/or the proportion of peri-urban woodland, and a further eight species were associated with the interaction between these two factors. Local breeding bird abundances of four species were significantly positively associated with the proportion of urban woodland only in farmland-dominated landscapes. Main conclusions Fragmentation effects on some urban birds are linked to the type of peri-urban matrix. In farmland landscapes, peri-urban woodlands may have been too scarce to act as a source of bird immigrants to fragmented urban woodlands. To maintain populations of specialized forest birds within cities in landscapes dominated by agriculture, it is of paramount importance to conserve any remaining urban woodlands.

AB  - Forest network development in urban areas faces the challenge from forest fragmentation, human-induced disturbances, and scarce land resources. Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities. The framework can also be applied to other areas after a sensitivity test of the model and the modification of the parameters to fit the local environment.

T2  - Ornithological Science
AB  - For the long-term survival of bird populations in urban areas, it is necessary to protect both bird habitats fragmented by urbanization and potential pathways for movement between them. However, urban pathways for waterbirds have rarely been studied. Suspecting that certain waterbird species that visit inland waters would tend to move along rivers, as movement pathways, we surveyed waterbird movement along the Kanda River in Tokyo, Japan in the winter of 2017/2018. We defined those species that very frequently (more than 95% of all flights) flew along the river as “river travelers”. Three species, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus, and Herring Gull L. argentatus proved to be river-dependent movers that frequently used the Kanda River as a pathway. The gulls relied more heavily on the river as a movement pathway than the cormorant. In this sense, urban rivers may play a role for these species that is analogous to that of linear vegetated spaces for terrestrial birds. In addition, the distribution of river travelers (especially Black-headed Gull) may have been affected by the extent of riverside vegetation alongside, and highways covering, the river. To protect movement pathways for gulls and cormorants in urban areas, it is necessary to consider the differences among bird species in terms of their relative dependence on urban rivers as movement pathways and their comparative susceptibilities to the impact of manmade structures covering the rivers.

AB  - Populations in fragmented urban remnants may be at risk of genetic erosion as a result of reduced gene flow and elevated levels of inbreeding. This may have serious genetic implications for the long-term viability of remnant populations, in addition to the more immediate pressures caused by urbanisation. The population genetic structure of the generalist skink Ctenotus fallens was examined using nine microsatellite markers within and among natural vegetation remnants within a highly fragmented urban matrix in the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia. These data were compared with samples from a large unfragmented site on the edge of the urban area. Overall, estimates of genetic diversity and inbreeding within all populations were similar and low. Weak genetic differentiation, and a significant association between geographic and genetic distance, suggests historically strong genetic connectivity that decreases with geographic distance. Due to recent fragmentation, and genetic inertia associated with low genetic diversity and large population sizes, it is not possible from these data to infer current genetic connectivity levels. However, the historically high levels of gene flow that our data suggest indicate that a reduction in contemporary connectivity due to fragmentation in C. fallens is likely to result in negative genetic consequences in the longer term.

AB  - Conservation of faunal diversity in highly urbanized landscapes is facilitated through the integration of anthropogenic and natural elements in urban green spaces. Roof gardens have the potential to provide resources for urban wildlife populations, yet they typically offer marginal ecological conditions relative to ground-level habitat so it is necessary to identify the factors associated with focal taxa diversity and abundance to better inform their planning, design, and management. We conducted 20 monthly surveys of diurnal bird and butterfly visitors to 30 urban roof gardens in the tropical city-state of Singapore. Sixty-five site variables were evaluated for their relative importance to four community diversity metrics (species richness, Simpson's diversity, abundance, and functional dispersion) using a conceptual framework relevant to key stakeholders involved in roof garden planning, design, and management. Surveys from a total of 80 observation hours per site recorded more than 23,000 independent bird and butterfly encounters, comprising 53 bird and 57 butterfly species, which represents 13% and 18% of the avifauna and butterfly fauna in Singapore, respectively. Twenty-four species (12 birds, 12 butterflies) were considered uncommon or rare. Reproductive behaviors (courtship, mating, or nesting) were noted in 35 species (20 birds, 15 butterflies). Understory birds were under-represented, whereas understory butterflies were over-represented compared to the overall Singapore fauna. Early morning noise showed strong negative linear correlations with diversity of both taxa, but this variable was also negatively associated with planted area, perhaps indicating proxy effects. Faunal diversity decreased asymptotically with height. Both managed and spontaneous floral diversity had clear positive effects on bird and butterfly diversity. Our results provide clear indication that tropical urban roof gardens can support a diverse subset of the bird and butterfly species assemblages. Site height, site area, and plant selection are suggested to play dominant roles in determining the attractiveness of roof gardens for wildlife. To a first approximation, roof gardens should be built lower than 50 m in height and contain planted areas larger than 1100 m2, as well as shrubs for birds and both managed and spontaneous nectar plant species for butterflies.

AB  - The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.

AB  - Question How is the abundance of exotic plants within urban forest remnants influenced by distance to the edges of forest boundaries and recreational trails? Location Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Methods Gradients in the cover of exotic plants, as well as the richness of exotic and native vascular species, were examined as a function of distance from anthropogenic forest boundaries and recreational trails. Plants were sampled in 2 m × 10 m and 10 m × 10 m plots distributed among 11 urban forest remnants. Randomization tests were used to quantify the distance of edge influence from both forest boundaries and trails, and to determine if there was an interaction between them. Results The cover and richness of exotic plants and richness of native species decreased with increasing distance from forest boundaries and trails. Edge influences extended to distances of ca. 50 and 3 m for forest boundaries and trails, respectively, and were stronger for measures of understorey than of overstorey vegetation. Vegetation was simultaneously influenced by both edge types such that exotic cover and richness were higher when in close proximity to two edges than when subject to either edge alone (i.e. a positive interaction). Conclusions It is important to consider the influence of edges in the design and management of forest remnants to improve the ability to conserve native biodiversity within cities. Results from this study may be used to guide the design of such systems, particularly by suggesting appropriately sized patches and trail densities.

AB  - Rapid urbanization throughout the world is expected to cause extensive loss of biodiversity in the upcoming decades. Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity. These findings suggest that maintaining and restoring watershed vegetation corridors in urban landscapes will aid efforts to conserve freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - Aim To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban–rural gradient. Location ‘Quercus–Acer’ (oak–sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK. Methods We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April–September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures anova and the environment–species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM). Results We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale. Main conclusions The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

AB  - Coenagrion mercuriale (Charpentier) (Odonata: Zygoptera) is one of Europe's most threatened damselflies and is listed in the European Habitats directive. We combined an intensive mark-release-recapture (MRR) study with a microsatellite-based genetic analysis for C. mercuriale from the Itchen Valley, UK, as part of an effort to understand the dispersal characteristics of this protected species. MRR data indicate that adult damselflies are highly sedentary, with only a low frequency of interpatch movement that is predominantly to neighbouring sites. This restricted dispersal leads to significant genetic differentiation throughout most of the Itchen Valley, except between areas of continuous habitat, and isolation by distance (IBD), even though the core populations are separated by less than 10 km. An urban area separating some sites had a strong effect on the spatial genetic structure. Average pairwise relatedness between individual damselflies is positive at short distances, reflecting fine-scale genetic clustering and IBD both within- and between-habitat patches. Damselflies from a fragmented habitat have higher average kinship than those from a large continuous population, probably because of poorer dispersal and localized breeding in the former. Although indirect estimates of gene flow must be interpreted with caution, it is encouraging that our results indicate that the spatial pattern of genetic variation matches closely with that expected from direct observations of movement. These data are further discussed with respect to possible barriers to dispersal within the study site and the ecology and conservation of C. mercuriale. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fine-scale genetic structuring in any zygopteran species.

T2  - Ecological Entomology
AB  - 1. Using a hierarchical generalised linear model we examined effects of landscape fragmentation (fragment area, isolation, and urbanisation of the surrounding matrix), within-fragment habitat quality (host plant abundance and plant species richness), and properties of the individual trees, on plant herbivore and parasitoid abundance. 2. The present study was conducted in 10 present-day fragments of native forest near Wellington, New Zealand ranging in size from 12 to 1068 ha. The tri-trophic study system consisted of the plant Macropiper excelsum, its main insect herbivore Cleora scriptaria, and two parasitoid wasps: the braconids Aleiodes declanae (endemic specialist) and Meteorus pulchricornis (exotic generalist). 3. Parasitism by Aleiodes declanae was significantly higher in more isolated fragments and was negatively correlated with parasitism rates by other species, and positively correlated with tree size. 4. Parasitism by Meteorus pulchricornis was not related to landscape fragmentation, but was positively related to host larval densities measured at the individual plant-level, and declined with increasing plant species richness at the plot-level. 5. Herbivory was positively related to the local abundance of host plants, but was unrelated to the fragment-level properties. 6. Species showed individualistic associations to habitat fragmentation, with properties of within-patch quality often proving to be more important to the abundance and composition of this tri-trophic community. Parasitoids appear to display a variety of associations to fragmentation, rather than having a typical or general relationship as predicted by the trophic level hypothesis.

AB  - Forested natural areas in cities provide a range of social, ecological, economic, and health benefits. Ensuring the delivery of these benefits requires an understanding of current and potential future forest conditions, yet urban forest dynamics are not well-understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining forest structure and composition in 126 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes (large [95–126 ha], medium [1–19 ha], and small [0.05–0.65 ha] patches) in the city of New Haven, CT. We detected significant shifts in forest structure and composition suggesting a suite of distinct successional trajectories within each patch size. Large patches comprised 95% native tree species in the canopy (>5 cm dbh), sapling (1–5 cm dbh), and seedling (<1 cm dbh) layers, suggesting that these large patches will continue to be native-dominated in the future—a primary objective for urban forest management. Moreover, in these large patches, shifts in the dominant species in each stratum suggest that as large patches move through succession they will transition from moderately shade-tolerant forest types (i.e., oaks) to shade-tolerant types (i.e., American beech)—a similar successional trajectory to surrounding second-growth forests in the region. Medium patches were the most heterogeneous patch size sampled. Despite this heterogeneity, they generally resembled large patches in the canopy and sapling layers but diverged in the seedling layer. In medium patches, the invasive Norway maple replaced American beech as primary seedling species suggesting a future shift toward non-native-dominated forest in the future. Small patches were the most compositionally and structurally distinct patch size sampled. Only 36% of the canopy trees and saplings in small patches were native species; however, this increased to 71% native in the seedling layer. Additionally, the most important seedling species included those that are bird-dispersed highlighting the potentially valuable role that these small, non-native, forest fragments play as wildlife corridors. Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple forest types, dynamics, and conditions can be found within a single city and that forest patch size offers a helpful framework to begin to parse out these differences.

T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - Estimating the abundance or density of populations is fundamental to the conservation and management of species, and as landscapes become more fragmented, maintaining landscape connectivity has become one of the most important challenges for biodiversity conservation. Yet these two issues have never been formally integrated together in a model that simultaneously models abundance while accounting for connectivity of a landscape. We demonstrate an application of using capture–recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture–recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km2 area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes. This study provides an application of capture–recapture models based on ecological distance, allowing us to directly estimate landscape connectivity. This approach should be widely applicable to provide simultaneous direct estimates of density, space usage, and landscape connectivity for many species.

AB  - Evaluating fine-scale population structure of multiple species in the same landscape increases our ability to identify common patterns as well as discern ecological differences among species’ landscape genetic relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99% of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (FST and Dc) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P < 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change.

AB  - Rapid changes in agricultural landscape structure and composition affect many different farmland biotas, including carnivores, which are a key element of ecosystem stability, yet little is known about their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1–7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

AB  - In an unprecedented response to the rapid decline in wild tiger populations, the Heads of Government of the 13 tiger range countries endorsed the St. Petersburg Declaration in November 2010, pledging to double the wild tiger population. We conducted a landscape analysis of tiger habitat to determine if a recovery of such magnitude is possible. The reserves in 20 priority tiger landscapes can potentially support >10,000 tigers, almost thrice the current estimate. However, most core reserves where tigers breed are small and land-use change in rapidly developing Asia threatens to increase reserve and population isolation. Maintaining population viability and resilience will depend upon a landscape approach to manage tigers as metapopulations. Thus, both site-level protection and landscape-scale interventions to secure habitat corridors are simultaneous imperatives. Co-benefits, such as payment schemes for carbon and other ecosystem services, should be employed as strategies to mainstream landscape conservation in tiger habitat into development processes.

AB  - We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of breeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were significantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Numbers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed elsewhere. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small- and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.

AU  - Fusco, Nicole A.

T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Natural landscape heterogeneity and barriers resulting from urbanization can reduce genetic connectivity between populations. The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity of Eurycea bislineata (northern two‐lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.

TI  - Widespread genetic connectivity of feral pigeons across the Northeastern megacity
AU  - Carlen, Elizabeth

T2  - Evolutionary Applications
AB  - Urbanization may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, we examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the eastern United States. We focused our sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). We performed ddRAD‐Seqon 473 samples, recovered 35,200 SNPs, and then used multiple evolutionary clustering analyses to investigate population structuring. These analyses revealed that pigeons formed two genetic clusters—a northern cluster containing samples from Boston and Providence and a southern cluster containing all other samples. This substructuring is possibly due to reduced urbanization across coastal Connecticut that separates Boston and Providence from New York and mid‐Atlantic cities. We found that pairs of pigeons within 25 km are highly related (Mantel r = 0.217, p = .001) and that beyond 50 km, pigeons are no more related than they would be at random. Our analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. We conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in feral pigeons.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) can simultaneously provide social and ecological benefits for humans. Although numerous studies have evaluated the multifunctional benefits of urban green space, few of them have determined the differentiated conservation priorities of UGS towards the tradeoff relationship of multiple UGS functions. Here, we proposed an integrated framework to explore the targeted conservation strategies of UGS patches. Specifically, the circuit theory model and gravity floating catchment area method were adopted to evaluate ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS under multiple scenarios in terms of different species dispersal distances and resident travelling modes, and Pareto ranking analysis was utilized to identify conservation priorities of UGS. Wuhan City in central China was taken as a case study. The results show that Wuhan exhibits low synergic relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS, and only approximately 7.51% of UGS patches on average rank high. Based on the frequency of UGS Pareto ranks under different scenarios, the differentiated conservation strategy was developed, which identified 10 key green areas that need to be protected and 11 green areas that need to be restored. This work is expected to provide an applicable framework to identify key UGS patches and assist in urban planning and layout optimization of multifunctional UGS in Wuhan, China.

TI  - Analyzing the pattern and connectivity of urban green spaces: A case study of Izmir, Turkey
AU  - Hepcan, Şerif
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The primary concerns in this study were to quantify the connectivity and green space pattern using landscape metrics (PLAND, NP, AREA_MN and CONNECT) in the central districts of the city of Izmir. The primary research materials included thirteen 1:25,000 scale standard topographical maps and IKONOS satellite image with 1 m resolution. The PLAND scores revealed that while the urban fabric occupied almost 26 % of the study area, the urban green spaces covered only 1.45 %. This was also the lowest score in proportion to the areas of other land-use/cover classes. Furthermore, the results of NP and MPS indicated that the configuration of urban green spaces was very patchy and highly fragmented. Likewise, using CONNECT, the overall connectivity score of urban green spaces was 0.12, which was the lowest score of all areas measured the metrics. The Güzelbahçe district seemed to hold the most promise for connectivity, with a CONNECT score of 3.75. On the other hand, the Bornova district presented the least promising case in terms of connectivity, with a score of 0.59. In the study area, the correlations between the size of the districts/built-up areas and the CONNECT scores of the urban green spaces were found to be "non-significant" (P<0.01). The ultimate goals were to increase the amount of systematically planned urban green spaces and set up a green infrastructure in Izmir. In the case of Izmir, a master planning approach, which uses a systematic and comprehensive method to guide urban green spaces, is necessary to develop planning and design strategies for fully functional and multi-purpose urban green space systems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The process of ecosystem fragmentation causes three types of changes in the ecosystem: changes of abiotic, direct biotic and indirect biotic nature. Among these changes, some of them are the microclimatic alterations, edge effect, decrease of the gene flow and losses of biodiversity, among others. In this way, the present study aimed to evaluate the environmental quality of forest remnants in a highly urbanized area through environmental indicators and landscape metrics, such as total area, circularity index, shape of forest fragments, nuclear area, connectivity between them, use and occupation around and distance from the nearest neighbor. The indicators were evaluated according to the methodologies established in the literature and grouped into an index to determine the environmental quality of each forest remnant. The index consisted of the sum of the weighted values for each indicator, according to its classification. The results indicate that most forest remnants evaluated in the study area present medium environmental quality, which demonstrates the degree of edge effect to which they are submitted, and this emphasizes the need for appropriate management actions in these areas, in order to soften such external pressures and ensure long-term sustainability. In addition, it was also identified that the metrics related to the area are essentially important for the determination of the environmental quality of forest remnants.

AB  - Competition for land is increasing as demand for multiple land uses and ecosystem services rises. Land regulation of the principles of landscape ecology is necessary to develop more sustainable approaches to land use planning. The research evaluated the present land patterns and determined best practices for its regulation of Dongwang Township in Quyang County, located in the Taihang Mountain area of Hebei Province, China. The research used the landscape ecology theory to construct an index system for landscape pattern analysis based on the GIS and Fragstats 3.3 software. In this study, we examined the specific reasons that landscape ecology is superior to traditional methods in land consolidation planning and design, which is conducive to the comprehensive development of land ecological benefits. Landscape ecological planning can effectively reduce landscape fragmentation and improve intensive management. The result found that the descending order of the Shannon index was current landscape, landscape ecological planning, and traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning could protect the natural diversity than traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning enables the creation of long corridors, with higher densities and connectivity and lower average corridor widths than traditional planning. Besides, it can improve ecological service function values in the study area to varying degrees, thus discouraging residents from limiting themselves to grain production. This research has great potential to improve the visibility of ecosystem services in local land use planning and, thus, to improve the ecological functioning of future landscapes.

              specimens collected in three areas within Buenos Aires city with varying levels of urbanization/land use: highly urbanized Area 1, intermediate Area 2 and poorly urbanized Area 3. We found an inverse association between urbanization levels and spatial genetic structure. Populations from highly urbanized Area 1 did not present genetic structure whereas two and three clusters were detected in Areas 2 and 3, respectively. In the case of Area 3, initial analyses showed separation in clusters was mostly due to elevated consanguinity within sites although three clusters were still detected after closely related individuals were discarded. Mosquitoes around each site displayed a high degree of isolation, evidencing a close dependence between the vector and human dwellings. Interestingly, specimens from distant boroughs (within the limits of the city) and the city’s outskirts formed a single cluster with inner city sites (Area 1), highlighting the role of passive transport in shaping population structure. Genetic distances were poorly correlated with geographic distances in Buenos Aires, suggesting a stronger influence of passive than active dispersal on population structure. Only Area 2 displayed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern (p = 0.046), with males dispersing more than females (p = 0.004 and p = 0.016, respectively). Kinship analyses allowed us to detect full-siblings located 1.5 km apart in Area 1, which could be due to an extreme event of active female dispersal. Effective population size was higher in Area 2 confirming that cemeteries represent highly favourable environments for

AB  - The application of ecological theory in urban planning is becoming more important as land managers focus on increasing biodiversity to improve human welfare in cities. Authorities must decide not only what types of biodiversity-focused infrastructure should be prioritized, but also where new resources should be positioned and existing resources protected or enhanced. Measuring the contribution of green infrastructure to landscape connectivity can maximise the successful return and conservation of urban nature. By using ecological connectivity theory as a planning tool, the effect of different interventions (both positive and negative) on the ease with which wildlife can move across the landscape can be compared. Here we outline an approach to a) quantify ecological connectivity for different urban wildlife species and b) use this to test different urban planning scenarios using QGIS. We demonstrate extensions which improve the application of this method as a planning tool:•Conversion of the effective mesh size value (meff) to a “probability of connectedness” (Pc, for easier interpretation by local government and comparisons between planning scenarios).•An approach for measuring species-specific connectivity, including how to decide what spatial information should be included and which types of species might be most responsive to connectivity planning.•Guidance for using the method to compare different urban planning scenarios.

AB  - Urbanization results in pervasive habitat fragmentation and reduces standing genetic variation through bottlenecks and drift. Loss of genomewide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genomewide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genomewide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genomewide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genomewide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations. This study is the first to examine loss of genomewide SNP variation along an urban-to-rural gradient and quantify urbanization as a driver of population genomic patterns.

TI  - The Ecological Drivers of Urban Tick-Borne Disease Emergence
AU  - VanAcker, Meredith C.
AB  - Tick-borne diseases cause in enormous burden on human, livestock, and wildlife health globally and are driven by the increasing abundance and geographic expansion of medically important tick species. More recently, tick-borne disease emergence is occurring in urban landscapes due to complex feedbacks between the environment, humans, wildlife, and ticks. In this dissertation, I focus on the ecological conditions that allow for tick-borne disease emergence in a city. I use a combination of spatial landscape modeling, empirical data collection, wildlife movement tracking to determine drivers of zoonotic hazards in New York City, NY, and employ vector genomics to examine vector dispersal in the northeastern United States. In chapter one, I pair tick collection throughout the five boroughs of New York City with landscape connectivity modeling to examine how green space connectivity and habitat availability affects the density and infection of questing nymphs – an important epidemiological measure of human risk for tick-borne diseases. I found that green spaces that were highly connected for deer had higher nymph density and infection prevalence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. In chapter two, I use camera trapping, live trapping, and tick collection on Staten Island, NY, to examine how landscape fragmentation – through changing habitat size and connectivity – shapes the host community available for questing Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Further, I examined whether patterns in host species abundance and activity correlate with the density of nymphs and their infection prevalence with three different pathogens that vary in host-specificity, B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. I found associations between host species and the size and connectivity of the park habitat, identified host species which amplified and removed ticks in the environment, and determined links between host activity and abundance and the infection prevalence of nymphs with host-specific pathogens. In chapter three, I utilize movement data from 59 white-tailed deer on Staten Island, NY, to assess the drivers of movement and its impact on tick-borne disease hazard across the landscape. I found that white-tailed deer avoid anthropogenic development at fine spatial scales when establishing home ranges but select for anthropogenic resources within their home range, increasing the potential to distribute ticks into environments that interface with humans. Finally in chapter four, I use double digest Restriction Associated DNA sequencing to examine the genetic differentiation of six I. scapularis populations across the Northeast region. I found high levels of gene flow across a spatial scale of 400 km, likely resulting from frequent host-mediated dispersal events combined with large I. scapularis populations. Taken together, this work emphasizes that host movement and ecology are critical determinants of urban tick-borne disease emergence through directing vector and pathogen dispersal, serving as pathogen reservoirs in urban habitats, and interfacing with humans in unique ways that increase human exposure to zoonotic hazards.

TI  - The influence of urban green spaces on declining bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
AU  - Beckham, Jessica L.
AB  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are adept pollinators of countless cultivated and wild flowering plants, but many species have experienced declines in recent decades. Though urban sprawl has been implicated as a driving force of such losses, urban green spaces hold the potential to serve as habitat islands for bumble bees. As human populations continue to grow and metropolitan areas become larger, the survival of many bumble bee species will hinge on the identification and implementation of appropriate conservation measures at regional and finer scales. North Texas is home to some the fastest-growing urban areas in the country, including Denton County, as well as at least two declining bumble bee species (B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus). Using a combination of field, molecular DNA and GIS methods I evaluated the persistence of historic bumble bee species in Denton County, and investigated the genetic structure and connectivity of the populations in these spaces. Field sampling resulted in the discovery of both B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus in Denton County's urban green spaces. While the relative abundance of B. fraternus in these spaces was significantly lower than historic levels gleaned from museum records, that of B. pensylvanicus was significantly higher. Statistical analyses found that both bare ground and tree cover surrounding sample sites were negatively associated with numbers of bumble bee individuals and hives detected in these green spaces. Additionally, limited genetic structuring of bumble bee populations was detected, leading to the conclusion that extensive gene flow is occurring across populations in Denton County.

TI  - A multiscale investigation of snake habitat relationships and snake conservation in Illinois
AU  - Cagle, Nicolette L.
AB  - Snake populations in the North American tallgrass prairie appear to be declining, yet data unavailability impedes the development of enhanced ecological understanding of snake species-habitat relationships and also hinders snake conservation efforts. This study addresses both issues for the snakes of Illinois in two steps.
In a two-year mark-recapture study at twenty-two sites within six northern Illinois prairie preserves, I investigated snake species-habitat relationships using habitat variables at three scales: microhabitat (< 100 m), landscape (1–10 km), and regional (> 10 km). A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel traps and sheet metal cover. The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that Illinois snake populations have declined.
At the microhabitat scale, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests revealed a relationship between snake species composition and elevation. At the landscape-scale, snake species composition varied along an agricultural-urban cover gradient. Classification and regression trees and maximum entropy models (Maxent) were used to identify the scales at which snake species-habitat relationships were strongest. Six of seven regression trees for individual snakes species contained habitat variables at the landscape scale. Important landscape characteristics included patch size, isolation, and land cover, metrics that strongly covary with habitat loss. Microhabitat features only appeared in the regression trees of two species and in three Maxent models. This study indicates that habitat loss has shaped the current distribution of snake species in Illinois's remnant prairies and that snake conservation efforts should emphasize the landscape-scale.
Finally, I developed a risk ranking system based on natural and life history characteristics to assess the conservation status of Illinois's 38 snake species. Cluster analysis identified eight groups of snakes, similar in terms of risk factors, with high risk species sharing characteristics such as large body size, long life span, limited habitat breadth, and a high anthropogenic threat ranking. Here, I emphasize the need for basic demographic studies on snakes and suggest that ranking systems be used with population data (when available) and expert opinion to identify snake species of conservation concern in other regions.

TI  - Reconnecting rattlers: Identifying potential connectivity for an urban population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes
AU  - Choquette, Jonathan Daniel
AB  - In an urbanizing region of Southwestern Ontario, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) persists in taligrass prairie remnants. Maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is a recommended strategy to encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of this genetically and ecologically distinct population. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost model and to evaluate the outputs with road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat patches which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. A subset of pathways requires further study. This research will guide the location of interventions aimed at increasing connectivity for this species, provide a basis for connectivity design for other species within the study landscape, and inform the use of a modelling approach to connectivity analysis in urban landscapes.

TI  - Influence of a highly interactive species upon bird diversity within a gradient of urbanization
AU  - Salamack, Kristin A.
AB  - Urbanization and subsequent habitat fragmentation have significantly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus ). Studies suggest that prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence bird species diversity, abundance, and richness. Past research was conducted on native prairie and few studies investigated whether this relationship exists in an urban/suburban setting. The landscape changes that reduced the prairie dog's range also impact bird species directly, resulting in habitat loss and isolation. I performed bird counts on 20 habitat fragments stratified along an urban gradient in the Denver metropolitan area to examine the influence of fragment area, isolation, and distance from city center on bird diversity measures. I used 12 fragments (six colonized by prairie dogs, six uncolonized by prairie dogs) in a paired study to determine whether the presence of prairie dogs influences bird diversity measures in an urban setting. Diversity measures were generally higher on colonized fragments for every season except winter; however, these trends were not statistically significant. Diversity measures for the paired study increased significantly with increasing area and increasing isolation. When I analyzed all 20 habitat fragments, I found that larger fragment area and fragments further from the city center exhibited significantly higher diversity measures in univariate models. I found that diversity measures were significantly higher on fragments that were older, larger, and had higher forb cover in multivariate models. Future biodiversity studies along the urban gradient in Denver should include an analysis of the matrix adjacent to habitat fragments and should employ better indices for estimating urbanization. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as highly interactive species in urban systems should also include an analysis of other taxa.

TI  - Response of waterbird communities to habitat and landscape structure along an urban gradient in Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Burnette, Riley
AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of abundance and biodiversity. Additionally, urban rivers also offer environmental amenities and can be catalysts for social and economic revitalization in human communities. Despite its importance for both humans and wildlife, blue space in cities used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. My principal objective was to determine how urbanization and water availability affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. I surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a LTER long-term study system located in Phoenix, Arizona. Water physiognomy (shape and size) was the largest factor in shaping the bird community. Connectivity was an important element for waterbird diversity, but not abundance. Urbanization had guild-specific effects on abundance but was not important for waterbird diversity. Habitat-level environmental characteristics were more important than land use on waterbird abundance, as well as diversity. Diving and fish-eating birds were positively associated with large open bodies of water, whereas dabbling ducks, wading birds, and marsh species favored areas with large amounts of shoreline and emergent vegetation. My study supports that Phoenix blue space offers an important subsidy to migrating waterbird communities; while alternative habitat is not a replacement, it is important to consider as part of the larger conservation picture as traditional wetlands decline. Additionally, arid cities have the potential to support high levels of waterbird biodiversity, heterogeneous land use matrix can be advantageous in supporting regional diversity, and waterbirds are tolerant of urbanization if proper resources are provided via the habitat. The implications of this study are particularly relevant to urban planning in arid cities; Phoenix alone contains over 1,400 bodies of water, offering the opportunity to design and improve urban blue space to optimize potential habitat while providing public amenities.

TI  - Construction and application of ecological property evaluation index system for urban parks: a case study of xiamen urban parks
AU  - Xiao, Liang Chang
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by author

As an important component of eco-city construction, improving the ecological property of urban parks is the development direction of modern urban parks, however, there is still lack of a valid index system to evaluate ecological property of urban parks. The present study focused on the connotation of ecological property, set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks with Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thereafter, seven typical urban parks in Xiamen were taken as a case to verify the index system. Firstly, this study set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks taking the rationality of ecological structure as well as the efficiency of functions as the criterias. The index system consisted of four aspects, which were community structure, landscape pattern, ecological service function and garden ornamental function. Then the degree of ecological property was divided into four grades according to their scores, which were excellent(grade I), good(grade II), fair(grade III), and poor(grade IV). Secondly, we measured the principal indexes such as vegetation quantity, tree species diversity, landscape diversity, birds diversity, and carbon fixation and oxygen release, decrease of temperature and increase of humidity, dust-retention and noise reduction in seven typical parks of Xiamen. According to their vegetation characteristics, seven parks were classified to semi-natural parks(Huweishan Park, Xianyue Park and Zhonglun Park)and artificial parks(Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, Bailuzhou Park and Huli Park). Finally, these seven parks were evaluated using the index system and the evaluating scores were in the order of Huweishan Park(0.6830, II)>Xianyue Park(0.6698, II)>Zhongshan Park(0.6365, II)>Nanhu Park(0.6120, II)>Zhonglun Park(0.6057, II)>Huli Park(0.5181, III)>Bailuzhou Park(0.5067, III). According to our investigation and evaluation, the structure and function of the seven parks were further analyzed. The results indicated that Huweishan Park and Xianyue Park had higher green space ratios and native species percentages, richer community levels and more diverse bird species than artificial parks. Their average patch areas were larger and plaque integrity and connectivity were better, but the landscape diversities were lower. These two parks thus had better ecological service functions, but weak garden ornamental functions. In Zhonglun Park, the community structure was simplified after artificial modification, and its ecological service functions were poorer than the other semi-natural pakrs. In the artificial parks, Zhongshan Park and Nanhu Park had more diverse tree species than the others, with more rational collocation of native species and exotic species. The landscape types were diverse, but their fragmentation degrees were high. In Bailuzhou Park, the community structure was simple and tree species were poor. In Huli Park, there was a large number of recreation facilities and water surface area and the green space ratio was low. With regard to functions, Zhongshan Park had strong ecological service functions while the other three artificial parks had weak ecological service functions, but strong garden ornamental functions. In a word, there were better ecological structures and ecological service functions in semi-natural parks, but stronger ornamental functions in artificial parks. This study set up the index system for evaluating ecological property with strong scientificity and feasibility. It had certain reference value to ecological construction of urban

AB  - The land-sparing/land-sharing debate remains an oversimplified framework to evaluate landscape management strategies that aim to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation. Still, biodiversity-yield curves, on which the framework has relied, provide valuable qualitative information on biodiversity's sensitivity to agricultural practices, and much research has studied this relationship. But the potential effect of landscape configuration on biodiversity's response to intensification has rarely been considered; besides, studies have often taken yield as an indicator of agricultural management and have generalized conclusions from studying particular taxonomic groups. In this work we adapt a metacommunity model to analyze factors that shape biodiversity's response to agricultural intensification while addressing some of the simplifications of the sparing/sharing dichotomy. In particular, we study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined gradient in matrix quality and configurational heterogeneity of habitat patches, and considering community dynamics. We found that species richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape heterogeneity increases, as minimum viable population increases or as habitat area decreases. Our work highlights the interdependent effects of heterogeneity, habitat availability and matrix quality on biodiversity and contributes to a nuanced understanding of ecological and landscape factors that enable a robust response of biodiversity in the face of spatiotemporal perturbations.

AB  - Abstract
          Habitat fragmentation related to human activities modifies the distribution and the demographic trajectory of a species, often leading to genetic erosion and increased extinction risks. Understanding the impact of fragmentation on different species that co-exist in the same area becomes extremely important. Here we estimated the impact produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species sampled in the same locations. Our main goal was to identify shared and private factors in the comparison among species. 199 bank voles and 194 wood mice were collected in 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape, and genotyped at 8 and 7 microsatellites, respectively. Genetic variation and structure were analysed with standard approaches. Effective migration surfaces, isolation by resistance analysis, and regression with randomization were used to study isolation by distance and to estimate the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. Genetic structure was similarly affected by isolation by distance in these species, but the isolation-by-resistance analysis suggests that i) the wood mouse has constrained patterns of dispersal across woodland patches and facilitated connectivity in cultivated areas; ii) the bank vole connectivity is hindered by urban areas, while permeability is facilitated by the presence of woodlands, and cultivated terrains. Habitat loss and fragmentation can therefore influence genetic structure of small sympatric mammal species in different ways, and predicting the genetic consequences of these events using only one species may be misleading.

TI  - Botanical processes in urban derelict spaces
AU  - Austin, Kevin Charles
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the processes that determine the richness and composition of plant communities on derelict land in the West Midlands. Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods. Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables. Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications, functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities. The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks. Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species. Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth. Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either patch density or the presence of linear features. These findings have considerable implications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation. In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species. The most important factors influencing the composition of sites were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity. Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.

TI  - A multi-scale exploration into the spatial patterns of a three dimensional urban tree infrastructure (uti): integrating landscape connectivity, network resilience, and social deprivation
AU  - Bishop, O. J.
AB  - A functionally connected urban tree infrastructure (UTI) contributes to ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Variation in tree height is an important attribute influencing movement of passerines, habitat quality and landscape patterns. UTI provided ES are particularly beneficial in the most deprived areas of a city. Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach. The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests. The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold. The resilience of Salford’s UTI relies on the connectivity of canopies within 4 to 5 sub-connected regions, depending on passerine perception, increasing to 10 -16 smaller regions for canopies above 17.1m. The resilience and stability of these sub-connected regions were often reliant on a central canopy patch. UTI composition is related negatively with deprivation, UTI configuration is related positively, while structural diversity of canopy heights revealed no correlation with deprivation. The research in this thesis contributes to the debates on how to best manage the UTI for both people and nature. The findings of this thesis have a number of important implications for future urban landscape management, especially as previously unknown landscape patterns have been identified.

TI  - Using landscape structure indices to understand the possible impacts of landscape change: Case of the mountain preserves in the city of Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Esbah, Hayriye
AB  - Historic land use development in Phoenix has impacted the city's ecologically valuable open spaces. This dissertation studies the possible effect of landscape change between 1968 and 1998 on the South Mountain Preserve (SMP) and Phoenix Mountains Preserve (PMP). Recommendations for a future development pattern are provided. Three principal analyses are employed: (1) matrix utility analysis; (2) isolation analysis; and (3) connectivity analysis. Black and white aerial photographs of the study area were used for the investigation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results indicate: (1) a decline in matrix utility value of 21.65% for SMP, and 36.50% for PMP, (2) an increase in isolation value of 1.28% for SMP, and 285% for PMP, and (3) a decline in the overall matrix connectivity value of 67.8%. The conclusions of the research are that the ecological values of the mountain preserves may change due to the historic land use pattern: (1) the areas surrounding the mountain preserves were occupied by environmentally less sensitive land use types, (2) existing open space patches became smaller and more isolated due to increasing fragmentation, (3) connectivity between the open space patches was paralyzed as the detrimental effect of urban sprawl, and (4) PMP experienced more decline in the ecological values than SMP. Recommendations primarily include: (1) encouraging more environmentally compatible land uses around the preserves, (2) creating buffer zones, (3) considering both content and the context of the preserve in management actions, (4) developing effective land acquisition and zoning plans, (5) unifying preservation efforts of different local and government agencies, (6) improving connectivity with other open-space systems, and (7) maintaining near-natural levels of biodiversity in the urban matrix.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Habitat Restoration on Shrubland Specialists: Case Study on the New England Cottontail and Shrubland Birds
AU  - Bauer, Melissa L.
AB  - Loss and fragmentation of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States due to succession, suppression of natural disturbance regimes, and development (Cronon 1983, Litvaitis 1993) have resulted in declines of populations of shrubland specialist species, including the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and shrubland birds (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Schlossberg & King 2007). The New England cottontail’s range has declined by over 86% (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Fenderson et al. 2014, Brubaker et al. 2014) and remaining populations are small and exhibit fine-scale structure, limited dispersal, and loss of metapopulation function (Fenderson 2011, 2014, Cheeseman 2017, Chapter 1). In the Northeast, declining species of shrubland birds outnumber increasing species three to one (Schlossberg & King 2007). In response to these losses, active management is ongoing to maintain and create shrubland habitat on the landscape to restore populations of specialists dependent on this habitat type. Given the extensive investments and collaboration focused on restoring shrubland habitats in New England, research is needed to monitor the effects of habitat creation on populations of shrubland specialists. Understanding how shrubland specialists are responding to ongoing habitat creation will inform additional restoration strategies in an adaptive management context, an iterative process of incorporating new information into management practices and learning from previous management outcomes.
Shrubland habitat creation and management in New England is largely focused on restoring habitat for the New England cottontail, with the idea that other species will also benefit. The New England cottontail is a highly threatened shrubland obligate requiring multiple patches of shrubland habitat within a short dispersal distance to support viable metapopulations long-term. Much of this management has been initiated by the New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative in response to the cottontail’s nine-year candidate listing status under the Endangered Species Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Keystone Initiative. Conservation efforts implemented for the New England cottontail have included the development of a range-wide inter-agency conservation strategy, designation of focal habitat restoration areas and habitat acreage and cottontail population recovery goals, engagement with private organizations and landowners to create shrubland habitat, implementation of a range-wide cottontail occupancy monitoring protocol, and public outreach and education (Fuller & Tur 2012). Habitat management underway incorporates techniques to set back forest succession, including harvesting trees, cutting and mowing to promote shrub regrowth, planting to improve old field habitat, and controlled burning on fire-maintained habitats like pitch pine-scrub oak. Landscape-level conservation design has been initiated to identify best parcels in terms of vegetation type and patch size that can be targeted for restoration (Tash & Litvaitis 2007, Fuller et al. 2011).
Knowing how other species respond to widespread habitat management for cottontails is important to understand the full impacts and benefits of currently implemented management and to inform future management strategies. Given the resources invested in restoring shrubland habitat for cottontail populations, and the potential for other shrubland specialist species to benefit from this restoration, designating the New England cottontail a representative species could benefit strategic management for multiple species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Representative species designations are a tool for strategic management to provide the greatest benefit for the most species with available resources. Research is needed to identify which additional species would benefit most from restoration to create habitat for cottontails. I investigated shrubland specialist birds as a suite of species that could benefit from habitat management for cottontails, given declining population trends for shrubland birds and their high conservation need in the Northeast.
In this thesis, I investigated the effects of habitat restoration on shrubland specialists in three case studies focused on New England cottontails and shrubland birds.
In Chapter 1, I used genetic tools to assess the population structure, genetic diversity, effective population size, and census population size of an isolated New England cottontail population in an urban landscape in Londonderry, New Hampshire. I documented attributes of small populations that pose conservation challenges, including limited dispersal and loss of metapopulation function (Chandler et al. 2015), low genetic diversity, high relatedness (Brook et al. 2002, O’Grady et al. 2006), skewed sex ratios (Tella 2001, Clout et al. 2002), and stochastic decline on isolated patches (Stacey & Taper 1992). I used a resistance surface approach to highlight areas of potential connectivity in the landscape, including powerlines, a shrub wetland, and rail corridor. I parameterized a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that serves as a proof-of-concept for future work to compare the outcomes of alternate restoration scenarios on cottontail population size, genetic diversity, connectivity, and ability to persist in fragmented landscapes given best-case restoration scenarios.

TI  - Evolution and Ecology of Urban Pigeons (Columba livia) in Northeastern North America
AU  - Carlen, Elizabeth Jane
AB  - Urbanization is drastically changing landscapes across the globe leading to changes in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within cities. This urban landscape change may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, I examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the Northeastern United States. I focused my sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). I performed ddRAD‐Seq on 473 samples. My analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. I conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in pigeons. Additionally, spatial genetic patterns may diverge between cities as food accessibility, nesting site availability, and eradication policies differ. Pigeon hobbyists (people who collect, breed, trade, and race pigeons) also vary by region leading to differing degrees of public tolerance for pigeons and impacting the spatial genetic patterns. Fancy and racing pigeons display a variety of characters which are often seen in the feral population, suggesting that these breeds may partially contribute to feral populations. I found that pigeon population structure is influenced by continued introduction of racing/fancy pigeons and the local conditions including attitudes towards pigeons, management practices, and food availability. Furthermore, variation in behavioral traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behavior. I examined the flight initiation distance of pigeons across New York City, USA. I then assessed this behavioral response across the landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment, and the ecological community. I found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity demonstrating that pigeon behavior varies with urbanization, human activity, and ecological attributes. Since behavioral changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes. Overall this research demonstrates that urban landscape heterogeneity may contribute to variable spatial genetic and behavioral responses across a single city, therefore researchers must examine patters at different spatial scales. Moreover, organisms such as pigeons that depend on humans, exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure that reflects human patterns and distributions, stressing the importance of sampling across urban areas.

TI  - Urban landscape relationships with song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population structure and connectivity and human health and behavior
AU  - Unfried, Thomas Mitchell
AB  - Urbanization converts native vegetation to novel land cover types, which may affect population connectivity. I studied this relationship in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at 18 sites in the Seattle, WA, metropolitan region. Genetic differentiation was best predicted by resistance distances in which resistance to dispersal was linearly related to age of development and a second set of resistance distances in which high and medium urbanization were 100 times more resistant than vegetation land covers. My results suggest that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. The relation to development age suggests that genetic differentiation in the urban system has not yet reached equilibrium, so the effects of connectivity loss will increase.
Urbanization can decrease habitat quality that can result in source-sink population dynamics I combined a study of demographic rates with genetic methods to study source-sink population dynamics in Song Sparrows. I estimated juvenile and adult survival from mark-recapture analysis and fecundity from territory success and fledgling counts. Directional gene flow was investigated by several genetic methods. The trend in Song Sparrow relative abundance revealed an intrinsic rate of increase of −7.8% annually, and four of 15 sampled populations had finite rates of increase (λ) significantly less than one. Net immigration estimated from genetic assignments was negatively correlated with λ. Net immigration or λ were not correlated with landscape or local habitat metrics. Genetic methods suggest that gene flow is common throughout the region, and Song Sparrows exhibit source-sink population dynamics.
I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team to examine the influence of destinations within walking distance and vegetation on walking trips and body mass index (BMI) for residents of Seattle, WA. We measured accessibility and greenness, and self-reported destinations, natural features, walking trips, BMI were measured through a postal survey. Objective accessibility was related to walking trips per month, as was subjective greenness. In areas with high accessibility, BMI was lower in areas that had more greenness. Objective and subjective measurements of accessibility and greenness led to an understanding of variation among walking trips and BMI in different neighborhoods.

TI  - The effect of urbanisation on plant diversity: Comparative case studies in Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria
AU  - Terziyski, Georgi Dimitrov
AB  - In the last few decades the importance of urban green space in terms of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development has been widely recognised. The planning decisions about urban green space, however, have been based mostly on two factors. Green areas that are perceived as more natural are generally seen as more valuable than those, like playing fields, which are heavily managed. The second factor is the degree of isolation; green spaces, which link together to form 'green corridors', are expected to be more valuable. One might also expect green spaces located within less built-up residential areas to be of higher quality than those within dense housing. This study investigated the relative importance of three factors on the plant diversity of urban green spaces in two case study areas: Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria. These were the position of the green spaces relative to housing of different densities; the type of green spaces, and level of management to which they had been subjected; and the effects of the size of the green space and whether they were connected to others. First, three residential morphology types (high, medium and low density) were delineated from maps and high-quality aerial photographs using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software. The interpretation of aerial photographs showed that high density housing covers 18.0%, medium density 60% and low density 22% of the overall residential areas in Bolton. In Sofia the largest proportion was made up of low density housing (46%), followed by medium density (43%) and high density (11%). A set of 24 sampling plots positioned within the residential green spaces were selected in each of the case study areas. The focus of the study was the herbaceous component of grasslands. The four studied green space types were: parks and recreational gardens, playing fields (in Sofia substituted by roadside verges), derelict areas, and remnants of semi-natural vegetation. These green spaces could be grouped into two categories of management: managed and unmanaged. Overall 174 species of herbaceous angiosperms were identified in Bolton and 246 in Sofia. There were significant differences between the mean species numbers identified in the three housing densities in both case study areas. Least species rich were the green spaces within the high density residential areas. Most species were found in the medium density in Bolton and within the low density in Sofia. There were also differences between the types of green spaces. The most species were found in semi-natural remnants of vegetation and derelict areas. The managed green spaces were less species rich compared with unmanaged ones in both case study areas. A positive correlation was observed between the size of the green space and number of species in Bolton, but in Sofia, the lack of aerial photographs made this test impossible. The connectivity between the green spaces did not, however, correlate with their species richness. In conclusion, these results suggest that the size, management method, type and position within particular residential type are the important factors which determine plant diversity in urban areas. Connectivity between green spaces does not seem to affect diversity. Therefore, the negative effects of urbanisation may best be mitigated by better management of existing urban green space. The results also suggest, albeit tentatively, that the concept of the green corridor may not be that important for maintaining urban plant diversity. Further studies will continue to determine the effect of patch size and isolation on plant diversity.

AB  - Habitat alteration has been identified as one of the major causes of amphibian decline. In this study, the genetic structure of seven fire salamander subpopulations in the urbanized area of Salzburg (Austria) was investigated based on seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. We combined Bayesian clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, TESS) with the traditional F-statistics to evaluate the effect of potential barriers on gene flow. Both clustering approaches suggested that all sampled individuals belong to a single genetic pool (K = 1). While no clear-cut sign of genetic differentiation could be detected, pairwise FST-values suggest that the city of Salzburg potentially has an effect, but the effect of the highway leading to it remains hypothetical. This study corroborates that habitat alteration effects might take several generations before leading to isolated genetic pools, particularly in long-lived species. Such delayed effects have to be taken into account for population genetic analyses, in particular when it comes to conservation management and planning.

TI  - Wildlife Connectivity Modeling for the Northern Red-legged Frog in the Portland Metropolitan Area, Oregon
AU  - Temple, Amanda Hilary
AB  - Effective habitat connectivity tools that use GIS data perform well in remote areas but may not be as dependable in urban environments. My goal was to study uses and limitations of a conservation management tool in development, the Metro Regional Habitat Connectivity Toolkit, which evaluates connectivity for and permeability of wildlife movement. Habitat quality scores are generated from GIS-derived and field collected data such as connectivity patch/matrix characteristics, water source, vegetation, other structural components, wildlife observations, and human disturbance at survey sites. I compared GIS and field generated habitat quality scores for the Northern Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora) in urbanizing Gresham East Buttes, Oregon. Using Spearman’s ranked correlation, there was low positive correlation between GIS and field scores indicating the two scores assess different types of data. The magnitude of difference between these scores had no interdependence along a development gradient. Assessment of Northern Red-legged Frog locations in Forest Park, resulted in habitat quality scores which were sensitive to the presence or visibility of water sources and other structural components such as woody debris. These findings indicate the need for repeat field surveys, and the importance of field-collected data’s unique contributions which ensure crucial wildlife dispersal is protected in rapidly changing environments. To give regional conservation managers confidence in applying connectivity tools in urbanizing environments, I compared a predictive Circuitscape connectivity model to additional field collected data such as habitat quality, and distance between aquatic-terrestrial habitats using aquatic egg mass surveys for Northern Red-legged Frog. Further genetic and demographic studies are recommended to fully discern the implications of these findings and to protect this Oregon state strategy species that utilizes at-risk aquatic and terrestrial connections during its annual migrations.

AB  - We employed an island biogeographic approach to determine whether small fragments of the shrub habitats coastal sage scrub and chaparral, isolated by urbanization, are capable of supporting viable populations of native rodent species. The distribution of native rodents in 25 urban habitat fragments was assessed by live-trapping. Over half of the fragments surveyed (13 of 25) did not support populations of native rodents. Fragments supported fewer species than equivalently sized plots in large expanses of unfragmented habitat, and older fragments (fragments that had been isolated for a longer period of time) supported fewer species. Both results implied that local extinctions occurred in the fragments following insularization. Stepwise multiple polychotomous logistic regression was used to determine which biogeographic variables were the best predictors of species number across fragments. The area of shrub habitat in each fragment was the most significant predictor of species diversity; age of a fragment was also significant and was negatively correlated with species number, but the isolation distance of a fragment had no relationship to species diversity. We found a negative relationship between extinction vulnerability of native rodent species and relative abundance: species that were more abundant in unfragmented habitat persisted in more habitat fragments. Random environmental and demographic fluctuations (island effects) and edge effects associated with fragmentation are proposed as causes of these local extinctions.

TI  - Spatial Population Genomics and Landscape Ecology of Urban Brown Rats (Rattus norvegicus)
AU  - Combs, Matthew Aaron
AB  - Spatial patterns of genetic variation provide a lens into the ecological and evolutionary responses of wildlife populations to landscape heterogeneity, though our understanding of urban landscapes remains limited. Further, it remains unclear whether species exhibit parallel responses to independent landscapes. Commensal rodents are widely distributed within cities and around the world, offering a useful model for understanding the influence of cities on gene flow, genetic drift, and habitat distribution. Here I study the population genetics and landscape ecology of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in four urban landscapes, New York City (NYC), New Orleans (NOL), Salvador (SAL), Vancouver (VAN), using genome-wide SNPs to understand the influence of urban landscapes on eco-evolutionary processes governing their distribution and functional connectivity.
Rat populations in each city exhibited significant genetic discontinuities that coincide with landscape features, despite widespread isolation-by-distance processes. Genetic variation in NYC and SAL rats was clinal, but I identified genetic clusters separated by areas with lower genetic diversity and reduced migration. Rats in NOL and SAL exhibited stark genetic structure that coincided with a canal and major roadways, respectively. I identified spatially restricted dispersal in all populations leading to parallel decays in spatial autocorrelation with increased distance. Habitat suitability modeling revealed a consistent response of rat distribution to human population density, income, and building characteristics. Landscape genetic modeling indicated that models incorporating features of the built physical environment consistently predict gene flow processes, though unique landscape effects were identified in each city, particularly at local spatial scales. Further, I found that habitat suitability and genetic connectivity were uncoupled (i.e., driven by different factors) and habitat is rarely the best predictor of gene flow for urban rats. My results demonstrate the utility of multi-landscape studies in identifying generalized trends across populations, with implications for the management of invasive pest populations. Ultimately, this dissertation improves our understanding of the influence of urban landscapes on neutral evolutionary processes in widely distributed species and the ecology of commensal rodents.

AB  - Based on GIS and CBERS/CCD which was obtained on June 16, 2006, patches of urban green in the main urban areas of Chengdu are extracted using many quantitative indicators and by method of decision tree classification, according to principles and methods of landscape ecology. Patches of urban green are divided into four grades, and they are respectively small-scale patch, medium-scale patch, large-scale patch and special large-scale patch. The area proportion of small-scale patch is 3.8%, and that of medium-scale patch is 11.1%, that of large-scale patch is 22.3% and that of special large-scale patch is 62.8%.The results of fragmentation, contagion, diversity index, dominance and evenness are obtained. They are 0.854, 0.600, 0.657, 0.730 and 0.690 respectively. The research results think that scalability characteristics and divisional differences of green patches are obvious. A little number of green whose area is bigger mainly is composed of scenic spots, gardens and universities. There are many problems, for example, connectivity of urban green is low, structure of landscape is single, and spatial distribution is unbalanced. So, the government should attach importance to greening and management of urban and rural transitional zone which is being developed now.

TI  - Spider and Beetle Communities Across Urban Greenspaces in Cleveland, Ohio: Distributions, Patterns, and Processes
AU  - Delgado de la flor, Yvan A.
AB  - Urban areas are often considered adverse environments for wildlife communities given that the colonization and establishment of local species pools are disrupted by biotic and abiotic changes at different spatial scales such as the introduction of invasive species, periodic mowing, and changes in soil and air quality. Although the number of people residing in cities has increased in the last century, over 300 cities worldwide have shrunk due to prolonged economic decline and population loss, resulting in thousands of newly available greenspaces scattered throughout cities. Consequently, interest in urban greenspaces as sites for conservation has grown considerably, raising questions about the ability of these habitats to support wildlife. As novel ecosystems, urban areas represent a set of new challenges for local species pools, yet the mechanisms driving community assembly processes within cities is a major knowledge gap. My work focused on identifying species distributions, patterns, and processes leading to the successful establishment arthropods in cities. For this, I chose to work with beetle and spider assemblages as they are considered biological indicators of environmental changes at small and large spatial scales and are taxonomically and functionally diverse predatory groups.
In Chapter 1, my objective was to determine how urban greenspaces management and design impacts Carabidae and Staphylinidae beetles using taxonomic and life-history trait approaches. I found that ecological and morphological traits were good indicators of how beetles were responding to greenspace management strategies. Most species were negatively associated with building structures, while undisturbed habitats supported more hygrophilous and brachypterous beetle populations.
In Chapter 2, I investigated the importance of local and landscape characteristics on spider communities using taxonomic and functional diversity approaches. I found that Pardosa milvina (Lycosidae) was the most abundant spider in our system. Plant height favored larger species, while mowing frequency benefited small spiders, leading to lower than expected functional alpha and beta diversity of spider communities. I also found that patch isolation and impervious surface increased the functional dissimilarity of spider communities.
In Chapter 3, I examined the dietary niche breadth and niche overlap of the generalist spider P. milvina using DNA gut-content analysis. I found that dietary niche breadth was not greater within urban pockets, and Diptera, Hemiptera, and Collembola were often preyed by this urban-adapted spider. I also found that P. milvina predation patterns were driven by foraging strategies, suggesting that taxonomic identify and nutritional content were more important than prey availability.
In Chapter 4, my goal was to determine the habitat characteristics and landscape variables influencing spider functional groups directly and indirectly. Using structural equation modeling, I found that web spiders were negatively correlated with plant biomass, hunting spiders were positively associated with available prey breadth, and both spider functional groups were positively correlated with heavy-metal pollution in the soil.
In summary, my work showed that urban greenspace management and design play important roles shaping beetle and spider communities within cities. I also highlighted the importance of using multi-trophic and molecular approaches coupled with multivariate methodologies to disentangle local food web interactions and elucidate the mechanisms shaping community assembly processes of urban species pools. Investments in managed greenspaces that require infrequent mowing (i.e. urban prairies) will enhance the populations of beneficial arthropods, such as spiders and beetles, and beautify local neighborhoods.

TI  - Ecology of coyotes (Canis latrans) in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan
AU  - Dodge, William B.
AB  - Coyote distribution and habitat use, diet and foraging behavior, and space use patterns were investigated in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan. We found evidence of coyotes on 24 of 30 (80%) suburban and 7 of 11 (64%) urban plots. Overall fifty-eight percent of coyote evidence was found within edge habitats, with den sites and tracks the only types of evidence found strictly in interior habitats. Land cover around evidence points included more wooded land cover than expected in suburban areas, suggesting the importance of tree cover for coyote occupancy, and more open space and wooded land cover than expected in urban areas, highlighting their avoidance of heavily populated areas. Coyote diet was assessed through identification of remains of food items recovered in coyote scat. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and small rodents were the most consumed prey in both urban and suburban areas. Coyote consumption of white-tailed deer biomass was 7.2% greater than expected in suburban areas and 10.0% less than expected in urban areas and the difference was significant (P < 0.004). More white-tailed deer, raccoon, and woodchuck biomass was consumed compared to other studies, likely due to high use of road-kill. In suburban areas, coyote selection for road-killed white-tailed deer was positive regardless of white-tailed deer or rabbit abundance. Coyotes in urban areas used a foraging strategy that incorporated both prey selection and switching, with no strong discernable pattern. Radio-telemetry technology was used to gather relocations of coyotes for analysis of home range and cores areas frequented by coyotes. Smaller home ranges were made up of greater proportions of urban land than natural land cover, although there was variation. Core areas were dominated by relatively large patches of natural land cover and had greater connectivity compared to home range areas. Radio-telemetry data suggested that coyotes were selective in their use of space, avoiding urban land in favor of natural land cover.

AB  - Despite the intense challenges to wildlife presented by urbanization, many species continue to survive and even to thrive in these highly impacted landscapes. In the urban matrix of Denver, Colorado, USA, two snake species persist in restricted urban habitats near the limit of their geographic ranges: the Western Terrestrial Gartersnake (Thamnophis elegans) and the Plains Gartersnake (Thamnophis radix). We used nuclear microsatellite markers to assess the population genetic structure of three populations of both species living syntopically in this highly developed urban environment and one population of T. elegans in natural habitat. Our findings indicate strong population structure, limited migration between populations of each species, and evidence of inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity, with these patterns more pronounced in T. radix. Additionally, we do not find evidence of increased hybridization between these species in such confined habitat patches. These results suggest that populations of long-lived vertebrate species may require intervention to escape long-term detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation and subsequent genetic isolation. © 2017.

TI  - Effects of fragmentation and urbanization on forest bird communities in the Region of Waterloo, 1990-1991
AU  - Friesen, Lyle Edgar
AB  - Forest bird communities in 41 urban and rural woodlots in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario were examined to assess the effects of fragmentation and urbanization on different classes of bird communities--neotropical migrants, short-distance migrants, and permanent residents--and to interpret the findings in terms of theories of ecological stress. The relationships between groups and individual species of forest birds and forest size, isolation of forest patches from other forests, urban-rural location, and vegetation structure were analyzed using stepwise regression.
The number of species and the abundance of individual species were higher in larger than in smaller forests, and in rural than in urban forests, because of the increased presence of neotropical migrants. Many neotropical species were absent or uncommon both in small forests and in urban forests (small and large), but usually were present in large rural forests. In contrast, the diversity and abundance of short-distance migrants and permanent residents remained constant in both small and large, and in urban and rural, forests.
Neotropical migrants account for at least 60 percent of all breeding individuals in extensive forest tracts. Measured against this standard, many forests in the Region of Waterloo, especially the urban ones, have suffered a significant loss of integrity.

TI  - Genetic Connectivity of Stream Salamanders in Urban, Suburban, and Rural Habitats
AU  - Fusco, Nicole A.
AB  - Ongoing human population growth and increased urban development around the world is inflicting new pressures and challenges for wildlife living within areas affected by urbanization. Habitat alteration can have severe consequences for native species that remain in previously undisturbed areas. Urban development has shown to reduce abundance and density of populations and create barriers to gene flow for stream salamanders in urban areas. Although they are still relatively common and abundant through the Northeast, Northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) populations are declining in urban habitats including in New York City. In this study, I explored genetic structure of E. bislineata across an urban, suburban and rural habitat to better understand how urbanization is affecting genetic connectivity between headwater streams. Next, I investigated what environmental and/or urban features influence gene flow patterns in E. bislineata across these same three habitats using landscape genetic methods. Lastly, I used environmental DNA monitoring with metabarcoding techniques to explore stream salamander presence on an urban-to-rural gradient and to investigate overall vertebrate species richness differences to further understand how urban development may be affecting biodiversity in urban aquatic ecosystems.
E. bislineata within the urban habitat had greater genetic structure, yet exhibited comparable genetic diversity levels to individuals in the suburban and rural habitat. A mixture of terrestrial variables influence gene flow in the urban habitat, percent canopy cover is most influential for gene flow in the suburban habitat, and variation in aquatic variables affects gene flow patterns for rural stream salamanders. Urbanization factors were identified as the second most important features affecting genetic variation for salamanders in the suburban and urban habitats. Finally, using eDNA from stream water, I found that E. bislineata is present in streams across a gradient of urban development, while another common stream salamander species, Desmognathus fuscus was only detected in more non-urban habitats. With this method, I also detected differences in species composition in urban versus non-urban habitats, mostly due to more non-native species eDNA detected in more urbanized streams. This dissertation provides further understanding of how urbanization affects the evolution of a native amphibian species and how urban development affects stream salamander distribution in the NYC metropolitan area. This information will inform conservation efforts and urban planning in cities that want to promote longevity of populations of this indicator species in our urban ecosystems.

TI  - Comparative Population Genomics of Native (Sundamys Muelleri) and Invasive (Rattus Rattus) Rodents Along an Urbanization Gradient in Borneo
AU  - Herrera, Giselle Agatha
AB  - Urbanization continues to be one of the most significant processes of global change modifying the environment rapidly and permanently. With increases in infrastructure and human settlement, natural areas become fragmented, and small populations in these patches become more vulnerable to genetic drift and are unable to disperse due to barriers to gene flow. Often these pervasive alterations to the environment result in the introduction of exotic species that can thrive in urban habitats with anthropogenically made available resources. Both native and nonnative wildlife that inhabit cities and nearby non-urban areas serve as ideal models to show how populations are evolving in response to developmental pressures. While native rodents in urban areas exhibit patterns of low genetic diversity and genetic connectivity, populations of invasive rodents reveal high connectivity and gene flow. Studying the evolutionary implications of this ecological change, particularly in understudied regions of rapid development like in biodiverse rich areas of Southeast Asia, will be vital to understand the variation of species responses to urbanization. In this study, I explored genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of populations of the native Müller's giant Sunda rat (Sundamys muelleri) and invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) across an urbanization gradient on the island on Borneo. Sundamys muelleri exhibited decreased genetic diversity in urban areas and was differentiated from rural and suburban locations. Populations of S. muelleri also displayed low genetic connectivity with urbanization posing a potential barrier to gene flow. Rattus rattus exhibited decreased genetic diversity in rural areas and a clinal genetic structure across the urbanization gradient. Populations of R. rattus also displayed high genetic connectivity, but development likely still prevents dispersal opportunities. This research provides useful information on how urbanization evolutionarily affects these two species of rodents (a native and invasive) and how development impacts population structure and connectivity. This information will provide useful for the conservation of endemic species in Borneo, to better understand the population genetics of these vector species and inform pest management across the urbanization gradient.

TI  - Eco-Evolutionary Implications of Environmental Change Across Heterogeneous Landscapes
AU  - Homola, Jared J.
AB  - Species use a variety of mechanisms to adapt to environmental change. These range from spatially tracking optimal environments, to phenotypically plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation. Due to increases in anthropogenic influence on environments, characteristics of change such as their duration and magnitude are undergoing fundamental shifts away from the natural disturbance regimes that shaped species’ evolution. This dissertation uses empirical data and simulation models to examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change across real, heterogeneous landscapes for multiple species, with an emphasis on anthropogenic changes. I used landscape genetics to evaluate the effects of urbanization on two native amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Population isolation was positively associated with local urbanization and lessened genetic diversity for both species. Resistance surface modelling revealed connectivity was diminished by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic landscape features relative to natural features. Further study of a subset of wood frog populations revealed adaptive evolution associated with urban environments. I identified a set of 37 loci with the capacity to correctly reassign individuals into rural or urban populations with 87.5 and 93.8% accuracy, respectively. I developed an agent-based model to examine how gene flow, rates of change, and strength of landscape spatial and temporal autocorrelation influence abundance outcomes for species experiencing an environmental shift. Analysis of 36 environmental scenarios suggests that environmental variation, which is an emergent property of landscape autocorrelation, is negatively associated with the magnitude and duration of abundance declines following environmental change. Higher levels of gene flow lessened this effect, particularly in abrupt change scenarios, although gradual changes also resulted in demographic costs. Lastly, I used an investigation of an emerging disease in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) to study within-generation responses to environmental pressures. Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing I identified eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the disease and seven related to environmental differences. Collectively, my dissertation provides numerous examples of how anthropogenically induced environmental change can direct ecological and evolutionary processes.

TI  - Matrix effects on individual and community-level responses of birds to forest fragmentation in Jamaica
AU  - Kennedy, Christina Marie
AB  - Land cover between habitat patches (“matrix”) can impact species persistence in fragmented landscapes by altering resource availability, edge effects, or inter-patch movement. This thesis examines how the matrix affects the Neotropical bird community in central Jamaica in landscapes where forest is embedded in three human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) and one natural “matrix” (continuous forest).
First, I examine whether richness, community composition, and abundances of resident birds differ in ∼ 100 forest patches within the four matrix types, and relate species responses to traits influencing dispersal, resource acquisition, and/or population growth. Agricultural landscapes were found to retain avian diversity and community assemblages most similar to intact forest relative to peri-urban and bauxite landscapes. Traits related to resource acquisition best predicted species responses, indicating that resource limitation driven by the matrix may be a primary factor driving bird responses to fragmentation.
Next, I determine the relative influence of patch area, isolation, vegetation structure, and matrix type on the occupancy dynamics of resident insectivorous birds. Within-patch vegetation and matrix type were the most important determinants of colonization and extinction, but the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation on occupancy dynamics were matrix- and species-dependent. Across the community, the matrix influenced extinction probabilities more than colonization, indicating that extinction processes likely drive population dynamics.
Finally, I examine the relative permeability of peri-urban, bauxite, and forested landscapes on the movement of the migrant American Redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla) and the resident Jamaican Tody (Todus todus) by experimentally translocating > 140 birds 0.6–4 km from their territories across landscape treatments. Redstarts returned with greater success and faster speed than Todies. Return success was not impacted by landscape treatment, but both species returned more rapidly in forest relative to bauxite matrix, with return times intermediate in a peri-urban matrix. These findings indicate that bird mobility in fragmented landscapes is mediated by the landscape matrix.
This research is among few empirical studies to discern the impacts of different matrix types on species patterns and processes. These results inform theory on fragmentation as well as bird conservation in an understudied system.

TI  - The Effects of Urbanization on Riparian Forest Plant Communities in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina
AU  - Lopez, Bianca E.
AB  - Ongoing urban development is having profound impacts on ecosystems worldwide, by reducing the amount and connectivity of natural habitat and changing the local environmental conditions. Despite the ubiquity and the continued growth of urban areas, the effects of urban development on the diversity and composition of plant communities remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I address this issue by investigating the effects of urban development on patches of remnant riparian forest in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. To do this, I used a rural-to-urban gradient approach, comparing the plant species and environmental conditions of sites surrounded by different amounts of urban development. I first explored the effects of different “filters” created by urban development on plant biodiversity using structural equation modeling. In this, I tested the predictions of an established conceptual framework and developed a general model that could be used to compare the effects of urbanization on plant biodiversity across cities. I then examined changes in plant species’ functional traits along the rural-to-urban gradient and compared the species and traits found at these sites to high-quality riparian plant communities that represent potential targets for restoration. I found that plant traits change somewhat predictably along an urbanization gradient, particularly with regard to species’ seed dispersal modes, but that traits may not be as useful for predicting which species will establish in urban restoration efforts. Finally, I assessed the ability of environmental variables and spatial variables describing habitat connectivity to explain variation in plant species composition across sites. I found that species with limited dispersal ability showed the strongest signal of dispersal limitation across sites, and that urban development between sites appears to reduce connectivity for these species. This dissertation provides insight into the ways that urban development is altering riparian forests in the Research Triangle, which may have important impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. My results have implications for land management, restoration, and urban planning in this landscape.

AB  - La superficie en tant que composante de la fragmentation de l’habitat : corroboration de son rôle dans les peuplements et guildes d’oiseaux nicheurs dans les chênaies fragmentées d’Italie centrale. — Nous voulons vérifier l’influence de la superficie des fragments forestiers et des autres variables (paramètres d’isolement et de la structure de la végétation) sur la richesse spécifique ainsi que sur la composition de la communauté avienne nicheuse et des guildes dans un archipel de 20 îlots de forêts de chênes au sein d’une matrice agricole/ urbaine proche de Rome (Italie centrale). Au niveau de la communauté, les analyses de corrélation simple, multiple et PCA, montrent que la superficie des fragments est le principal «prédicteur» de la richesse spécifique et de l’indice de diversité. Dans la classe des superficies de 10-100 ha, la richesse spécifique et l’indice de diversité tendent vers des valeurs cumulatives. Au niveau des guildes, les espèces de l’intérieur des forêts sont absentes dans les fragments dont la superficie est inférieure à 10 ha. En accord avec d’autres auteurs, 10 ha pourrait être la superficie-seuil contribuant à prédire l’abondance de ces espèces. Les espèces de lisière diminuent et les espèces d’intérieur augmentent en abondance dans les plus grands fragments (superficie > 50 ha). La pente des courbes aire/ espèces (et la valeur z) est plus élevée sans considérer la composante des espèces de lisière. Ces espèces, généralistes et/ou qui vivent dans les habitats qui entourent les fragments, peuvent masquer l’ «effet île» sur la communauté avienne des habitats boisés résiduels.

            We assessed the influence of size area and other variables (isolation and vegetation structure) on the species richness and composition of breeding bird communities and guilds in an archipelago of 20 oak wood fragments embedded in an agricultural/ urban matrix near Rome (Central Italy). At community level, simple and multiple correlation and PCA analysis showed that fragment size was the main predictor of species richness and diversity index. In the range size 10-100 ha, values of species richness and diversity index tended to cumulative values. At guild level, interior species were absent in fragments smaller than 10 ha. In accordance with other authors, 10 ha could be a fragment size threshold that contributes to predict the abundance of these species. Edge species decreased and interior species increased their abundance in larger fragments (> 50 ha in size). Slope of area/species curves (and z value) is higher not considering the edge species component. These species, generalist and/or inhabiting the surrounding habitats, may confound the “ island effect” on bird communities of wood habitat remnants.

TI  - Habitat interactions structuring songbird communities across forest -urban edges
AU  - MacDonald-Beyers, Kristi
AB  - Urban habitats vary greatly in the resources they provide for birds and other wildlife. Few species entirely avoid either human or forest habitats and for species that regularly utilize both, the two habitat types (forest and urban) may interact in complex ways to shape the animal communities at the forest-urban ecotone. I studied habitat relations to songbird community structure across the urban-forest edge in a heavily urbanized watershed in the New York metropolitan region. My research was designed to provide specific knowledge about the natural and human-built habitat components that maintain avian richness and abundance. I found that mature, intact forests with large trees and greater vertical complexity were the most valuable to birds breeding in and migrating through urban forests. Also, shrubby habitats along forest edges bolstered bird richness because they provide habitat for specialized shrub-nesting species. In my study, urban forests of a broad range of sizes and habitat conditions were associated with increased bird diversity in adjacent human habitats up to at least 0.2 Km from their edges. A high density of large trees in the urban matrix was related to increased avian richness outside the forest in urban neighborhoods. Also, a high density of large trees in the urban matrix was associated with higher richness and abundance of breeding and migrating birds inside adjacent forests. Because residential areas have the highest density as well as variety of large trees relative to other types of urban land use, they also contain the greatest richness of birds.
This study demonstrates that local habitat is very important in structuring the bird community both inside forests as well as in the urban matrix but adjacent habitat also affects bird community structure. Forest area and isolation are relatively unimportant in shaping bird communities at the forest-urban ecotone. These findings suggest a wide-range of conservation practices, including forest preservation, management of shrubby edges, and planting and caring for a variety of long-lived trees in urban neighborhoods, that would maintain a rich bird community in urban regions.

TI  - The persistence of prairie dogs within urban habitat islands in the Colorado Front Range
AU  - Magle, Seth B.
AB  - I investigated the ecology of black-tailed prairie dogs in fragmented urban habitat in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. My study area consisted of 387 habitat fragments, 54 of which were colonized by prairie dogs. These fragments were highly isolated and surrounded by roads and development, and my studies represent the first studies of prairie dogs in highly urban environments.
I evaluate the interactions between urban prairie dogs and vegetation and find that prairie dogs in urban areas tend to be present on sites with high grass coverage, though the grass layer is reduced in the immediate vicinity of the colonies. Prairie dogs interact with vegetation similarly in urban areas and natural habitat, providing evidence that the ecological role of prairie dogs as keystone species may be partly retained in human-dominated landscapes.
I provide the first study using mark-resight methodology to evaluate the local population density of prairie dogs, and find it more accurate than traditional methods of burrow counts or visual indices. I observed extremely high densities for prairie dogs in urban settings, probably because of a fence effect where animals are restricted to available habitat due to the difficulty of dispersal in an urban environment.
I compare connectivity metrics to determine which have the best predictive power for the occurrence of colonies in this area, and find that complex methods incorporating area of patches and cost-weighted distance surfaces perform best. In general, inclusion of biological information improves the ability of metrics to predict wildlife distribution. This study provides a rare opportunity to compare the performance of connectivity metrics using empirical data on wildlife distribution and will be of benefit to future spatial and landscape analyses.
Finally, I evaluate a series of landscape and local variables to determine which have the most importance to the distribution of prairie dogs across our study system. Fragment area and local variables such as litter coverage have the most explanatory power, but all tested metrics had importance to prairie dog occurrence. My results can be used to target potential habitat for prairie dog conservation and to inform future research on wildlife in urban areas.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, infrastructure, land use changes and other developments must be considered on a landscape and regional scale. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity on a landscape scale, and for evaluating the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity on forest bird diversity in an urban-rural gradient. The purpose of the analyses was to develop knowledge and methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and assessments in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional scales.

AB  - Management of wildlife in habitats fragmented by urbanisation requires an understanding of a species’ habitat use. Known populations of the critically endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) are largely restricted to bushland remnants in rapidly urbanising areas of south-western Australia. Habitat use is thought to be driven by nutritional content, structure and connectivity of canopy vegetation. At the southernmost extent of the species’ range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88 ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover; used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys); and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night. These results confirm that differences in habitat use among populations exist and suggests that the species is reasonably flexible in its use of habitat. Management of western ringtail possums needs to be population specific and will benefit from further examination of habitat use in the variety of occupied habitats.

While it is clear that avian assemblages are adversely affected by unsuitable habitat in such situations, there is less known about which aspects of this type of development are the important ones affecting birds. In order to explore anthropogenic impacts on birds influenced by cities, I monitored bird diversity at 25 woodlot study sites in and around Fort Wayne, Indiana, over the course of a breeding season. Point counts were conducted in each site and visited 3 times to obtain a species richness list. Study sites were characterized by area, the area to perimeter ratio, percent canopy cover, and mid- and overstory vegetation. The identity, number, and size of the vegetation was measured. The landscape matrix around the sites was characterized by distance to woodlots larger than the site itself, and distance to rivers, lakes/ponds, and wetlands. To obtain measurements of the urban matrix, the densities of habitable structures, distances of roads, and volume of vehicle traffic were measured in 5 concentric buffers ranging from 100 m to 3 km distance from the site.
After removing collinear factors with variance inflation factors > 5, within each buffer size multiple linear regressions were chosen on the basis of best subsets analyses with all significant predictors. The models were ranked with Akaike Information Criterion with correction.
Log transformed site area appeared in every model and had the largest positive effect on woodland bird richness. Greater mean area of an individual stem and distance to rivers were also positive predictors of richness in the 300 m buffer model. The densities roads, buildings, and vehicles adversely affected richness. Roads adversely affected richness in the 100 m buffer model. The effect of buildings extended to 300 m and had the largest negative impact, while vehicles appeared in the 300 m and 3000 m buffer models. The effect of vehicles, likely an indication of the degree of site isolation, was present out to 3 km demonstrating that urban and suburban development influences deciduous woodlot birds in a large radius around the site.
The results from my study reinforce the findings from other researchers that site area is a very important factor for predicting bird diversity. Consequently, maintaining suitable habitat in patches of substantial size is the best way to aid birds. While of less importance but still of significance, forests with larger trees, associated with a forest’s age, should be maintained. The ramification of this is that forests must be left alone without removal of the larger trees in order to best provide for birds. Building development should be kept to at least 300 m from these patches as a greater density of habitable buildings nearer than this distance significantly caused a decrease in the bird richness. With these things in mind, site preservation for birds should focus on large mature sites surrounded by the least amount of urban development.

TI  - The Role of Spatial Heterogeneity and Urban Pattern in Modulating Ecosystem Services
AU  - Shoemaker, Douglas Allen
AB  - The shift of global populations to cities heralds a new epoch marked by human impact, the Anthropocene, and with it radical changes to the biosphere. Some of the most significant change has occurred in developing countries, where amenity migration to rural areas within commuting distance of expanding urban centers has fundamentally restructured the configuration, hydrology and ecologies of surrounding watersheds. The export of urbanization to the countryside is manifested by rapid conversions of greenfields to impervious covers designed for human use, conversions that have consumed and fragmented networks of green infrastructure supporting growing populations. While the benefits of urbanization to human populations have been substantial, the ability of novel and evolving landscapes to sustain the production of environmental services, such as the ability to purify water, sequester climate-changing carbon, and harbor biodiversity, is poorly understood and historically shown to be compromised. The pace of urbanization, and particularly the combinatorial effects of climate change and development-caused hydrological alteration, has made the task of managing landscapes for human well-being increasingly difficult. Given the persistence of land change drivers such as urban population growth, there is a critical need to describe the trajectory of land cover change using both theory and projection, and anticipate impacts associated with urban form in order to proactively respond to environmental vulnerabilities.
A socio-ecological systems approach to the challenge of sustainable environmental provisioning has facilitated efforts to understand the dynamics of co-evolving human and environmental systems. However, a lack of concise theory regarding urban pattern and process, and the paucity of representative case study, has left the role of spatial structure in modulating ecosystem function largely unexplored. To overcome some of these challenges, I describe a series of three related studies where I used a novel integration of land change and ecosystem services simulations in order to map and measure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in transitioning socio-ecological landscapes (SEL), and generate ecosystemscale cause and effect data. In the first study I used this data to estimate the costs of waterborne non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration, and land cover based revenues for a rapidly urbanizing model system over a 24 year period. I also compared the effect associated with alternative patterns of urban growth, contrasting sprawl, infill and de-regulated scenarios with business as usual trends to gauge the effectiveness of environmental planning paradigms, such as “smart growth”. In the second, I tested the capacity a leading theory to explain the role of spatial heterogeneity in modulating ecosystem function in urban systems, to induce the integrated simulation results. Using structural equation modeling to translate the conceptualizations of Alberti (2005) into testable hypotheses, I tested for direct, indirect and modulating effects of landscape composition, connectivity, form, and land use intensity on the production of NPSP and carbon storage. In the third I examined land cover projection data for the presence of patterns suggesting that landscapes evolved in predictable ways. Using a dynamic proxy to bridge human and environmental effect, I tracked the evolution of connectivity in urbanizing watersheds by holding magnitude of change constant for three pattern alternative, and analyzing spatial configuration using distance-based, structural and circuit-based methods. These methods represent a move to predictive, rather than reactive, analytical paradigm, and allow us to move beyond the focus of managing current problems. They emphasize the utility of integrated urban growth-ecosystem service analyses in order to anticipate environmental trade-offs likely required by society. My findings emphasize the need for ecosystem service analyses to more adequately understand development tradeoffs in the metropolitan context. We conclude that not all urban growth impacts environments evenly, and that by controlling the compositional mix, configuration and connectedness, not just the amount of development, we can influence more benign environmental outcomes. To reduce environmental impacts regionally, planners are advised to manage amplifying effects of development by maintaining land cover diversity, and limiting the connectivity of developed land covers along hydrological gradients.

TI  - The Impact of Urban Forest Corridors on the Richness of Urban Bird Populations in Baltimore Forest Patches
AU  - Shobe, Beatriz Bridget Manon
AB  - Chapter one reviews what is known about animal movement patterns in an urban ecology context and how that knowledge is obtained. Several of the analytical programs used to assess movement are examined as well as strategies and technologies on gathering empirical movement data. Dominant paradigms used in understanding movement patterns across heterogenous urban habitat patches are also examined and evaluated. Chapter two then examines movement directly by assessing fragmented urban forested areas, including urban forested corridors, connected forested patches, and isolated forested patches. We attempt to assess connectivity from a species perspective and document the way in which species interact with heterogeneous urban landscape matrices. Urban corridors across Baltimore City are closely examined throughout the Summer of 2020. Using point counts and vegetation data, the effects of corridors on bird species richness are analyzed. I found that corridors contribute to urban biodiversity by providing habitat as well as mitigating the effects of nearby impervious surfaces associated with urban development.

AB  - Greenspaces and forest trees contribute to a number of environmental functions in urban environments, such as the survival of urban-dwelling species (e.g., bird species). This paper analyzes the relationship between greenspace characteristics (structural and spatial attributes) and the diversity of avian ecology species. This provides research findings coming from two studies conducted in Italy. Using point-count method, a quantification was done of the abundance and diversity of bird species in a number of greenspaces having different structural attributes (e.g., vegetation type, tree height) and spatial characteristics (e.g., location, connectivity). Results showed positive correlations between greenspaces with a more diverse and mature forest vegetation and the number of specimens and species observed in the two studies. A positive correlation appeared also between distance to the city centre and richness and abundance of bird species. Finally, we discuss some of the main implications for enhancing the functional attributes of greenspaces by using avian ecological indicators to inform ecologically sound urban planning and design.

TI  - Evaluating the Role of Area, Isolation, and Human Behavior on Meso-Mammals in a Small Statistical Demographic Area
AU  - Palode, Brittney
AB  - Urbanization offers unique challenges for wildlife. The urban landscape is fragmented and changes available resources for wildlife. Human-dominated landscapes can provide food, shelter, or cover through human-subsidized resources. However, to thrive in human-dominated landscapes, wildlife must adapt or disperse, otherwise they will die. In this study, I investigated how the urban landscape and human behavior influence urban wildlife occurrence. I established 35 camera sites during April 2020. I surveyed residential property dwellers around each camera site to determine what behavior they performed that could increase species occurrence. Gray fox and coyote site use decreased with increased isolation while no species responded to patch area. Almost all species investigated responded to attractants but not all showed a positive response. Although number of survey participants was small, site use by wildlife tended to increase with owning a bird feeder and putting out trash the day before pickup.

TI  - Effects of environmental factors on butterfly species in an urban setting
AU  - Niell, Lara E.
AB  - This study examined butterfly species richness and composition and their relationships to various landscape and habitat variables in undeveloped areas within an urban matrix in Reno, Nevada, USA. In 2006, we gathered data from 20 different undeveloped canyons within the city limits, we gathered data on butterfly species presence, vegetation, and host plant presence along with environmental variables such as isolation from other undeveloped sites, water presence, building density, and time since the site was surrounded by development.
We found that species composition across sites was nested, meaning that species compositions at sites with lower species richness were subsets of species found at sites with higher species richness. We also found that undeveloped area and presence of intermittent persistent water sources were positively correlated with species richness. Generalist species were positively associated with decreased isolation and increased edge, or perimeter to area ratio. Specialist species were negatively correlated with the presence of high use trails and increased amounts of herbaceous vegetation cover. Larval hostplants were not predictive of butterfly presence.
These correlations suggest that although composition across sites was nested, there was some noise to this nestedness. General composition can be approximated as species richness increases, but composition cannot be perfectly predicted because different variables affect composition at sites. This emphasizes the need to examine both species richness and composition when looking to preserve the natural integrity of an area. Undeveloped sites within the Reno urban matrix appeared to maintain a large portion of the expected butterfly species.

TI  - Impact of rapid urban expansion on structure, function and connectivity of green space.
AU  - Nor, Muhamad
AU  - Njihah, Amal
AB  - Globally, rapid urban expansion has caused a significant decline in green spaces in urban areas. It affects the form and structural patterns of green space. As a result, green space area becomes reduced in size, spatial structure, connectivity and function in urban areas. These gaps extend beyond uncoordinated master planning, which lacks required information regarding the past, present and future structural changes in urban expansion and green space. However, the existing methods and adaptive tools designed to respond to such needs are uncertain. This research aims to understand the impact of rapid urban expansions on the structure, connectivity and function of green spaces and to develop models as diagnostic and decision support tools in three Southeast Asian cities which are all areas of rapid expansion: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Metro Manila, Philippines. This study has evaluated the changes in the spatial structures and patterns of green space in urban areas of the three cities over the last two decades. The performance of the integrated Land Change Modeler (LCM) and the Markov chain modelling were verified to simulate future urban expansion by 2030. To reveal the priority corridors on maps, a novel integrated model which combines circuit theory, connectivity analysis and the least-cost path modelling, was used based on the target species of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and the Yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier). 
Overall, this study found that the percentage of green spaces in all three cities had reduced in size as the function of rapid urban expansions over the 25-year period. Key findings clearly indicated that important differences exist in spatial distributions of green space in different cities. LCM-Markov chain models proved to be suitable for the simulation of future land use/land cover (LULC). There were also important differences in the predicted spatial structure for 2030 when compared to the planned development in each city; substantive differences in the size, density, distance, shape and spatial pattern. The increased fragmentation of the landscape will continue in 2030, more shape complexity will be observed and less connectivity between green space patches will be present. Evidence suggests that these spatial patterns are influenced by the rapid urban expansion and respective master planning policies of the municipalities in the cities. This study identified that, the emergence of potential corridors by integrating structure and functional connectivity of green space could increase the connectivity of green space for conservational significant areas. Therefore, the use of integrated remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), landscape ecology 
analytics, simulation modelling and connectivity modelling tools provide significant insights into understanding the impact of rapid urban expansion on green space structure, identifies constraints and informs intervention for spatial planning and policies in cities, and contributes to the improvement of ecological networks in rapidly expanding cities.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on the behavior, distribution, and conservation of forest birds
AU  - Minor, Emily Stuart
AB  - Urbanization is occurring rapidly around the world, but ecologists are just beginning to realize the effects on birds and other wildlife. This dissertation has two major goals: (1) to document some of the effects of human development on bird distributions and movement in the North Carolina Piedmont, and (2) to test and develop graph theory as a tool that can be used for habitat assessment and conservation in fragmented habitats. These issues are critical to explaining and predicting bird occurrences in today's landscapes and are important for both basic ecological research and management.
The first portion of this dissertation uses empirical data collected from 272 point counts to quantify the effects of urbanization on forest songbirds. Initial results indicate that avian community composition varies across the study area with urban land cover and road density. However, an in-depth examination of the effects of roads on species abundance revealed that the importance of roads is simply an artifact of the vegetation and land cover changes that typically accompany them rather than a direct effect of the roads themselves. A final analysis of the field data considered the importance of roads and other land cover classes to bird movement in fragmented landscapes. Using alternative representations of bird dispersal behavior to predict species abundance, I showed that forest interior birds experience high dispersal cost through non-forest habitat but no cost of dispersing over roads.
The second portion of this dissertation presents graph theory as a tool for understanding bird movement, distribution, and conservation in fragmented landscapes. I compare the performance of graph theory to a more computationallyand data-intense spatially explicit population model (SEPM) in selecting important habitat patches for conservation, and show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in some cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM. In addition, I use graph theory to make inferences about movement, disturbance, and conservation strategies across the entire study area, concluding that the study area displays an intermediate level of connectivity and should be fairly resilient to development and disturbance.

              Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits

              and great tits
              Parus major
              moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

AB  - Abstract
          The negative effect of fragmentation is one of the main concerns in the study of biodiversity loss in landscape ecology. The use of the matrix has been considered an important factor because it can change the relationship of a population with the configuration of the landscape. A systematic way to assess the effect of matrix quality in fragmented landscapes could lead to a better understanding of how matrices can be used to suppress the negative effect of fragmentation. We built a computational individual-based model capable of simulating bi-dimensional landscapes with three types of land cover (habitat, suitable matrix and hostile matrix) and individuals that inhabit those landscapes. We explored in which situations changes in the proportion of the suitable matrix in the landscape and the degree of usability of this suitable matrix can mitigate the negative effect of fragmentation per se. We observed that (i) an increase in the matrix quality (increases in the suitable matrix proportion and/or usability) can suppress the fragmentation effect in 47% of the simulated scenarios; (ii) the less usable the matrix is the more of it is needed to suppress the fragmentation effect; (iii) there is a level of usability below which increasing the suitable matrix proportion does cause the fragmentation effect to cease. These results point toward a landscape management that considers the similarity of the matrix to the native habitat under management. We suggest that an index to measure the usability of elements of the matrix could be an important tool to further the use of computational models in landscape management.

AB  - Abstract
          Rapid urbanization and associated biodiversity loss is rampant globally but especially a cause of concern for developing countries. However, numerous studies investigating the role of urban green spaces have established their key role in conserving larger suites of species in urban area. Yet our knowledge is lopsided due to lag in research in developing countries. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season. This is the first study of this nature in one the Himalayan states of India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree richness at the local scale emerged as important predictor variables influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperiled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing much less management supported higher bird richness and density whereas city parks were the most species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the matrix and also by tree species richness within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on establishing larger city parks during design stage whereas biodiversity potential of the existing urban green spaces could be enhanced by selecting native tree and shrub species to increase overall habitat complexity.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Urbanisation is a major anthropogenic perturbation that progressively alters multiple environmental parameters, thereby presenting novel evolutionary challenges to wild populations. Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have well-established mutual connections with the physiology of their hosts and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impacts of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on gut microbiota remain poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the gut microbiota in juvenile great tits (
            Parus major
            ) in an urban mosaic. First, we compared the microbiota of nestlings reared in artificial nest boxes or natural cavities. Next, we analysed microbiota variations employing two distinct urbanisation frameworks, (i) the classical urban/rural dichotomy and (ii) gradual changes in the amount of impervious surface area (ISA) in the urban space and identified the environmental variables that predicted the changes in the microbial communities. Alpha diversity was influenced by cavity type and by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location. Alpha diversity was also positively correlated with the tree cover density. Beta diversity differed between urban and rural sites, and these alterations covaried with sound pollution, the distance to the city centre and the distance to the closest road. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework used to define the urban space can influence the outcomes of studies investigating animal-microbe symbiosis. Our results open new perspectives from which the potential function of microbial symbionts in the adaptation of their hosts to anthropogenic stress can be investigated.

AB  - Abstract
          
            The geographic nature of biological dispersal shapes patterns of genetic variation over landscapes, making it possible to infer properties of dispersal from genetic variation data. Here we present an inference tool that uses geographically distributed genotype data in combination with a convolutional neural network to estimate a critical population parameter: the mean per-generation dispersal distance. Using extensive simulation, we show that our deep learning approach is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly at small sample sizes. In addition, we evaluate varying nuisance parameters during training—including population density, demographic history, habitat size, and sampling area—and show that this strategy is effective for estimating dispersal distance when other model parameters are unknown. Whereas competing methods depend on information about local population density or accurate identification of identity-by-descent tracts, our method uses only single-nucleotide-polymorphism data and the spatial scale of sampling as input. Strikingly, and unlike other methods, our method does not use the geographic coordinates of the genotyped individuals. These features make our method, which we call “
            disperseNN
            ”, a potentially valuable new tool for estimating dispersal distance in non-model systems with whole genome data or reduced representation data. We apply
            disperseNN
            to 12 different species with publicly available data, yielding reasonable estimates for most species. Importantly, our method estimated consistently larger dispersal distances than mark-recapture calculations in the same species, which may be due to the limited geographic sampling area covered by some mark-recapture studies. Thus genetic tools like ours complement direct methods for improving our understanding of dispersal.

            Aim
            
              The impact of global change on biodiversity is commonly assessed in terms of changes in species distributions, community richness and community composition. Whether and how much associations between species,
              i.e
              . the degree of correlation in their spatial co-occurrence, are also changing is much less documented and mostly limited to local studies of ecological networks. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition.

            Methods
            We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1,969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of β-diversity and the proportion of habitat generalists. The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements.
          
          
            Results
            We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in β-diversity and in the proportion of generalists in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower β-diversity and a higher proportion of generalists, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes.
          
          
            Main Conclusions
            Although species association contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.

TI  - The comparative biogeography of Philippine geckos challenges predictions from a paradigm of climate-driven vicariant diversification across an island archipelago
AU  - Oaks, Jamie R.
AU  - Siler, Cameron D.
AU  - Brown, Rafe M.
AB  - Abstract
          A primary goal of biogeography is to understand how large-scale environmental processes, like climate change, affect diversification One often-invoked but seldom tested process is the “species-pump” model, in which repeated bouts of co-speciation are driven by oscillating climate-induced habitat connectivity cycles. For example, over the past three million years, the landscape of the Philippine Islands has repeatedly coalesced and fragmented due to sea-level changes associated with glacial cycles. This repeated climate-driven vicariance has been proposed as a model of speciation across evolutionary lineages codistributed throughout the islands. This model predicts speciation times that are temporally clustered around the times when interglacial rises in sea level fragmented the islands. To test this prediction, we collected comparative genomic data from 16 pairs of insular gecko populations. We analyze these data in a full-likelihood, Bayesian model-choice framework to test for shared divergence times among the pairs. Our results provide support against the species-pump model prediction in favor of an alternative interpretation, namely that each pair of gecko populations diverged independently. These results suggest the repeated bouts of climate-driven landscape fragmentation has not been an important mechanism of speciation for gekkonid lizards on the Philippine Islands.

TI  - Road to ruin? Urbanization increases herbivory in a tropical wildflower but does not lead to the evolution of chemical defence traits
AU  - Rivkin, L. Ruth
AU  - Moura, Antonio
AB  - Abstract
          
            Urbanization is associated with numerous changes to the biotic and abiotic environment, many of which degrade the environment and lead to a loss of biodiversity. Cities often have elevated pollution levels that harm wildlife; however, the increased concentration of some pollutants can fertilize urban plants, leading to corresponding positive effects on herbivore populations. Increases in herbivory rates may lead to natural selection for greater defence phenotypes in plants. However, evidence supporting increased herbivory leading to the evolution of plant defence in urban environments is contradictory, and entirely absent from tropical regions of the world. To address these research gaps, we evaluated herbivory on
            Turnera subulata
            , a common urban wildflower, along an urbanization gradient in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We predicted that higher rates of herbivory in urban areas would lead these populations to evolve cyanogenesis, a chemical defence found in a closely related
            Turnera
            species. We assessed herbivory and screened for cyanogenesis in 32 populations along the urbanization gradient, quantified by the Human Footprint Index. Our results show that urbanization is significantly associated with increased herbivory rates in
            T. subulata
            populations. Despite elevated herbivory, we found no evidence for the evolution of cyanongenesis in any of the populations, suggesting that the fitness effects of leaf herbivory are not extreme enough to select for the evolution of plant defence in these populations. Habitat loss, predator release, and nutrient enrichment likely act together to increase the abundance of herbivorous arthropods, influencing the herbivory patterns observed in our study.

AU  - Jackson, Faith A.
AB  - Abstract
          We present the first major systematic study of land snail diversity on green roofs. We surveyed 27 green roofs and the adjacent ground habitat in six major cities in the southeastern United States. We found a total of 18 species of land snails, with three considered to be non-native, invasive species. The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are “greenhouse” species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. Additionally, some similarity between roof and ground populations indicates dispersal from nearby ground habitats. The major determinants of snail species diversity and community composition are largely derived from local environmental conditions that are significantly correlated to the quality of green roof maintenance regime and plant diversity. Roof area, height, and age are seemingly not significant characteristics that dictate land snail species richness.

AB  - ABSTRACT
          
            Fishing spiders (
            Dolomedes spp.
            ) make an interesting model to predict the impact of global changes because they are generalist, opportunistic predators, whose distribution is driven mostly by abiotic factors. Yet, the two European species are expected to react differently to forthcoming environmental changes, because of habitat specialization and initial range. We used an original combination of habitat and dispersal data to revisit these predictions under various climatic scenarios. We used the future range of suitable habitat, predicted with habitat variables only, as a base layer to further predict the range or reachable habitat by accounting for both dispersal ability and landscape connectivity. Our results confirm the northward shift in range and indicate that the area of co-occurrences should also increase. However, reachable habitat should expand less than suitable habitat, especially when accounting for landscape connectivity. In addition, the potential range expansion was further limited for the red-listed
            D. plantarius
            , which is more habitat-specialist and has a lower ability to disperse. This study highlights the importance of looking beyond habitat variables to produce more accurate predictions for the future of arthropods populations.

AB  - Abstract
          In this study, we tested whether urban landscape structure influences avian species diversity using data for Harare, Zimbabwe. Initially, we quantified landscape structure using fragmentation indices derived from a 5m resolution SPOT 5 imagery. We collected bird species data through field-based observations of birds at 35 locations occurring in five land use/land cover types. We quantified avian species diversity using Barger-Parker, Menhinick and Simpson’s Indices. Regression analysis was used to determine the nature and strength of the relationships between avian species diversity and fragmentation indices. Results indicated that woodland specialist avian species are negatively associated with landscape fragmentation, while grassland specialist and generalist avian species positively responded to patch edge density, habitat patch size and shape complexity. Overall, our results suggest that changes in landscape structure due to expansion of built-up areas in tropical urban areas may influence avian species diversity.

AB  - Abstract
          The metacommunity concept provides a theoretical framework that aims at explaining organism distributions by a combination of environmental filtering, dispersal and drift. With the development of statistical tools to quantify and partially isolate the role of each of these processes, empirical metacommunity studies have multiplied worldwide. However, few works attempt a multi-taxon approach and even fewer compare two distant biogeographical regions using the same methodology. Under this framework, we tested the expectation that temperate (mediterranean-climate) pond metacommunities would be more influenced by environmental and spatial processes than tropical ones, because of stronger environmental gradients and greater isolation of waterbodies.
          We surveyed 30 tropical and 32 mediterranean temporary ponds from Costa Rica and Spain, respectively, and obtained data on 49 environmental variables (including limnological, hydrogeomorphological, biotic, climatic, and landscape variables). We characterized the biological communities of Bacteria and Archaea (from both the water column and the sediments), phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, amphibians and birds, and estimated the relative role of space and environment on metacommunity organization for each group and region, by means of variation partitioning using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).
          Environmental selection was important in both tropical and mediterranean ponds, but markedly stronger in the latter, probably due to their larger limnological heterogeneity. Spatialized environment and pure spatial effects were greater in the tropics, related to higher climatic heterogeneity and dispersal processes (e.g. restriction, surplus) acting at different scales. The variability between taxonomic groups in spatial and environmental contributions was very wide. Effects on passive and active dispersers were similar within regions but different across regions, with higher environmental effects in mediterranean active dispersers. The residual (unexplained) variation was larger in tropical pond metacommunities, suggesting a higher role for stochastic processes and/or effects of biotic interactions in the tropics. Overall, these results provide support, for a wide variety of organisms related to aquatic habitats, for the classical view of stronger abiotic niche constraints in temperate areas compared to the tropics.

AU  - Dennis, Matthew

AU  - James, Philip
AB  - Abstract
          Within urban landscape planning, debate continues around the relative merits of land-sparing (compaction) and land-sharing (sprawl) scenarios. Using part of Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sparing and sharing. We do so for the landscape as a whole as well as for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sparing-sharing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs may be particularly complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sparing and sharing strategies.

AB  - Abstract
          Human activities shape the structure of landscapes in different ways and hence modify animal communities depending on the type and intensity of these activities. Here, we used a multispecies occupancy model (MSOM) to understand mammalian habitat use patterns across a mosaic of tropical dry forest in Colombia and elucidate whether forest cover is more important than its integrity and other landscape configuration metrics. Surprisingly, our data suggest that none of the factors (including forest integrity) had a substantial effect on the mean community habitat use or species richness of mammals across the Montes de Maria, and there was no strong evidence to suggest any particular pattern in the distribution of functional groups in the landscapes. However, the percentage of forest cover was substantially important for herbivores, and consistently showed a moderate effect on the entire community, carnivores guild some individual species. There was high variability in the responses of each species to the examined variables that hinder us from broad generalizations, but in general, we also detected a moderate positive effect of forest cover in both diet specialists and generalists and species with small home ranges. Omnivores, on the other hand, tended to occupy more heterogeneous sites (moderate positive effects). The lack of substantial effects on most species and the absence of threatened species across this anthropogenic landscape suggests that the current community is composed of species tolerant to habitat modifications, but not only diet generalist species. This is most likely due to a long filtering process caused by land use transformation. However, our results highlight the relevance of conserving forest patches regardless of their level of modification or any other landscape attributes for maintaining assemblages of mammals.

AB  - Abstract
          The detrimental effects of human-induced environmental change on people and other species are acutely manifested in urban environments. While urban greenspaces are known to mitigate these effects and support functionally diverse ecological communities, evidence of the ecological outcomes of urban greening remains scarce. We use a longitudinal observational design to provide empirical evidence of the putative ecological benefits of greening actions. We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct. Our findings provide crucial evidence that support best practice in greenspace design and contribute to re-invigorate policies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanisation on people and other species.

AB  - Abstract
          Land use intensification in urban areas can have profound effects on biological communities that provide valuable ecosystem services to urban residents. We used a functional response and effect trait approach to determine how bird species’ responses to local and landscape-scale habitat of urban green spaces affects the supply of cultural and regulating ecosystem services. We sampled bird communities and habitat variables in urban green spaces that varied in local and landscape-scale habitat composition and compiled a dataset of species’ response and effect traits related to nesting, foraging, diet, and visual and acoustic aesthetic appeal. Overall, the landscape-scale context of a green space had a stronger influence on species’ abundances than local-scale habitat. Landscape-scale impervious surface surrounding our study sites interacted with response traits related to nesting in human-built structures, clutch size, and consumption of invertebrates to drive bird species’ abundances. Because correlations between response and effect traits can influence the effect traits available to provide ecosystem services at a site, we explored the correlation of these three response traits to a suite of effect traits and found the response traits were correlated with several effect traits related to diet and regulating services but correlated with few of the plumage and acoustic traits that produce cultural services. Finally, we found that effect traits associated with cultural and regulating ecosystem services varied strongly along the landscape-scale gradient of urbanization. Sites with high impervious surface cover are expected to have low levels of invertebrate pest control and visual appeal but high levels of acoustic appeal, diet evenness (generalism), and granivory. Overall, our study highlights the key role of landscape-scale habitat in driving bird-mediated ecosystem services and underscores the importance of regional urban planning to create healthy and livable cities.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Disentangling the contemporary and historical factors underlying the spatial distributions of species is a central goal of biogeography. For species with broad distributions but little capacity to actively disperse, disconnected geographic distributions highlight the potential influence of passive, long-distance dispersal (LDD) on their evolutionary histories. However, dispersal alone cannot completely account for the biogeography of any species, and other factors–e.g., habitat suitability, life history–must also be considered. North American ice worms (
            Mesenchytraeus solifugus
            ) are ice-obligate annelids that inhabit coastal glaciers from Oregon to Alaska. Previous studies identified a complex biogeographic history for ice worms, with evidence for genetic isolation, unexpectedly close relationships among geographically disjunct lineages, and contemporary migration across large (> 1,500 km) areas of unsuitable habitat. In this study, we analyzed genome-scale sequence data for most of the known ice worm range. We found clear support for divergence between populations along the Pacific Coast and the inland flanks of the Coast Mountains (mean F
            ST
            = 0.60), likely precipitated by episodic ice sheet expansion and contraction during the Pleistocene. We also found support for LDD of ice worms from Alaska to Vancouver Island, perhaps mediated by migrating birds. Our results highlight the power of genomic data for disentangling complex biogeographic patterns, including the presence of LDD.

AB  - Abstract
          
            The homogenous nature of the urban environment rapidly alters community dynamics of extant flora and fauna due to short-term spatial and temporal factors. However, such impacts of urbanization are mostly investigated in terms of taxonomic diversity, while its impact on functional diversity remains poorly understood. Whereas taxonomic information is limited to the identity of species, functional traits determine the relationship between species identity and ecosystem functioning. Studies investigating the role of urbanization in altering these ecological parameters have mostly focused on avian communities or plant species, while arthropods such as spiders which are integral components of urban households have largely been overlooked. This study aims to understand the impact of urbanization on both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of spider assemblages across an urban–semi-urban–forest gradient in Guwahati, a rapidly growing city in northeast India. We surveyed spiders at 13 sites representing four habitat types (urban, urban parks, semi-urban, and forests) using belt transects, and also recorded functional traits relating to key life history processes. Spider species composition differed significantly between various habitats. The taxonomic diversity of spiders was highest in forests and lowest in urban parks. The turnover component was the major contributor to changing the β-diversity of spiders. Reduced diversity in urban regions was likely due to the dominance of a few synanthropic species. Generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the habitat types significantly impacted spider abundance. Functional richness was maximum in forests (F
            ric
            = 23.43) and minimum in urban habitats (F
            ric
            = 12.98), while functional divergence was maximum in urban sites (F
            div
            = 0.79). Our study demonstrates that urban land-use change can alter the structure and functioning of the spider community.

            Urbanisation is currently increasing worldwide, and there is now ample evidence of phenotypic changes in wild organisms in response to this novel environment, but the extent to which this adaptation is due to genetic changes is poorly understood. Current evidence for evolution is based on localised studies, and thus lacking replicability. Here, we genotyped great tits (
            Parus major
            ) from nine cities across Europe, each paired with a rural site, and provide evidence of repeated polygenic responses to urban habitats. In addition, we show that selective sweeps occurred in response to urbanisation within the same genes across multiple cities. These genetic responses were mostly associated with genes related to neural function and development, demonstrating that genetic adaptation to urbanisation occurred around the same pathways in wildlife populations across a large geographical scale.

TI  - Mangrove forest structure and composition along urban gradients in Puerto Rico
AU  - Branoff, Benjamin
AU  - Martinuzzi, Sebastian
AB  - Urban forests are repeatedly characterized as distinct in composition and structure in comparison with their non-urban counterparts. This holds true for mangroves, although previous studies lack quantified representations of urbanness as well as any inclusion of hydrology or water chemistry, which are important influences on mangrove forest structure, composition, and function. This study uses LiDAR and ground-based measurements of mangroves within well quantified urban gradients in Puerto Rico to test for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed patterns of forest structure and composition. In simple regression, urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition but not structure. Results show higher tree diversity but lower mangrove diversity in the most urban forests. Structural measurements, however, were best explained by flooding, surface water chemistry, and non-urban land cover metrics.  Nitrogen concentrations best explained stem density and tree size, while flooding metrics best explained stand biomass and basal area, and surrounding vegetation cover best explained canopy cover and height metrics. In multiple regression, land cover and surface water chemistry were more important than flooding, with population density again being the most important variable in explaining mangrove forest diversity. Results show that urbanization is an important influence on mangrove composition and basal area, leading to higher tree diversity and lower basal area, consistent with patterns in terrestrial forests. But urban mangrove forests are also lower in mangrove diversity and tend to have representation only by Laguncularia racemosa. Nitrogen concentrations and surrounding vegetation cover, both of which are indirectly influenced by urbanization, were positively related to tree size and canopy cover and height, respectively. These tests suggest urbanization is an important influence on mangrove forest structure and composition, but that flooding and water chemistry must also be considered when managing these forests.

AU  - Schmidt, Chloé
AU  - Garroway, Colin J
AB  - Abstract
          Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading causes of vertebrate population declines. These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing population sizes in human transformed habitats. With time this can lead to reduced effective population size and genetic diversity which restricts the ability of wildlife to cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects are generally applicable across taxa. Here, we repurposed and synthesized raw microsatellite data from online repositories from 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density and the Human Footprint Index, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found no consistent relationships for any of our genetic metrics. While we did not detect directional effects for most species, a few generalist species responded positively to urbanization. These results contrast with consistent negative effects of urbanization in mammals and species specific positive and negative effects in birds. In the context of widespread amphibian declines, our results suggest that habitat loss in human transformed habitats is a more immediate concern than declining genetic diversity in populations that persist.

            Population genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse,
            Mus musculus domesticus
            , in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.

AU  - Poisot, Timothée
AB  - Abstract
          
            Connectivity among habitat patches in both natural and disturbed landscapes needs to be accounted for in conservation planning for biodiversity maintenance. Yet methods to assess connectivity are often limited, because simulating the dispersal of many species is computationally prohibitive, and current simulations make simplifying assumptions about movement that are potentially erroneous. Here we show how these limits can be circumvented and propose a novel framework for the assessment of omnifunctional and omnidirectional connectivity in a 28000 km2 area in the Laurentian region of Québec, Canada. Our approach relies on (i) the use of
            Omniscape
            , an improved version of
            Circuitscape
            which allows omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of species-level dispersal simulations through
            a posteriori
            clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots, suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for the multiplicity of dispersal strategies. Although this approach requires a large volume of computing resources, it provides richer information on which landscape features are critical to maintain or need to be regenerated for broader biodiversity maintenance goals.

AB  - Abstract
          
          Urbanization and associated environmental changes are causing global declines in vertebrate populations. In general, population declines of the magnitudes now detected should lead to reduced effective population sizes for animals living in proximity to humans and disturbed lands. This is cause for concern because effective population sizes set the rate of genetic diversity loss due to genetic drift, the rate of increase in inbreeding, and the efficiency with which selection can act on beneficial alleles. We predicted that the effects of urbanization should decrease effective population size and genetic diversity, and increase population-level genetic differentiation. To test for such patterns, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived genetic data sets for North American birds and mammals. After filtering, we had usable raw genotype data from 85 studies and 41,023 individuals, sampled from 1,008 locations spanning 41 mammal and 25 bird species. We used census-based urban-rural designations, human population density, and the Human Footprint Index as measures of urbanization and habitat disturbance. As predicted, mammals sampled in more disturbed environments had lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and were more genetically differentiated from those in more natural environments. There were no consistent relationships detectable for birds. This suggests that, in general, mammal populations living near humans may have less capacity to respond adaptively to further environmental changes, and be more likely to suffer from effects of inbreeding.

AB  - Abstract
          Pollinating invertebrates are vital to terrestrial ecosystems but are impacted by anthropogenic habitat loss/fragmentation and climate change. Conserving and improving landscape connectivity is important to offset those threats, yet its assessment for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the functional connectivity between protected areas in Australia for 59 butterfly species, under present conditions and different future scenarios (for 2050 and 2090) of land-use, land-cover, and climate change. Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar. Under future scenarios, functional connectivity is predicted to decrease overall, with negative changes worsening from 2050 to 2090, although a few species are positive exceptions. We have made our results available as spatial datasets to allow comparisons with taxa from other studies and can be used to identify priority areas for conservation in terms of establishing ecological corridors or stepping-stone habitat patches. Our study highlights the importance of considering pollinating invertebrates when seeking holistic conservation and restoration of a landscape’s functional connectivity, underscoring the need to expand and promote protected areas to facilitate functional connectivity under future scenarios of global change.

AB  - Abstract
          Taxa with disjunct distributions are common in montane biotas and offer excellent opportunities to investigate historical processes underlying genetic and phenotypic divergence. In this context, subgenomic datasets offer novel opportunities to explore historical demography in detail, which is key to better understand the origins and maintenance of diversity in montane regions. Here we used a large ultraconserved elements dataset to get insights into the main biogeographic processes driving the evolution of the Montane Atlantic Forest biota. Specifically, we studied two species of warbling finches disjunctly distributed across a region of complex geological and environmental history. We found that a scenario of three genetically differentiated populations is best supported by genomic clustering methods. Also, demographic simulations support simultaneous isolation of these populations at ~10 kya, relatively stable population sizes over recent time, and recent gene flow. Our results suggest a dual role of climate: population divergence, mediated by isolation in mountain tops during warm periods, as well as population maintenance - allowing persistence mediated by shifts in elevation distribution during periods of climate change, with episodic bouts contact and gene flow. Additional support for the role of climate comes from evidence of their contact in a recent past. We propose that two major gaps, which we call São Paulo and Caparaó subtropical gaps, have been historically important in the divergence of cold adapted organisms in the Atlantic Forest, and could be associated to cryptic diversity. Finally, our results suggest that shallow divergence and past gene flow may be common in montane organisms, but complex demographic histories may be detectable only when using subgenomic or genomic datasets.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Animal movement can impact human-wildlife conflict through a variety of features: increased movement can lead to greater chance of encounter, remaining still can lead to greater or lesser detection, and activity can modulate their impact on humans. Here we assess the movement and space use of the highly venomous and medically important Malayan krait (
            Bungarus candidus
            ) on a suburban university campus. We radio- tracked 14 kraits for an average of 114 days (min: 19, max: 218), with an average of 106 fixes (min: 21, max: 229). We assessed movement pathways and activity with dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models, evaluated patterns of revisitation to identify site fidelity, and determined whether individuals selected for particular land-use types with Integrated Step Selection Functions. Most individuals displayed some level of attraction to buildings (n = 10) and natural areas (n = 12); we identified a similar unambiguous pattern of attraction to buildings and natural areas at the population level (of our sample). Snakes remained in shelter sites for long periods of time (max = 94 days) and revisited sites on average every 15.45 days. Over 50% of fixes were within human settlements and 37.1% were associated with buildings. We found generally seasonal patterns of activity, with higher activity in wet seasons (when classes are typically in session on campus), and lower activity in the hot season (when there are a number of short breaks causing students to leave campus). These results show frequent proximity between Malayan kraits and humans at Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; thereby, suggesting a near constant potential for human- wildlife conflict. Despite the fact that no snakebites from this species occurred at the university during our study period, substantial education and awareness training should be considered to raise awareness to ensure continued coexistence on campus.

AB  - Abstract
          The rapid expansion of urban areas in which natural and semi-natural areas are replaced by human infrastructure, such as buildings and streets, is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. However, little is known about how the structure of biotic communities is affected by urbanization in the tropics. Here, we tested the effect of land use types in urban and peri-urban areas on frog species richness and community composition in central Brazil. We selected 20 ponds differing in size and surrounding levels of urbanization as well as natural forest cover. We then used a Poisson GLM and a distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA) to relate species richness and community composition, respectively, to environmental variables. Variation in species richness was best explained by pond size (positive effect) and amount of urbanization (negative effect) in the surrounding 500 m. Community composition was mainly driven by species turnover than by nestedness, with db-RDA showing that turnover was explained primarily by urban infrastructure and forest cover. Our results indicate that urbanization negatively influences species richness. Moreover, as the amount of urbanization increased, several species were replaced by others taxa that appear better adapted to urban environments. Our results indicate that maintaining large ponds with surrounding native vegetation in urban environments might be an effective strategy for conserving frog communities.

              We collected mtDNA sequence data for 288 individuals thoroughly covering the range of the
              Henicorhina leucophrys
              complex from Mexico to Bolivia. Sequences were employed to characterize population structure, infer phylogenetic relationships among populations and their divergence times, examine lineage accumulation through time, and identify presumptive species using coalescent methods. We also explored the origin of elevational and latitudinal replacements involved in spatial changes in species assemblages in the Andes.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              We found remarkable genetic structure within the complex, which consists of numerous lineages reaching >12% sequence divergence; most divergent populations occur in areas separated by topographic barriers but several of them, typically not sister to each other, co-occur with elevational segregation on mountain slopes or replace each other with latitude along the Andes. Some close relatives occur in areas separated by thousands of kilometers, with more distant relatives occupying intervening areas. The complex likely originated in the Mexican highlands and expanded extensively in South America while diverging rapidly at a constant rate into many different lineages which have persisted for millions of years. Coalescent analyses consistently revealed that the complex may comprise more than 30 species; while we do not suggest these presumptive species should be recognized by taxonomists in the absence of additional data,
              H. leucophrys
              is a distant outlier among New World birds in terms of high lineage diversity within a single recognized species.
            
          
          
            Main Conclusions
            Our study captured wood-wren lineages in the act of building up diversity via divergence and persistence in allopatry, achievement of secondary sympatry, and coexistence at the landscape scale mediated by ecological and evolutionary divergence. Although dispersal by wood-wrens is restricted at present and this likely accounts for strong population structure across topographic barriers, their ranges have been dynamic, managing to disperse over much of the montane Neotropics. Phases of expansion and contraction of ranges and localized extinctions of populations likely account for phylogeographic patterns which are precursors to the origin of new species and the accumulation of diversity in tropical mountains.

AB  - Abstract
          
            
              
                Urbanization gradients influence both landscape and climate and provide opportunity for understanding how species, especially plants and pollinators, respond to artificially driven environmental transitions.
              
              
                Here, we investigated several aspects of pollination along an urbanization gradient in landscape and climate. We quantified wild hoverfly and bee abundances with trapping, standing crop of nectar with spectrophotometer, and the pollen transported by flower-visitors with DNA-metabarcoding, in 40 independent sites from seminatural to built-up areas in Northern Italy.
              
              
                Linear and nonlinear relationships were detected along the urbanization gradient. Pollinator abundances increased until 22% of impervious surface, dropping by 34% after that, and it also decreased with green patch distance and urban park size. Thus, suburban landscapes host more pollinators than highly cemented or seminatural areas. Moreover, pollinators diminished by up to 45% in areas with low temperature seasonality: urbanized areas likely posing thermic stress. Furthermore, the sugar mass available in nectar increased by 91% with impervious cover, indicating that city nectars were less consumed or flowers more productive. Furthermore, the species richness of pollen decreased by 32% in highly urbanized areas, and with a high incidence of exotic plants, hinting for anthropized plant communities.
              
              
                
                  Synthesis and applications
                  . Urbanization influences pollinator abundances, nectar resources and transported pollen. Pollinators are negatively affected by a thermally harsh climate in highly urbanized areas with isolated green areas and large parks. Suburban landscapes demonstrated the highest pollinator presence. In the city core, flowers contained more nectary sugar, while pollinators collected pollen from a small number of plants, mainly exotic. These findings highlight the influence of urban landscape structure and climate on pollinators and plants, showing that cities are heterogenous realities. Patterns from this study will serve as basis for pollinator-friendly planning and management of urban landscapes.

AU  - Mayer, Frieder
AB  - ABSTRACT
          
            Behavioral isolation is a potent barrier to gene flow and a source of striking diversity in the animal kingdom. However, it remains unclear if the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sex-specific traits required for behavioral isolation results mostly from physical linkage between signal and preference loci or from directional mate preferences. Here, we test this in the field crickets
            Gryllus rubens
            and
            G. texensis
            . These closely related species diverged with gene flow and have strongly diverged songs and preference functions for the mate calling song rhythm. We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome. We suggest that the finely-tuned, highly divergent preference functions are likely an additional source of LD between male and female traits in this system. Furthermore, pleiotropy of gene expression presents an underappreciated mechanism to link sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

AB  - Abstract
          Assessing the road effects on biodiversity is challenging because impacts may depend on both wildlife responses to roads and on the spatial arrangement of roads. We questioned whether an increase in road encroachment i.e., the advancement of roads into non-urban areas, leads to significant changes (positive and negative) in species occurrence, and if so, whether those changes are linked to specific traits related to perturbation sensitiveness, therefore acting as filters that increase the community compositional dissimilarity. Using a large citizen-science dataset of point-counts performed throughout Iberian Peninsula (4,459 unique survey sites), we modelled the effect of road density on the occurrence of common songbirds (n=58), while accounting for potential confounding effects of environment and survey effort. We then tested if species’ occurrence patterns would be linked to specific traits related to the ability to cope with human presence. Finally, we assessed how road density affect the community compositional dissimilarity. We estimated 24 (41%) and 12 (21%) species to be negatively and positively affected by roads, respectively. Increased road encroachment was positively related with a higher prevalence of urban dwellers and negatively related with the occurrence of species nesting and foraging on the ground. Furthermore, increasing road density translated into an increasing community compositional dissimilarity, mostly due to species turnover. Our study support previous research showing that roads have different effects on the occurrence of different species, but we revealed that at least three species' traits have a clear relation with such road responses. Such trait filtering is probably causing a high species turnover between songbird communities occurring in roaded and nearby roadless areas. Overall, we found that different species-specific responses to roads translates into changes at the community level. Landscape and road-network management should be conceived acknowledging that roads are contributing to biodiversity changes. As so, building upon the concepts of Land Sharing / Land Sparing, conservation actions should be tailored according to the different species responses e.g., road verge management targeting species having a positive relation with road density; and compensation actions targeting species showing a negative response toward roads.

TI  - Quantifying Costs of Urbanisation: Wetland Loss and Impacts in a Rapidly Developing Global City
AU  - Gabites, Harriet

AB  - Abstract
          
            
              
                As cities grow, natural ecosystems decline through conversion to urban environments. Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments.
              
              
                Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess.
              
              
                
                  We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the world’s fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (
                  Chelodina longicollis
                  ) that people interact with regularly or have as pets.
                  Chelodina longicollis
                  utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation.
                
              
              
                Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss.
              
              
                Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that ∼40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation.
              
              
                Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes. Urban wetlands (natural and constructed) may provide “biodiversity arks” for endangered species and facilitate community led conservation programs.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Aim
            We present a Constraint-based Model of Dynamic Island Biogeography (C-DIB) that predicts how species functional traits interact with dynamic environments to determine the candidate species available for local community assembly on real and habitat islands through time.
          
          
            Location
            Real and habitat islands globally.
          
          
            Methods
            We develop the C-DIB model concept, synthesize the relevant literature, and present a toolkit for evaluating model predictions for a wide variety of “island” systems and taxa.
          
          
            Results
            The C-DIB model reveals that as islands cycle between phases of increasing or decreasing size and connectivity to a source pool, the dominant process driving species’ presence or absence switches between colonization and extinction. Both processes are mediated by interactions between organismal traits and environmental constraints. Colonization probability is predicted by a species’ ability to cross the intervening matrix between a population source and the island; population persistence (or extinction) is predicted by the minimum spatial requirements to sustain an isolated population. The non-random distributions of mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf and Great Basin “sky islands” provide example study systems for evaluating the C-DIB model.
          
          
            Main conclusions
            
              Because different suites of traits impose constraints on the processes of colonization and extinction, similar environmental conditions can host different candidate species despite the same predicted richness. Thus, the model exemplifies the specific yet underappreciated role of
              hysteresis
              –the dependency of outcomes not only on the current system state –but also the historical contingency of environmental change in affecting populations and communities in insular systems.

AB  - Abstract
          
            Lichenized fungi are evolutionarily diverse and ecologically important, but little is known about the processes driving diversification and genetic differentiation in these lineages. Though few studies have examined population genetic patterns in lichens, their geographic distributions are often assumed to be wholly shaped by ecological requirements rather than dispersal limitations. Furthermore, while their reproductive structures are observable, the lack of information about recombination mechanisms and rates can make inferences about reproductive strategies difficult. Here we investigate the population genomics of
            Cetradonia linearis
            , an endangered lichen narrowly endemic to the southern Appalachians of eastern North America, to test the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance in shaping genetic structure, and to gain insights into the demography and reproductive biology of range restricted fungi. Analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for strong isolation by distance, but did not support isolation by environment. Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity also suggested that
            C. linearis
            had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, consistent with previous findings in other southern Appalachian taxa. These results contribute to our understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic factors shaping genetic diversity and biogeographic patterns in
            C. linearis
            , and more broadly, in rare and endangered fungi.

TI  - Climate gradients, and patterns of biodiversity and biotic homogenization in urban residential yards
AU  - Bergey, Elizabeth A.
AU  - Whipkey, Benjamin E.
AB  - Abstract
          Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 × 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = −8.4 to 0.1 °C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall – likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sørensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance - patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-decay pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.

AB  - Abstract
          
            The domestic cat (
            Felis catus
            ) is the most popular companion animal and the most abundant carnivore globally. It is also a pet with an immense ecological footprint, because even non-feral and food-subsidized cats are prolific predators. Whereas knowledge about the spatial behavior of individual domestic cats is growing, we still know little about how a local population of free-ranging pet cats occupies the landscape. Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface - the “catscape” - that potential prey have to navigate. There were almost no gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 meters to their owner’s home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats. We discuss the catscape as a conceptual and quantitative tool for better understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of domestic cats.

AB  - Abstract
            
              As human populations move into cities they are increasingly isolated from the natural world, with associated negative impacts on health and well-being. However, as cities renew themselves through urban redevelopment and climate-adaptation, opportunities arise to improve people’s access to urban green areas that can be informed by modeling the network of urban open spaces. Recent research identified the need for multi-criteria indices of access to urban green spaces. Including open spaces such as empty lots, ground- and air-spaces surrounding buildings, and spaces associated with roads and other linear features can improve planning for urban greenspaces by identifying areas of opportunity for additional greening. Further, the gradient of interconnections among open spaces can be used to prioritize urban greening locations to build green networks. We modelled all open-space connections across 605 km
              2
              in Seoul, population 10.3 million, using Omniscape, a landscape connectivity model. We combined the resulting open-space connectivity map with distance-based indices for existing urban parks and street trees. Combining these criteria permits rank-prioritization of locations where new green spaces would most improve residents’ access. We found 2910 of 3375 (86.2%) locations where urban green spaces already exist within 300 m for city residents. Of the remaining 465 locations, 276 are in areas with the lowest-open space connections. For urban street trees, 44.3% of the 2588 km of the city’s major roads are already planted with street trees. Of the remainder, 210 km (8.1%) are located in the areas with the least connections to green spaces. Nine new urban parks would provide relief for the most highly-impacted areas, where the flow of open space is lowest and where no green spaces are available within 300 m. The integration of a spatial model typically used for conservation assessments with city planning provides useful additional context for building urban health.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use has led to the loss and fragmentation of native habitats and disruption to ecosystem processes, resulting in a decline in landscape connectivity and biodiversity. Here, in order to find the potentials of improvements in ecological connectivity, we provide a spatial analysis to present differences in ecological connectivity based on land cover maps and urban habitat maps in Suwon city, Republic of Korea. We generated two permeability maps for use in a network analysis, one being land cover and the other urban habitat, including a 5-km buffer area from the city boundary. We then determined the current-flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) for each map. Our results indicate that forests are typically the most highly connected areas in both maps. However, in the land cover map results, nearly all high-priority areas were in the mountainous region (CFBC value: 0.0100 ± 0.0028), but the urban habitat indicated that grasslands and rivers within the city also significantly contribute to connectivity (CFBC value: 0.0071 ± 0.0022). The CFBC maps developed here could be used as a reference when introducing green infrastructure in cities. Before establishing ecological networks for urban areas, future work should integrate the land use and ecological data of different administrative districts with continuous ecological connection.

AB  - The structure and function of green-space system is an eternal subject of landscape architecture, especially due to limited land and a need for the coordinated development of PLEs (production, living, and ecological spaces). To make planning more scientific, this paper explored green-space structure planning via multidimensional perspectives and methods using a case study of Zhengzhou. The paper applies theories (from landscape architecture and landscape ecology) and technologies (like remote sensing, GIS—geographic information system, graph theory, and aerography) from different disciplines to analyze current green-space structure and relevant physical factors to identify and exemplify different green-space planning strategies. Overall, our analysis reveals that multiple green-space structures should be considered together and that planners and designers should have multidisciplinary knowledge. For specific strategies, the analysis finds (i) that green complexes enhance various public spaces and guide comprehensive development of urban spaces; (ii) that green ecological corridors play a critical role in regional ecological stability through maintaining good connectivity and high node degree (Dg) and betweenness centrality index (BC) green spaces; (iii) that greenway networks can integrate all landscape resources to provide more secured spaces for animals and beautiful public spaces for humans; (iv) that blue-green ecological networks can help rainwater and urban flooding disaster management; and (v) that green ventilation corridors provide air cleaning and urban cooling benefits, which can help ensure healthy and comfortable urban–rural environments. In our view, this integrated framework for planning and design green-space structure helps make the process scientific and relevant for guiding future regional green-space structure.

AU  - Strauss, Barbara

T2  - Ecography
AB  - In urban brownfields (derelict sites), we studied the influence of local factors (successional age, vegetation structure, soil) and landscape context (spatial arrangement of brownfields of different successional stages) on the diversity of phytophagous insects, grasshoppers and leafhoppers (Orthoptera and Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). The study was conducted on a total of 246 plots in the cities of Bremen and Berlin, Germany. We used a habitat modelling approach, enabling us to predict the community from single species models (30 species in Bremen, 28 in Berlin). The results revealed that communities were predominantly determined by vegetation structure, followed by landscape context, soil parameters and site age. For most species, local factors were the most important. Only few species were strongly influenced by landscape context, even though some showed clear negative reactions to low proportions of brownfields in the surroundings. Along a successional gradient of vegetation structure, from scarce and low to dense and high vegetation, the insect community was not static. Even though species numbers remained comparatively constant, species composition changed considerably. Many species showed clear preferences for certain successional stages. Thus, maintaining the regional species pool of a city requires a mosaic of all successional stages.

AB  - ABSTRACT. For birds in urban environments, the configuration of local habitat within the landscape may be as critical as the composition of the local habitat itself. We examined the relative importance of environmental attributes (e.g., tree cover, composition, and number of tree species) measured at different spatial scales in relation to urban bird species richness and abundance. We expected that some bird species and nesting guilds would have a closer association with landscape-level features (within 1000 m), such as proximity to large forested areas, than with local-scale habitat measures (within 50 m). To investigate this, avian community data were collected at 285 point-count stations in 1997 and 1998 along four roadside transects located in Vancouver and Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Transects (5–25 km in length) bisected three large parks (>324 ha) and proceeded along residential streets in urban and suburban areas. In total, 48 bird species were observed, including 25 common species. Species richness declined in relation to a gradient of increasing urbanization, as measured by local- and landscape-level habitat features. We further examined the significance and importance of local- vs. landscape-level habitat attributes using logistic regression and found that both scales explained the presence/absence distributions of residential birds. Local-scale habitat features such as large coniferous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and freshwater streams were of particular importance in estimating the likelihood of finding bird species. Landscape measures, particularly forest cover (within 500 m) and park area (measured at different scales as a function of distance from point-count stations) significantly improved likelihood estimations based solely on local-scale habitat features. Our results suggest that both local- and landscape-scale resources were important in determining the distribution of birds in urban areas. Parks, reserves, and the surrounding residential areas should be integrated into urban planning and development designs to maintain resident avifauna and overall species diversity in urban environments.

AB  - We investigated the spatiotem-poral dynamics of a breeding bird community in the urbanized landscape of Lublin city (150 km 2 , 0.5 million inhabitants, SE Poland). We conducted 211 separate territory mapping surveys during 26 years (1982–2007) in 24 green areas (0.2–30.1 ha in size), distributed along an urbanization gradient. We recorded a total of 16,151 territories of 65 species. According to the estimated species richness , we detected all the species present in the studied plots. the three species community indices (species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and abundance – number of breeding pairs in census plot) increased with increasing tree stand age and area of the site, while it decreased as the proportion of biologically inactive areas increased. the three indices showed significant negative trends as the study period progressed. the mean decreasing rate was 0.2 species and 2.3 territories per year. Distance to the city centre and under-storey cover negatively affected bird abundance, while they positively affected species richness and the Shannon index. tree stand age seems to be the most important of the three indices among the analyzed explanatory variables. Our results show that the diversity of breeding avifauna in an urbanized landscape can be significantly shaped by the proper management of vegetation and size of green areas in the city. the long term decline of the three diversity indices seems to be the most important outcome of our study and requires further research and monitoring.

AB  - With the widespread population growth in cities, anthropogenic influences inevitably lead to natural disturbances. The metropolitan area of Istanbul, with its rapid urbanization rate, has faced intense pressure regarding the sustainability of urban habitats. In this context, landscapes comprising patches affected by various disturbances and undergoing temporal changes must be analyzed, in order to assess city-related disturbances. In this study, the main objective was to understand how urbanization changed the function of the spatial distribution of the urban mosaic and, more specifically, its relationship with the size, shape, and connection among land-use classes. For this purpose, we took Besiktas, a district of Istanbul, as the study area. We evaluated the landscape pattern of the urban environment in two stages. First, we used medium-resolution satellite imagery to reveal the general interactions in the urbanization process. Landscape- and class-level landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape connectivity, and the distances between classes (green areas and artificial surfaces), patterns, and processes, using five satellite images representing a time span of 51 years (1963, 1984, 1997, 2005, and 2014). The general landscape structure was examined by looking at the temporal–spatial processes of artificial surface and green areas obtained from these medium-resolution satellite images. The trends in selected landscape-level metrics were specified and discussed through the use of a moving window analysis. We then used Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery (2015) to analyze the landscape structure in more detail. This high-resolution base image allows us to recognize the possibility of classifying basic cultural landscape classes. The findings regarding the spatial arrangement of each class in the areas allocated to 14 cultural landscape classes were interpreted by associating them with the landscape functions. Finally, particulate matter (PM10) concentration data were collected and evaluated as an ecological indicator, in order to reveal the relationships between landscape structure and landscape function. In short, we first evaluated the whole landscape structure using medium-resolution data, followed by the classification of cultural landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a time-effective—and, therefore, essential—auxiliary method for landscape evaluation. This two-stage evaluation method enables inferences to be made that can shed light on the landscape functions in an urban environment based on the landscape structure.

AB  - Abstract
          A significant gap in understanding the response of biodiversity to urban areas is the lack of long-term studies. Most of the information on urban birds comes from studies carried out in the northern hemisphere, and they include data that don’t exceed three years. Although short-term studies contribute to knowledge about bird community diversity and their spatial distribution in urban areas, they could be biased towards more conspicuous and abundant species. One of the few multi-temporal datasets available for birds in urban areas is the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Using annual CBC data available between 2001 and 2018 from 21 urban and peri-urban sample sites assessed from the main cities of Colombia, we identified and analyzed long-term trends on the cumulative diversity of bird communities as well as on their spatial distribution. We estimated comparative trends in richness, abundance, similarity, and complementarity of avifauna for each city and sample site based on their responses to urbanization and dietary guilds. We identified almost a quarter of the species registered in Colombia (464 of 1954). The representativeness of the community obtained during 18 years exceeds 84%, showing richness that ranges between 214 and 278 species in the three cities. Bird species and individuals registered showed wide variation of the sample sites. We found more dwellers, insectivorous and granivorous species in urban areas, with frugivores relegated to peri-urban sites, usually coinciding with avoider species. Natural peri-urban areas and intra-urban wetlands and urban parks were the most important refuges for birds and maintained the highest avoider and utilizer species richness. Long-term inventories are fundamental for determining consolidated bird diversity and distributional patterns. This information established a baseline for decision-making and applying recommendations that allow reconciling the growing demand for urban areas with the need to preserve the native avifauna in megadiverse Neotropical countries such as Colombia.

AB  - Aim: To predict the distribution of suitable habitats for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) at a highly fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia and to identify the potential connectivity between suitable habitat patches.  Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4.  Results: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks.        Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning in conservation, management and development.

AB  - Abstract
          Urbanisation is a growing phenomenon causing the decline of wild bees globally. Yet, bees manage to persist in the urban matrix thanks to islands of vegetation in public parks and private gardens. While we begin to comprehend the impact of urbanisation on bees’ diversity and abundance, our understanding of its impact on the functional diversity of wild bees is limited. Here, we use an integrative approach to investigate the response of wild bees to urbanisation at the community, species, and individual levels. To do so, we sampled wild bees in 24 public parks along an urbanisation gradient in the Mediterranean city of Marseille. We found that species richness and abundance decreased in more urbanised areas, but increased in larger city parks. Moreover, larger individuals within species, but not larger species, were found in larger city parks, suggesting that park size is crucial for the persistence of bees in cities. Interestingly, we show that brighter species were found in parks surrounded by a large amount of impervious surface, highlighting the importance of colour traits in the response to environmental changes. Finally, our results revealed that larger species, but not larger individuals, were also more colourful. In summary, our study not only confirmed that urbanisation negatively impacts community-level traits, but that it also affects species’ coloration and individuals’ body size, thus improving our understanding of the functional response of wild bees to urbanisation. We suggest that increasing park size may compensate for the negative effects of urbanisation on wild bees.

AB  - Urban–rural interfaces represent complex systems that require complex solutions for sustainable development and resilience against pollution, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss and impaired flux of ecosystem services (ES). Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly recognised as an effective tool for addressing such a complexity, but needs priority setting to maximise benefits and minimise drawbacks of implementation. Therefore, a prioritisation approach focused on biodiversity and ES in peri-urban areas is required. In the present work, a systematic and hierarchical framework is proposed for setting priority GI objectives, location and actions aimed at enhancing local biodiversity, ES flux and farming sustainability in urban peripheries. By means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome, the framework allowed identification of the main demand for ES and biodiversity; the most suitable location for GI implementation; and the best cost-effective actions. The GI implementation showed an improvement in terms of wooded hedgerow density, an increase regarding the ecological connectivity of riparian ecosystems, and an increment of agroecosystems designated to enhance the ecological network and wildlife support. Finally, the prioritisation framework contributes to fostering environmental benefits while complying with regulations and management practices from the regional to the farm/field decision level.

AB  - Green infrastructure is a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas that are designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. It incorporates green and blue spaces and other physical features in terrestrial and marine areas. Despite the increase of green infrastructure planning in several regions of the world, such as Europe and North America, there is still a complexity and diversity associated with the concept of green infrastructure that influences the variance in approaches of green infrastructure planning. This research proposed a multi-criteria method that was organized in four steps for designing a green infrastructure for the municipality of Setúbal (Portugal) that efficiently integrated the ecological and social components in the planning and policymaking processes, as well as green infrastructure planning principles. The results show a green infrastructure that comprised around 91% of the territory of the case study, organized into two systems: the fundamental green infrastructure, which was related to the areas whose ecological interests were more favorable, and the urban green infrastructure, which aimed to enhance and intensify ecological processes in built-up areas. This approach focused on the protection of ecological functions, the preservation of the cultural and natural heritage, and the prevention of risks at a local level; it also followed several green infrastructure planning principles, namely, connectivity, multifunctionality, diversity, integration, and applicability.

AB  - Abstract
ContextAnthropogenic landscape modification and fragmentation result in loss of species and can alter ecosystem function. Assessment of the ecological value of urban reserve networks requires baseline and continued monitoring. However, depending on the desired indicators and parameters, effective monitoring can involve extensive sampling that is often financially or logistically infeasible.
AimsWe employed a low-intensity, mixed-detector survey design to monitor the small-mammal community across a network of 53 fragmented forest preserves (225 sites) in a highly urbanised landscape in the Chicago metropolitan area from August to October, 2009–2012.
MethodsWe used a sequential process to fit single-season occupancy and pairwise co-occurrence models for six common small mammal species to evaluate habitat associations and interspecific interactions.
Key resultsShrew species and meadow voles occurred more often in open canopy-associated habitats, whereas occupancy was greater for eastern chipmunks, grey squirrels and white-footed mice in closed-canopy habitats. Habitat associations were complicated by negative pairwise interactions, resulting in reduced occurrence of meadow voles when predatory short-tailed shrews were present and lower occupancy rates of white-footed mouse when chipmunk competitors where present. White-footed mice co-occurred with short-tailed shrews, but detection of white-footed mice was lower when either eastern chipmunks or short-tailed shrews were present, suggesting that densities of these species could be inversely related.
ConclusionsWe found evidence for both habitat segregation and interspecific interactions among small mammal species, by using low-intensity sampling across the reserve network. Thus, our sampling and analysis approach allowed for adequate assessment of the habitat associations and species interactions within a small-mammal community.
ImplicationsOur findings demonstrated the utility of this monitoring strategy and community as bioindicators for urban-reserve networks. The approach described holds promise for efficient monitoring of reserve networks in fragmented landscapes, critical as human population densities and urbanisation increase, and we discuss how adaptive sampling methods could be incorporated to further benefit conservation efforts.

T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Although most species of large reptiles in the Sydney region are now
restricted to remnant bushland, the blue-tongued lizard
(Tiliqua scincoides) remains abundant. How has this
large, slow-moving reptile managed to persist in the suburbs? We implanted
radio-transmitters into 17 adult blue-tongued lizards and tracked them for six
months (October 1998 to March 1999). Radio-tracked animals utilised 5–17
suburban backyards, but each lizard spent most of its time in a few
‘core’ areas near 2–7 shelter sites. Males had larger home
ranges than females (mean of 12700 v. 5100 m
2 ) and moved further between shelter sites. Gravid
females (mean home range 1000 m 2 ) were more sedentary.
Lizards used corridors of dense vegetation to move between retreat sites, and
actively avoided crossing roads. In sunny weather, lizards typically basked
close to their overnight shelter for 1–4 h each morning until they
obtained body temperatures of approximately 32°C. They maintained high
body temperatures while moving about in the afternoon.
In combination, the following ecological factors may facilitate persistence of
blue-tongued lizards at our suburban study sites. (i) The most important
subgroup of the population in terms of conservation are gravid females, which
are highly sedentary and, thus, less likely to encounter the dangers of
suburbia. (ii) The more ‘expendable’ males move about much more,
but mostly in times and places that involve minimal risk from humans and their
domestic pets. (iii) Lizards show strong site fidelity, spending up to
70% of their time in ‘safe’ locations; importantly, they
avoid roads. (iv) Blue-tongued lizards readily utilise
‘artificial’ shelter sites and the commensal prey species (e.g.
snails) found in most gardens. (v) These lizards can grow rapidly, mature
early, and produce large litters. Because blue-tongued lizards have a long
life span (over 30 years in captivity), populations of adults may persist for

TI  - Corporately Owned Plants need Space: An Analysis on Plant Biodiversity in Toronto’s Privately-owned Publicly Accessible Spaces
AU  - Ho, Matthew R
AB  - Abstract
          Urban plant biodiversity is a growing ecological concern for city planners and ecologists. While parks are serviced by the public sector, and yards are pruned by the private citizen, a growing proportion of urban green space is managed by corporations. Despite biodiversity targets set by city councils and public committees, actual plant surveys have not been performed. Employing coordinate data of Privately-Owned Publicly-accessible Spaces (POPS) from the City of Toronto, we sampled plant species richness in nine corporately-managed green spaces. Using linear mixed-effect models, we compared richness with various green space characteristics and found that site area is an important predictor. Our results concur with prior studies showing that habitat area may cause significant impacts to urbanized plant biodiversity.

AB  - The effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) is becoming increasingly serious in cities. Research on the adaptive planning policies for microthermal environments at the residential block level of cities is thus becoming of greater significance. Based on the cooling effect of planning control elements in residential block areas, the element effects characteristics of water bodies and vegetation distribution on the thermal environment of residential blocks were analyzed by using ENVI-met software. The simulation data analysis showed that the combination of water bodies and vegetation had a synergistic cooling effect. Based on these results, simulations of five effective adaptive measures were carried out step by step in planning scenarios, that is, improving the water bodies with vegetation corridors, the application of high-albedo material on streets, and increasing the number of green patches, east-west green corridors, and north-south green corridors. The results were as follows. First, although each of the five optimization strategies have a certain degree of cooling effect on the entire block, the superposition of each factor had a synergistic effect. Second, different spatial optimization strategies had different cooling ranges for each subzone. The optimization of the north-south green corridor, green patches, and water features corridors were particularly significant for microclimate cooling. The east-west green corridor has a certain influence on a certain range of downwind zones and had an auxiliary cooling effect. The high-albedo material also had a weak overall decrease function for the thermal environment. Finally, the downwind area of the urban creek network had a great impact on cooling intensity, with distance attenuation characteristics; it was also proposed that the comprehensive cooling effect of the green space network with optimized layout was greater than that of any single green space element. The optimization scenario planning research provided a method for improving the scientific distribution of adaptation measures in urban residential blocks.

AB  - Reasonable identification of the ecosystem security space and pattern restoration for the Yellow River Basin will be significant for facilitating future ecological protection and restoration projects. This study employs ecosystem services and landscape connectivity to discern ecological source areas and conducts an optimization evaluation method of resistance surfaces and the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model to identify the ecosystem security pattern of urban agglomeration. Then, restoration measures are proposed. The results indicate that: (1) There are 46 ecological source areas in the ecosystem security patterns of the Lanxi urban agglomeration, with a total area of 8199.249 km2. Moreover, in terms of spatial distribution, ecological source areas are sparse in the east while crowded in the west of the Lanxi urban agglomeration and are mainly composed of natural reserves, forest parks, and farmlands. (2) The ecosystem security patterns contain 914 ecological corridors with a total length of 62,970.181 km, most of which are short-distance corridors, being dense in the part of the northwest with a webbed feature. (3) The study adds 10 ecological source areas to restore the ecosystem security pattern and ecological corridors to improve the rationality of the ecosystem security pattern. Meanwhile, this study proposes restoration measures to protect the ecological environment by defining the levels of ecological security in order to provide a reference for the government to formulate policies and regulations.

AB  - Abstract
          Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners’ coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.

AU  - Sewell, Sven R.

T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Variation in bird assemblages associated with forest clearing and urbanisation
in the greater Brisbane area was assessed by counting birds in sites within
six habitat categories: large remnants, small remnants, no- understorey
remnants, canopy suburbs (original trees present), planted suburbs, and bare
suburbs. Total bird abundance and species richness were generally highest in
canopy suburbs. Individual species showed many significant abundance
differences among the habitat types, and were classified into three major
response categories: bushland species (3 in summer, 13 in winter), tolerant
species (13 in summer, 13 in winter), and suburban species (12 in summer, 11
in winter).
The commonly proposed notion that urbanisation results in lowered bird species
richness and increases in introduced species is broadly consistent with the
observed differences between bare suburbs and large remnants. However, it does
not adequately describe the situation in the planted and canopy suburbs, where
there was high species richness and extremely high abundance of some native
species (including noisy miners, lorikeets, friarbirds, and butcherbirds) but
low abundance of a majority of the species common in the original habitats
(including fantails, wrens, whistlers, and other small insectivores). Retained
forest remnants are essential for the latter group. Urban plantings of
prolifically flowering native species do not reverse the effects of
deforestation, but promote a distinctive group of common native suburban bird
species. Origins of the urban bird assemblage are discussed.

AU  - Malo, Juan E.
AU  - Mata, Cristina
T2  - Birds
AB  - Ecological connectivity among protected Natura 2000 sites is a priority for conservation in Europe due to the increasing pressure on biodiversity from human activities and climate change. Drove roads, the traditional paths used to move livestock through the territory, have been proposed as potential ecological corridors due to their large extent, continuous nature and centennial protection from ploughing and urbanization, which allows the persistence of some tree cover and natural habitats in them. Bird communities were sampled during the reproductive season along 19 drove road transects in agrarian landscapes between Natura 2000 sites, all of them around the conurbation of Madrid (Madrid Region, Spain). Bird community nestedness was assessed by NODF computation followed by significance estimation by aleatorization, and factors explaining species richness and bird abundance were analyzed through General Linear Models fitted with environmental variables measured on official vegetation maps and orthophotos. Bird communities in drove roads were significantly nested, showing high predictability in the order of species loss from better preserved sites to those under stronger environmental pressures. Accordingly, Poisson regression showed bird richness to decrease strongly with distance from the closest Natura 2000 site and to increase with forest cover at the landscape and at the drove road scales. Bird abundance increased strongly with distance from urban areas and motorways, and it was slightly higher in areas with more forest cover and in transects with less bare ground. These results, and the higher relevance detected for landscape scale variables (500 m around transects) than for those at the drove road (50 m) scale, show that (i) they can only play a secondary role as habitat for nesting birds but (ii) they may add to the Green Infrastructure strategy as facilitators or stepping stones for bird communities if the surrounding landscape is favorable for them.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion has significantly altered the regional landscape pattern, posing a serious threat to the sustainable development of natural and social ecosystems. By using landscape patterns indices and an area transfer matrix, this study analyzed the spatial-temporal changes of landscape patterns in the karst mountainous cities of southwest China from 2000 to 2020, by taking the central urban area of Guiyang City (CUAG) as the study area. This study explored the spatial and temporal driving factors of landscape pattern changes by using stepwise multiple linear regression and geographic detector methods. The results show: (1) CUAG’s landscape types altered changed drastically, with the area of forestland and construction land rapid increment and cultivated land decrement significantly. (2) The patches of construction land and forestland tended to be aggregated, the degree of fragmentation was reduced, and the shape was complex; cultivated land fragmentation was intensified. The connectivity of the landscape was improved, while the level of landscape diversity declined, the trend of landscape homogenization was obvious. (3) Socioeconomic and geographical endowment drivers have determined landscape pattern changes. The findings of this study may be used to interpret other similar landscapes worldwide and may imply the protection of urban ecosystem and sustainable development.

AB  - Impervious surfaces (IPS) are the major source of urban heat island effect (UHI), and the relationships between IPS and land surface temperature (LST) have been widely studied. However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran’s I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI), Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran’s I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.

AB  - With the accelerated urbanization and frequent occurrence of climate extremes, the regional ecosystem service level has ushered in a great challenge, and the resilience of the ecological network has gradually weakened, leading to lower ecological benefits and production levels. As a core ecologically sensitive area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan metropolitan area has been expanding outward with rapid urbanization, crowding out surrounding arable and ecological land, and facing serious challenges to the sustainable development of the national space, while current cross-regional ecological protection measures need to be strengthened urgently, and exploring the structural resilience of its ecological network is of great significance to promote regional stability. In this study, Wuhan metropolitan area is taken as an example, and we explore the evolution and laws of ecological network structure from the perspective of network analysis by constructing ecological networks in Wuhan metropolitan area in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Firstly, we select regions from the ecological control line developed in China as ecological source sites, and also select multivariate data to supplement them. Then, the ecological network was established using the MCR model. Finally, network analysis was applied to discuss the evolution of network structure under multiple times and propose corresponding conservation strategies. The results show that (1) the major ecological resistance of Wuhan urban area has increased by 5.24% in 20 years. (2) The centrality and connectivity of the network nodes have increased over the 20-year period, and the overall structure of the network has stabilized and the resilience of the network has increased. (3) There is a strong link between changes in the network as a whole and local resilience. The results of the study will help analyze the relationship between the network as a whole and the region, and provide reference for optimizing the ecological network and constructing the systematic management of ecological security pattern.

TI  - ANIMAL-AIDED DESIGN – using a species’ life-cycle to improve open space planning and conservation in cities and elsewhere
AU  - Weisser, Wolfgang W.
AU  - Hauck, Thomas E.
AB  - ABSTRACT
          Biodiversity underlies many of the ecosystem services demanded by humans. For cities, the design of ‘green infrastructures’ or ‘nature-based solutions’ has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented, given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demands modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access for humans and no human design.
          We propose ‘Animal-Aided Design’ (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.

AB  - We investigated the responses of carnivores to habitat fragmentation in urban southern California. We used scat, track, and remote camera surveys to determine presence and residence of carnivores on habitat fragments of various sizes (4.4-561.0 ha) and degrees of isolation (10-750 m). Fragment area explained a significant portion of the variation in all four measures of species richness (total species present, native species present, total species resident, and native species resident). Isolation was of secondary importance and was significant only for species presence. We suggest that fewer carnivore species at smaller or more isolated fragments resulted from foraging decisions based on lower food reward in smaller fragments and greater movement costs for more distant fragments. Carnivore species responded differentially to fragmentation. Bobcats Lynx rufus were fragmentation-sensitive and apparently required large fragments, thus they may be useful as focal species for conservation planning. In contrast, Coyotes Canis latrans were more fragmentation-tolerant and, along with smaller species such as Northern Raccoons Procyon lotor, Striped Skunks Mephitis mephitis, and Virginia Opossums Didelphis virginiana, can persist in smaller fragments. Our results suggest that most of the common carnivores can persist in fragmented urban habitat, provided that fragments are sufficiently large and in close proximity.

AB  - Urban expansion has resulted in the fragmentation of green spaces. Based on the concept of a living community that integrates mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, and grasslands, the extraction of key elements in green spaces of regional ecosystems provides core scientific support for the ecological restoration of territorial spaces. According to the ecological service function importance and ecological sensitivity, the ecological sources were identified in this study. Furthermore, we distinguished the ecological corridors using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and identified the key areas of green spaces using the circuit theory model. The result showed that (1) 62 ecological sources were present with a total area of 4696 km2, of which green space accounted for 98.19%; meanwhile, 151 ecological corridors (optimal path) were densely distributed in the southwest region around the Daimao and Bopingling mountains. (2) The key areas of ecological restoration in the study area included 17 key ecological sources and 19 key ecological corridors. The area covered by ecological pinch points was 1327 km2, among which 77.54% of green space comprised forest area. The area of ecological barriers was 9647 km2, and the forest area still accounted for the highest proportion (63.92%). (3) Based on a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution of key areas of ecological restoration and green spaces, we formulated classified ecological restoration measures. The study findings are expected to provide a reference for planning the ecological restoration of territorial spaces.

T2  - Journal of Field Ornithology
AB  - Urban development often results in removal, fragmentation and degradation of woodland habitat. A 2-yr breeding bird census was conducted at two urban, forested wetlands in Staten Island, Richmond County, New York, to evaluate the influence of development on bird species composition. Bird species composition at the Richmond Creek site, a habitat fragment surrounded by development, was dominated by non-forest, urban-resident and human-attracted species. The Latourette Park site, located within a wooded parcel in the Staten Island Greenbelt, supported significantly more forest-interior and human-intolerant species. The two sites did not differ significantly in the number of migrant or resident bird species. The study indicates that forest islands in New York City can provide nesting habitat for area-sensitive bird species, but development that encroaches upon or degrades these habitats promotes the urbanization of the forest bird community. /// El desarrollo urbano a menudo resulta en la remoción, fragmentación y degradación de habitats forestados. Por dos años se condujeron censos de aves en dos anegados forestados urbanos del Condado de Richmond en Staten Island, New York, para evaluar la influencia del desarrollo en la composición de especies de aves. La composición de aves en un habitat fragmentado, rodeado por desarrollo urbano en Richmond, fue dominado por aves típicas de lugares no forestados, residentes de áreas urbanas y aves atraídas por actividades de humanos. Una localidad del Parque Latourette, localizado en una parcela forestada de Staten Island, albergó un número significativamente mayor de aves usuales del interior de bosques y de poca tolerancia hacia el humano. Las dos localidades estudiadas no difieren significativamente en lo referente a especies residentes o migratorias. El estudio indica que las "islas de bosques" en la ciudad de New York pueden proveer de habitat de anidamiento para especies de aves sensitivas, pero el desarrollo que usurpa estas áreas o degrada el habitat promueve la urbanización de la comunidad de aves de bosques.

AB  - Conservation authorities invest heavily in the restoration and/or creation of wetlands to counteract the destruction of habitat caused by urbanization. Monitoring the colonization of these new wetlands is critical to an adaptive management process. We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario’s eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN),
              Chelydra serpentina
              , and Midland Painted (MP) turtle,
              Chrysemys picta marginata
              ) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding’s turtle (
              Emydoidea blandingii
              ) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding’s turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding’s turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations. The genetic data suggest that the turtles probably belong to a remnant local population. We discuss the implications of our results for connectivity of artificial wetlands and the importance of the whole wetland complex to this turtle assemblage.

AB  - Plant species conservation relies on their reproductive success and likelihood of population persistence. Knowledge of plant mating systems, particularly the relationship between plants and their pollinators, is fundamental to inform conservation efforts. This knowledge could be critical for prioritising efforts in human-dominated fragmented landscapes such as the world’s biodiversity hotspots, where reproductive success can be compromised due to habitat loss, limited access to pollinators or other factors. Yet, fundamental data on plant mating systems are lacking for many Australian plants. Here we determined the mating systems of native plant species growing in native woodland fragments within Perth’s urban landscape in south-western Australia. We manipulated insect access to flowers and pollen transfer on five locally common native species, then observed floral visitors and examined reproductive success. Hemiandra pungens and Patersonia occidentalis had mixed mating systems with some ability to self-pollinate, whereas Dianella revoluta and Jacksonia sericea were reliant on insects for outcross pollination. The fruits and seeds produced by Tricoryne elatior were too low to draw conclusions about its mating system. The introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the sole visitor to the mixed mating species, whereas native bees visited D. revoluta and J. sericea (one bee species each). Overall, our data suggest that D. revoluta and J. sericea are more vulnerable to fragmentation than H. pungens and P. occidentalis. Although insects contributed significantly to the reproductive output of the two former plant species, our observations suggested low frequency and richness of insect visitors to these urban fragments. More research is required to determine the generality of our findings. A comparative study in larger native woodland fragments would help estimate the effect of fragmentation on insect pollinators and consequences for the insect-reliant plant species.

T2  - Journal of Agricultural Engineering
AB  - The issue of the fragmentation of natural habitats is increasingly at the core of the scientific debate, but often not taken into due consideration in planning tools, with particular reference to the dynamism and complexity of landscapes. As it has been recognised at a European level, in order to allow different species to remain in good functional status, a network of green infrastructures should be implemented. The concept of <em>ecological</em> <em>island</em> is no longer sufficient to protect adequately the fauna and the ecosystem it lives in. Consequently, ecological islands must turn into ecological networks. The ecological connectivity refers to the way habitats are physically connected to each other and how easy it is for species to move in. Good ecological connectivity is fundamental to the effective conservation of biodiversity considering that most species and ecological functions provided by ecosystems (ecosystem services) require a much wider space than that available within the boundaries of a single protected area. The main objective of this paper is to critically compare the application of a dedicated model for the design of ecological networks to two very different environmental contexts. This model was first tested in a Mediterranean area (the province of Reggio Calabria) in 2008 and updated in 2010. The main goal was to integrate the traditional (physiographic and functional) approaches into the design of ecological networks by taking into account biological and orographic elements as well as the anthropic structure of the territory. In 2011, within the ECONNECT European project, the same model was applied to the Pilot region of South- Western Alps (including the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur and the Italian regions Piedmont and Liguria), which is one of the richest transnational districts in Europe in terms of biodiversity. In such a region, the issue of multidisciplinary ecological connectivity was tackled in order to provide a series of proposals aiming at the development of the ecological potential of the area. The two applications allowed to further investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented model by integrating its validation also by means of information on faunal presence, which obviated one of the major limitations occurred in the first application.

AB  - While most previous research has been conducted in large urban parks, the potential of small parks as urban habitats remains largely unexplored, particularly in tropical regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide landscape architects, planners, park managers and municipalities with recommendations for planning, design and management with the aim to enhance small urban parks’ biodiversity. Physical characteristics, vegetation and human factors are the important features that were highlighted using empirical data from nine small urban parks in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia sized between 0.5-3.5 hectares. Birds and butterflies are used as ecological indicators because they are relatively easy to identify and show clear responses to environmental change. Pearson’s correlations and multiple regressions, followed by an analysis of the Akaike’s Information Criterion were conducted to study the relationships between the measured variables, and to identify which of the variables have a significant effect on bird and butterfly species richness and abundance. The results demonstrate that the percentage of canopy cover, park size and native vegetation are the best predictors of bird species richness and abundance. Meanwhile, the butterfly species richness and abundance can be best predicted by the percentage of canopy cover, shrub species and native vegetation. Based on these results and the identification of key features for bird and butterfly richness and abundance, nine recommendations are provided to improve biodiversity of small urban parks: (1) set minimum areas for a small urban park; 2) inclusion of water elements to support a wider range of species; (3) the application of internal patch-corridor-matrix features; (4) attention to the aspect of cleanliness and appearance of small parks; (5) the proportion of open and shaded areas; (6) the planting composition of trees, palms and shrubs should be designed not only with aesthetic functions, but also for biodiversity; (7) the vertical and horizontal layers of vegetation structures; (8) providing natural buffers for wildlife protection; and (9) creating unmanaged patches in sunny areas by using wildflowers.

AB  - Amphibians constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biósfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Intertransect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health.

T2  - Bulletin of Insectology
AB  - Culex pipiens L. (Diptera Culicidae) is of medical and veterinary importance as vector of various bacterial, filarial and arboviral disease pathogens, and is a major pest in urban areas. Understanding the population structure and gene flow among populations is critical for public health issues such as local dispersion pattern and spread of insecticide resistance. To determine the dispersion pattern of the Cx. pipiens samples across the southern part of the Pannonian Plain of Central Europe (testing Isolation by distance model), and at fine-scale level, between ecologically different larval habitats (testing Isolation by ecology model), we studied hexokinase (HK) genes. Because the polymorphism of HK genes is independent of insecticide use, spatial variation at HK loci provided valuable information on population connectivity of Cx. pipiens. Implementing STRUCTURE statistical analysis, a lack of structuring at individual level of “urban” and “rural” samples was observed. Landscape study rejected both ecological and isolation models which implies that different selection regimes of larval habitats and geographic distance do not influence on genotype portioning at HK system. Observed high genetic connectivity among samples throughout urban and rural environments indicated that gene flow is an important factor underlying genetic structure. This study pointed out that control measures restricted to urban areas are unlikely to be effective due to high gene flow between treated and untreated populations. Hence, designing a sustainable vector control strategy for the species with detectable gene flow, such as Cx. pipiens, must remain a regional effort.

AB  - In heterogeneous landscapes, physical barriers and loss of structural connectivity have been shown to reduce gene flow and therefore lead to population structuring. In this study, we assessed the influence of landscape features on population genetic structure and gene flow of a semiaquatic species, the muskrat. A total of 97 muskrats were sampled from three watersheds near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. We estimated population genetic structure using 11 microsatellite loci and identified a single genetic cluster and no genetic differences were found among the watersheds as a result of high levels of gene flow. At finer scales, we assessed the correlation between individual pairwise genetic distances and Euclidean distance as well as different models of least cost path (LCP). We used a range of cost values for the landscape types in order to build our LCP models. We found a positive relationship between genetic distance and least cost distance when we considered roads as corridors for movements. Open landscapes and urban areas seemed to restrict but not prevent gene flow within the study area. Our study underlines the high-dispersal ability of generalist species in their use of landscape and highlights how landscape features often considered barriers to animal movements are corridors for other species.

TI  - A core on the Atlantic margin of Europe: an urban bird assemblage in Cork City, Ireland
AU  - Luscier, Jason D.
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization threatens bird populations globally, however many urban habitats present important refugia for wildlife in this rapidly changing landscape. Additionally, birds at the periphery of their global range are more prone to landscape changes and thus these distributions are good indicators of the effects of urbanization on diversity; e.g., bird populations and communities of Cork City, Ireland. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects from urbanization on bird densities (birds/ha), species richness, and species composition throughout Cork City. I surveyed 32 points selected with a stratified random sample within commercial areas, residential habitats, and green spaces throughout Cork City during four breeding seasons between 2016-2019. Species richness was highest in green spaces with 18-34 species; whereas residential habitats had 14-27 species and commercial areas had 9-20 species. The most densely populated species citywide were rock pigeons (5.4-9.1 birds/ha), Eurasian jackdaws (2.9-3.8 birds/ha), rooks (4.5-6.4 birds/ha), European starlings (3.4-5.3 birds/ha), Eurasian blackbirds (2.4-3.6 birds/ha), and house sparrows (2.7-4.5 birds/ha). Overall a lack in urban green space surrounding survey points was most strongly associated with reduced species richness and population estimates. Also, both species richness and population densities tended to be higher in regions with less noise pollution and farther from the urban core. Ultimately these results corroborate other studies stressing the importance of urban green spaces for conserving biodiversity in cities. This is particularly important for the birds of Cork City given that these urban habitats are at the western edge of these species’ distributions.

AB  - Abstract
            Sustainable land-use planning should consider large-scale landscape connectivity. Commonly-used species-specific connectivity models are difficult to generalize for a wide range of taxa. In the context of multi-functional land-use planning, there is growing interest in species-agnostic approaches, modelling connectivity as a function of human landscape modification. We propose a conceptual framework, apply it to model connectivity as current density across Alberta, Canada, and assess map sensitivity to modelling decisions. We directly compared the uncertainty related to (1) the definition of the degree of human modification, (2) the decision whether water bodies are considered barriers to movement, and (3) the scaling function used to translate degree of human modification into resistance values. Connectivity maps were most sensitive to the consideration of water as barrier to movement, followed by the choice of scaling function, whereas maps were more robust to different conceptualizations of the degree of human modification. We observed higher concordance among cells with high (standardized) current density values than among cells with low values, which supports the identification of cells contributing to larger-scale connectivity based on a cut-off value. We conclude that every parameter in species-agnostic connectivity modelling requires attention, not only the definition of often-criticized expert-based degrees of human modification.

AB  - The UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) Agenda 21 issue for sustainable development emphasizes on an integrated approach for the maintenance and management of land resources. Conservation of biodiversity has become an important environmental issue after the UNCED. Habitat fragmentation caused by the sprawl of urban development is becoming one of the major environmental problems in the Metropolitan suburbs in Japan. The conservation of vegetation areas from urban development as well as creating more such areas has become an essential thought for today for preserving the biodiversity since vegetation area is the remaining habitat for wild-animals and wild-plants. In landscape ecological point of view, the size and distribution pattern of the vegetation patches that has become wildlife habitat and especially the strength of connectivity between such patches are important factors.

T2  - The Herpetological Journal
AB  - On Jersey (British Channel Islands), common toads often reproduce in small, urban ponds. This atypical breeding strategy has implications for their persistence and they have declined on the island in recent times. We used polymorphic microsatellite markers to compare genetic diversity in Bufo bufo from five different ponds in Jersey with two populations from north-west France. Genetic diversity of Jersey toads was comparable with that of populations elsewhere in Europe. Numbers of breeding female toads in Jersey were correlated with pond area but estimators of genetic diversity were unrelated to pond area or female numbers. Fst estimates and isolation by distance tests indicated that there is little gene flow between breeding sites on the island. Jersey populations last shared a common ancestor with those of north-west France long before the island’s physical separation about 6000 years ago. Toads have a long history in Jersey and were once probably very numerous there. The average effective historical population size of Jersey toads is estimated to be 15,000–16,000. Although genetic diversity of Jersey B. bufo is currently quite high, recent developments on the island may threaten this situation in the near future.

TI  - Conservation of Wet Meadow Species in an Urban Context: Lychnis Flos-Cuculi as Study Case
AU  - Van Rossum, Fabienne
T2  - Belgian Journal of Botany
AB  - In urban areas, wetland habitats consist of small isolated remnants, embedded in an inhospitable human-used matrix, and incurring strong anthropogenic pressures (e.g., artificialization, pollution, eutrophication, and exotic species invasions). These can lead to detrimental genetic and demographic consequences for the populations, even for common species. This study investigated genetic variation and structure for 12 allozyme loci and reproductive fitness in populations of Lychnis flos-cuculi (Caryophyllaceae), an insectpollinated perennial herb occurring in wetland fragments and along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium), in relation to population size. No effect of population size on genetic variation and usually low between-population genetic differentiation were found for urban populations of L. flos-cuculi. A significant pattern of isolation by distance indicated that beyond a certain distance, especially along the Woluwe, populations might still exchange genes. Floral display and fruit set increased with population size, but this relationship did not seem to be predominant. Significant differences found among populations suggest that other factors (e.g., plant density, neighbour competition and habitat quality) may have a stronger impact on reproductive fitness. Some of the small populations may also be still connected through pollen flow, increasing reproductive success and preventing inbreeding depression. The present findings suggest that populations of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone are not prone to the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation, as we may have expected, despite the relative small size of the populations. These genetically diverse and productive populations can still be considered of conservation value, including the small ones, which within a certain spatial distance might be regarded as important connecting components of pollen-exchanging network of populations, buffering populations against the negative effects of small population size. The conservation of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone should favour the preservation of connected populations rather than only preserving isolated wetlands.

AB  - This research implements a GIS framework model aimed at evaluating the ecological efficiency of urban green areas. The model classifies urban green areas by identifying those that can provide ecosystem services to sustain green infrastructure at an urban district level. This model can also guide decision makers in the proper placement of the green infrastructure. The model works on the interrelation of four indicators of size, shape, vegetation structure and vegetation diversity, and it was tested in the case study of the Western Urban Districts of Naples (Italy). The selection of this study area is because it presents four urban districts that are different for physiography, urban patterns, land use, land cover and for the existing building stock. The proposed GIS-based framework can be a useful tool for planning actions and measures to protect, implement and restore existing green areas through integration into urban green infrastructure.

TI  - Bats and the City: Urban Bat Biodiversity in a Tropical Biome Transition Zone
AU  - Syme, Peter
AB  - Urbanisation is an important factor in global land-use change which dramatically alters habitats at great detriment to wildlife. Our understanding of urban biodiversity patterns and their driving factors in tropical cities which interact with high levels of biodiversity is limited, yet it is pivotal to developing efficient and effective conservation guidelines for urban planning. This study uses a long-term data set (>10 years) of species occurrence records, collected as part of a public health monitoring scheme within the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil to quantify the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of bats in the city for each year and season of the study period. Linear regressions were then carried out to test whether the different facets of diversity show any significant trends over the study period. Moreover, a habitat suitability analysis for the five most common species was conducted using the MaxEnt algorithm, following the framework of Bellamy et al. (2013), and the most important factors affecting the presence of these species were identified. It was found that there was a significant increase in bat taxonomic diversity over time, however, functional and phylogenetic diversity remained unchanged over the period of 2004-2014. Maps of habitat suitability were produced for each focal species. Human population density and distance to natural resources, such as water and forest bodies, were important variables for all species modelled. The information gained from this study can be used to aid the development of effective bat conservation strategies and guidelines within the urban environments of southern Brazil.

T2  - New Zealand Journal of Ecology
AB  - Most non-native weeds and other naturalised plants are in the early stages of invasion into New Zealand landscapes. For this invasion to be controlled, even partially, it is important to understand the dominant routes, mechanisms, and rates of weed spread across landscapes. With their linear corridors of disturbed habitats, roadsides are thought to play a large role in the spread of some weeds. We used both new surveys and existing data to assess which of the 328 environmental weeds listed by the Department of Conservation are most frequently found on roadsides, where, and whether distribution patterns are consistent with linear dispersal. We also analysed historical survey data for relationships between reserve weediness and proximity to roads. We surveyed 340 plots of 100-m-long stretches of roadside across four regions and found between 2 and 19 environmental weeds per plot; 128 species in total (Chao estimate 148). Especially abundant were agricultural species (weeds and cultivated), species that have been naturalised for well over 50 years, and species that disperse externally attached to vertebrates. While we purposefully sampled within 10 km of town limits, we found no strong effect of distance from town on roadside weed richness, including richness of just ornamentally sourced weeds. Instead, number of houses within 250 m and presence of an adjacent house or other residential structure were both important, as was presence of woody vegetation on and adjacent to roadsides. Reserves adjacent to roads had significantly higher weed richness than reserves further from roads, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. Our results suggest that while roadsides include suitable habitats for most environmental weeds, distributions are patchy and roads show little sign of acting as linear dispersal corridors, instead largely reflecting neighbouring land uses. As such, roadside weeds should best be managed as part of the wider landscape.

AB  - Abstract Sourcing plant species of local provenance (eco-sourcing) has become standard practice in plant-community restoration projects. Along with established ecological restoration practices, knowledge of genetic variation in existing and restored forest fragments is important for ensuring the maintenance of natural levels of genetic variation and connectivity (gene flow) among populations. The application of restoration genetics often employs anonymous ‘fingerprinting’ markers in combination with limited sample sizes due to financial constraints. Here, we used two such marker systems, AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and ISSRs (inter-simple sequence repeats), to estimate population-level genetic variation of a frequently used species in restoration projects in New Zealand, mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus, Violaceae). We examined two rural and two urban forest fragments, as potential local source populations, to determine whether the māhoe population at the recently (re)constructed ecosystem at Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, reflects the genetic variation observed in these four potential source populations. Both marker systems produced similar results and indicated that, even with small population sizes, levels of genetic variation at the heritage park were comparable with in situ populations. However, the AFLPs did provide finer resolution of the population genetic structure than ISSRs. ISSRs, which are less expensive and technically less demanding to generate than AFLPs, may be sufficient for restoration projects where only a broad level of genotypic resolution is required. We recommend the use of AFLPs when species with a high conservation status are being used, due to the greater resolution of this technique.

endemic to saltmarshes in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Population sizes of
Belding’s Savannah Sparrows show a positive relationship with saltmarsh area, but few large wet-
land fragments remain within their range in California. Belding’s Savannah Sparrows are sensitive
to fragmentation and isolation, with small isolated marshes acting as population sinks. In addition,
this subspecies shows low genetic variability, limited dispersal, and small effective population sizes.
Light-footed Clapper Rails are habitat specialists, found in marshes with good tidal flushing that sup-
port California cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) habitats. Light-footed Clapper rails also show low genetic
variability and limited dispersal and the remnant populations of clapper rails are relatively isolated
from one another. Large wetland complexes may serve as population sources for both species, while
small, isolated marshes may act as population sinks but more research is needed to estimate and
model the dynamics of these two metapopulations. Mitigation for wetland loss and restoration proj-
ects should not be evaluated simply by presence of rare bird species alone, but instead efforts should
be made to determine population sustainability

TI  - The movements of small mammals within the environmental mosaic of a railway junction
AU  - Hicklenton, David Mark
AB  - This study investigated small mammal movements within and between semi isolated habitat islands. The results are relevant to urban small mammal species in general and their movements in relation to man-made barriers in particular. The study site was a railway junction consisting of railway tracks of different widths, dissecting an area of relict grassland in an otherwise urban environment.For two years the small mammals in this area were trapped, marked and recaptured. They were also tracked using dyed bait markers and a grid of dropping boards from which were recovered faeces containing remains of the dyed bait. The ability of the small mammals present (Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis) to cross the railway lines was correlated with weight and sex; and also related to the width of the railway track and the vegetation on either side.Conclusions were reached concerning the distribution and behavioural ecology of the three species within the study area, particularly in relation to the animals' capabilities for movement within heterogeneous habitats.The biogeography of small islands such as these was considered, with reference to the effects of size and isolation on mammal movements. The effect of population density on such movements and possible local migratory effects were also investigated. The implications for conservation were discussed and it was shown that information from fieldwork such as this can aid biogeographical analysis in reserve design (for conservation of urban mammal populations) and aid in urban planning.

TI  - The impact of riparian habitat quality on the activity of british bats in lowland river systems, and its relevance to conservation management
AU  - Scott, Sarah Jane
AB  - Rivers and their associated floodplains are natural wildlife corridors used by a wide range of animal species. Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas. The composition of the riparian zone and floodplain habitat affects the foraging and activity of riparian specialist British bats and should be considered when designing landscape-scale conservation schemes that include British rivers.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Asian Longhorned Beetle in Worcester, MA: Thermal Effects, Community Responses, and Future Vulnerability
AU  - Elmes, Arthur Francis Marett
AB  - Urban environments experience air, water, noise, and heat pollution as a consequence of their composition, structure, and function. These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB,  Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This dissertation investigates three elements of the ALB infestation of Worcester, providing a holistic explanation of the impacts, recovery, and vulnerability of Worcester’s urban forest.

TI  - Plant migration along freeways in and around an arid urban area: Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Gade, Kristin Joan
AB  - General ecological thought pertaining to plant biology, conservation, and urban areas has rested on two potentially contradictory underlying assumptions. The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to "pristine" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not. Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert. In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists. The case study reveals the need for collaboration throughout the stages of design, construction and maintenance in order to efficiently manage roadsides for multiple priorities.

TI  - Ecological network planning method and case study : a case study in chongming island, china
AU  - Guo, Ji Guang
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAlong with the process of urbanization, the development of natural and the reconstruction strengthen the changes in the city pattern. Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building. The inadequacies of this paper is the only goal is to protect the animals. The future combination of cultural, aesthetic, human demand for open space to study the network

TI  - Loggerhead Shrike Detectability and Occurrence in Coastal South Carolina Urban Areas
AU  - Krauser, Michelle
AB  - Grassland birds, such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), are threatened by extensive land-use change, including urbanization. Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal.	In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.

TI  - Bee Community Response to Local and Landscape Factors along an Urban-Rural Gradient
AU  - Birdshire, Kristen R.
AB  - Over a third of the world’s crops—including fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, and oilseed—require insect pollination. Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.

TI  - Forest Structure Shapes Tropical Terrestrial and Arboreal Mesomammal Communities Under Moderate Disturbance
AU  - Masseloux, Juliana
AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly forest degradation and overhunting. Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior. Mean occupancy was underestimated for most semi-arboreal species when only one method was used. Multi-method occupancy designs may thus improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use, which are important for guiding management and conservation decisions.

TI  - The Influence of Land Use and Habitat Fragmentation on Landscape Connectivity
AU  - Gray, Morgan
AB  - The built environment, especially roads, urban and suburban development, can reduce the ability for wildlife to move across landscapes. Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers. Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.

AU  - McGuckin, Christopher P.
AB  - A spatial distribution model was developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model was validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared to the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity.The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.

TI  - The importance of biodiversity in private gardens relative to public green spaces and the synergistic effects of garden connectivity
AU  - Sperling, Corinne D.
AB  - Urban ecology, or the study of relationships among plants, animals and humans in cities, is an interdisciplinary science. It integrates issues of environmental concern, for example, biodiversity and ecological health, with the practices of a sample of urban dwellers. Private backgardens and public urban green spaces (parkettes) in the Greater Toronto Area were sampled and compared with respect to plant diversity and environmental heterogeneity. With a greater number of microhabitats and higher plant species richness than public parkettes, private backgardens were found to be remarkable hotspots of biodiversity and environmental heterogeneity. A backgarden microcosm experiment looked at the interaction of structural features of backgardens and the incidental recruitment of invertebrates, seeds, and plants. These small supplements of space served as habitats for recruitment of plants and seeds as it was determined that invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment and above-ground vegetation growth were enhanced regardless of soil or grass substrate treatment in microcosms. Backgarden characteristics, specifically the number of woody plants (trees and shrubs) and the number of plant species significantly predicted seed recruitment and winged invertebrate visitation, respectively, to microcosms. Lastly, a spatial analysis evaluated local and regional green space composition and heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Nearly 74% of the Greater Toronto Area is comprised of green space, however, more than 50% is made up of low vegetation (i.e., grass and herbaceous ground cover). Approximately 8% of the urban landscape was appraised as private backgardens; 6% of the urban landscape, conservatively, was estimated as backgarden green space. The percent green space composition of backgardens differed between neighbourhoods, and based on different human population densities, while neighbours were found to be statistically similar in their backgarden percent green space composition. This research study thus promotes citizen science and ecological practices within backgardens to enhance urban biodiversity and regional green space connectivity.

In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes. First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis  sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of  Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that  Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors. In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.

TI  - Genetic and Morphological Variation of Butterflies in Relict Habitats
AU  - Crawford, Lindsay Ann
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss are leading threats to global biodiversity and can alter patterns of dispersal, population dynamics, and genetics with implications for long-term species persistence. Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.

TI  - Urban macrostructure and wildlife distributions: Regional planning implications
AU  - Stenberg, Kathryn
AB  - Urban environments can satisfy the habitat requirements of a variety of wildlife species. It has been shown that urban residents enjoy wildlife near their homes. The goal of this study was to determine if urban wildlife distributions could be predicted by metropolitan planning variables, so that opportunities for urban residents to enjoy wildlife near their homes could be enhanced.Three hundred one random points, stratified into seven zones, based on intensity of urbanization and vegetation type, were chosen in the Tucson metropolitan study area. Birds were censused with the variable circular plot method. Sign of selected mammal species were searched for at a subset of these points.Native bird species diversity declined steadily as housing density increased. The study area still supports a high diversity of native species because of the high levels of natural open space still found intermixed with residential development. The amount of land covered in residential development and the amount of paloverde-saguaro vegetation types with associated riparian areas were the best predictors of native bird species diversity. The data also suggest that plant cover created by man-maintained vegetation is not as attractive to native bird species as naturally occurring vegetation.Ground nesters and insectivores tended to drop out at higher housing densities while seed-eaters were retained. Three patterns of avian response to variables describing the intensity of urbanization and the amount of natural vegetation emerged: urban, suburban, and exurban.Native Sonoran desert birds appear to be highly sensitive to urbanization, as minor increases in residential housing densities lead to declines in diversity. Mammal species appear to be most sensitive to the size of open space areas and fragmentation and isolation of natural lands.Metropolitan planning processes may be limited in their ability to retain high species diversities. The impacts of urbanization on wildlife diversities may be mitigated through sensitive open space planning.

TI  - Beyond drawing the line: A study of the edge structure Boston's Emerald Necklace
AU  - Vankina, Priyanka
AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of patches and corridors which are formed by hills, different soils types, vegetation patchiness, natural disturbances and human activities. As humans have developed, the patches and corridors have become fragmented and edges have been created. These edges become the critical points of interaction for wildlife with their surroundings. This is especially true in urban areas where development has created harsh edge environments.   \This study investigates the edge structure of Olmsted's Emerald Necklace to understand how edges can be designed to create habitat for wildlife in urban areas. The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones.  The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways. These include protecting existing habitat, using native plants and eradicating invasive species. The results and findings are discussed in further detail. Overall the Emerald Necklace is ecologically healthy and provides functions for both people and animals.

TI  - The conservation status of urban and urban fringe woodlands in Nottinghamshire
AU  - Sanders, I.
AB  - Many of the criteria used to evaluate natural ecosystems for wildlife conservation are not applicable or must be modified for use in the urban environment. The reasons for this relate both to the different roles which conservation can fulfill in built up areas, compared to the rural countryside, and to the unique ecology of the urban environment. The ecology of a major component of this environment, the urban forest ecosystem is described in detail. The studies of the conservation status of the woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation were carried out to establish which are the most important sites for nature conservation and how they compare to the best sites in the Country of Nottinghamshire. The studies of conservation status use those criteria which are considered to be applicable to the urban environment and by other different criteria to which numerical values are easy to assign. The woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation form a representative but degraded series of the main woodland types occurring in the County of Nottinghamshire. Although, many of the urban and urban fringe woodland exhibit features which give them county importance few of the woodlands in the Greater Nottingham conurbation have any legislative conservation status. The use of `social' criteria, e.g. proximity, educational use, recreational value and position and linkage of sites, for the conservation evaluation of urban woodlands is discussed. In the quantified assessment of conservation status many of the urban and urban fringe woodlands are comparable to the best woodlands of the Country with respect to species richness and plant rarity. However, the regression analysis used in this investigation only showed significant relationships where a large number (20 or more) of sites were compared. Only the relationship between site area and species richness was considered as valuable in the ranking of woodland sites in order of conservation value. The results are discussed in relation to the ecology of the whole urban forest ecosystem and to management implications. Certain areas within the Greater Nottingham conurbation lack woodland habitats, e.g. the central parts of the City of Nottingham and parts of Gedling and Rushcliffe and these are seen as important areas for woodland habitat creation. Future management of the woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation should follow a carefully designed conservation strategy taking into account the critical factors of disturbance, fragmentation and isolation to ensure the conservation of this ecosystem.

TI  - The study of associations between Maryland's amphibian species and habitat parameters at local and landscape scales
AU  - Walz, Anita
AB  - The relationship between amphibians and their surrounding habitat was examined at local and landscape levels. Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment. Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness. Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority. The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent. Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others. Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size. In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes. After hypothetical riparian zones were added, connectivity increased with greater improvements in landscapes of lower initial connectivity.

TI  - Using Population Genetics to Examine White-Tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) Connectivity across Multiple Spatial Scales: Influences of Proximity, Landscape, and History
AU  - Gardner Almond, Lynne Carol
AB  - Understanding the degree to which population connectivity is influenced by social structure, movement patterns, and management actions is important for development and evaluation of the impact of wildlife management strategies on wild game populations. I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations. My results suggest that, despite their high vagility and habitat generalist nature, social structure, landscape characteristics, and management history all impact genetic structure of white-tailed deer populations at multiple spatial scales.

TI  - What Is the Potential to Increase Local Biodiversity in Semi-Urban Amenity Grasslands Through Meadow Constructions?
AU  - Östberg, Alexandra
AB  - The loss of biodiversity worldwide and methods of prevention are hot subjects receiving increased interest in todays’ research. Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses. Further research is needed to investigate other factors possibly affecting suitability of grasslands for meadow construction.

TI  - Effects of Urbanization on Bat Habitat Use in the Phoenix Metropolitan Region, Arizona, USA: A Multi-Scale Landscape Analysis
AU  - Bazelman, Tracy C.
AB  - Context – Urbanization can have negative effects on bat habitat use through the loss and isolation of habitat even for volant bats.  Yet, how bats respond to the changing landscape composition and configuration of urban environments remains poorly understood.Objective – This study examines the relationship between bat habitat use and landscape pattern across multiple scales in the Phoenix metropolitan region.  My research explores how landscape composition and configuration affects bat activity, foraging activity, and species richness (response variables), and the distinct habitats that they use.Methods – I used a multi-scale landscape approach and acoustic monitoring data to create predictive models that identified the key predictor variables across multiple scales within the study area.  I selected three scales with the intent of capturing the landscape, home range, and site scales, which may all be relevant for understanding bat habitat use.Results –  Overall, class-level metrics and configuration metrics best explained bat habitat use for bat species associated with this urban setting.  The extent and extensiveness of water (corresponding to small water bodies and watercourses) were the most important predictor variables across all response variables.  Bat activity was predicted to be high in native vegetation remnants, and low in native vegetation at the city periphery.  Foraging activity was predicted to be high in fine-scale land cover heterogeneity.  Species richness was predicted to be high in golf courses, and low in commercial areas.  Bat habitat use was affected by urban landscape pattern mainly at the landscape and site scale.Conclusions – My results suggested in hot arid urban landscapes water is a limiting factor for bats, even in urban landscapes where the availability of water may be greater than in outlying native desert habitat. Golf courses had the highest species richness, and included the detection of the uncommon pocketed free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops femorosaccus).  Water cover types had the second highest species richness. Golf courses may serve as important stop-overs or refuges for rare or elusive bats. Urban waterways and golf courses are novel urban cover types that can serve as compliments to urban preserves, and other green spaces for bat conservation.

TI  - Population dynamics and occupancy patterns of Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) in New York City parks and adjacent suburbs
AU  - Nagy, Christopher M.
AB  - Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) are one of the few raptor species that permanently reside in New York City (NYC).  To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls.  Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis.  Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY.  These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks.  I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates.  I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events.  Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15.  Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2.    In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT.  Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009.  Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point.  These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists.  Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural.  The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC.  I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate,  and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC.  In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas.  I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park.  Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%.  I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration.  It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles.        In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus).  Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes.  However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.

TI  - Conservation Genetics and Ecology of the Hazel Dormouse
AU  - Combe, Fraser
AB  - Woodland species face a challenging future because of human activity and global climate change, as such it is vital to understand the ecology of species that inhabit these habitats in order to conduct effective conservation management. I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species. I discuss the implications for hazel dormouse conservation in the UK, and make recommendations for conservation practitioners to ensure the future persistence of this species.

TI  - Investigating the small public urban open spaces at high-density cities: a case study of hong kong
AU  - Lau, Hiu Ming
AB  - Many researches have shown that urban parks can enhance the quality of life, which is a key factor of building a sustainable city. Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors. Based on all the investigations and findings, suggestions have been made to improve the quality of SPUOS in Hong Kong.

TI  - Spatial movements and ecology of mountain lions in southern Arizona
AU  - Nicholson, Kerry Lynn
AB  - Managing wildlife in urban areas is increasingly necessary for wildlife conservation. Large carnivores like mountain lions ( Puma concolor) present a particular challenge to managers because of public safety and the polarizing emotional reactions to human-lion encounters. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment. Preserving movement corridors for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining landscape connectivity to ensure viable populations adjacent to urban areas. Because mountain lion habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona and lions traverse large landscapes, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences their life history characteristics and ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study was to examine the ecology and spatial movements of mountain lions surrounding urban areas. We studied habitat selection, urban use by mountain lions, spatial movements and overlap, genetic relatedness, feline disease, and ectoparasites of mountain lions in southern Arizona.

TI  - Status and Conservation of the Grass Snake in Jersey
AU  - Ward, Robert John
AB  - Global biodiversity losses are being driven by anthropogenic pressures; the most pervasive of which is habitat loss resulting in fragmentation and population isolation. These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.

TI  - Greenspace conservation planning framework for urban regions based on a forest bird -habitat relationship study and the resilience thinking
AU  - Kato, Sadahisa
AB  - The research involves first conducting a “case study” of ecological data and applying the results, together with the resilience concept, to the development of a greenspace conservation planning framework for urban regions. The first part of the research investigates the relationship between forest bird abundance and the surrounding landscape characteristics, especially, forest area and its spatial configuration in urban regions at multiple scales. The results are similar for simple and multiple regression analyses across three scales. The percentage of forest cover in a landscape is positively correlated with bird abundance with some thresholds. Overall, the percentage of forest cover in the landscape, contrast-weighted forest edge density, and the similarity of land cover types to forest cover are identified as important for the conservation of the target bird species. The study points to the importance of species-specific habitat requirements even for species with similar life history traits and of maintaining some forest edges and/or edge contrast.

TI  - Process Oriented Infrastructure for Climate-Driven Forest Migration Through Cities
AU  - Han, Qiyao
AB  - Global climate change is expected to shift the geographical distribution of tree species worldwide. Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.

TI  - Do Open Spaces Provide Refuge for Anurans Within an Urban Matrix?
AU  - Hutto, David Ruple, Jr.
AB  - Urbanization is among the largest threats to amphibian populations through habitat fragmentation, isolation, and outright destruction. Urban open spaces, such as parks and golf courses, have the potential to provide amphibians with suitable habitat within an urbanized matrix. During the spring and summer of 2018, I conducted dip net surveys and active call surveys to determine the presence and abundance of anurans at 51 wetland sites within the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina. Nearly one-third of these wetlands were located within urban open spaces, while the others were situated along a rural – urban gradient. Impervious surface and road density surrounding the wetlands were measured at a core habitat scale (300 m) and average maximum migration scale (750 m). Urban Open Space wetlands were found to have levels of impervious surface similar to High Urbanization wetlands at the larger scale and were intermediate between Low and High Urbanization wetlands at the smaller scale. Road densities were higher at Urban Open Space wetlands at both scales compared to Low and High Urbanization sites. Species richness decreased as impervious surface and road density increased among all wetlands. Wetland category was not a significant driver explaining species richness, but β-diversity was higher among Urban Open Space wetlands than either Low or High Urbanization wetlands. I also evaluated species-specific relative abundances as a function of wetland type (Urban Open Space, High Urbanization, or Low Urbanization), several within-wetland variables and two landscape-scale covariates. No species were influenced by wetland type, however impervious surface had a negative influence on the abundance of one species whereas road density negatively affected three species of anurans. Urban Open Space wetlands did not appear to increase suitability for anurans relative to urban wetlands, instead showing higher variability in species composition; perhaps attributable to the diversity among sites represented in the Urban Open Space category. Conservation efforts conducted within open spaces should attempt to focus on issues not only at an individual wetland scale, but also at larger scales surrounding the open spaces themselves. Understanding how urbanization at various spatial scales effects anuran species can bolster amphibian conservation efforts in urban matrices.

TI  - Pond -breeding amphibians in a highly modified landscape: Habitat modeling, landscape genetics, and predictions of landscape change
AU  - Goldberg, Caren S.
AB  - In the second half of the 20th century, landscape change on the terrestrial surface of the Earth occurred at an unprecedented rate, leading to habitat loss and degradation for thousands of species. Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values. These results emphasize the need for species-specific data to inform management and conservation planning, and also contribute to a growing body of work on the landscape associations and multiple dispersal strategies of pond-breeding amphibians globally.

TI  - Ecological evaluation on and plant disposition characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai
AU  - Wang, Ping Xu
AB  - Based on theoretical analysis and argumentation, comprehensive principles for evaluating the green land of parks and the plant disposition were established, including high biodiversity, harmonious intra-species and interspecies relationship with reasonable ecological structure, multiple functions of ecological service, harmonious human-nature relationship, and the self-maintenance, self-adjustment, self-cycling, self-renewal, self-perfection and self-upgrading. Seven principles were put forward for evaluating the plant disposition, including paying attentions to the habits and interspecific relationship of plants, spatial disposition of plants, temporal disposition of plants, aesthetic effects of plant disposition, comprehensive application of pose, texture, color, aroma, sound, light and so on, humanities and artistic conception, and the harmony between plants and other landscape elements.According to the field investigations in the green lands of 80 parks in Shanghai, and the theoretical analysis, the characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai was discussed, which included the following aspects: the inheritance of plant disposition techniques of classical Chinese gardens, the absorption of advanced theories of modern western parks, the contemporary developments in the design of green lands of parks in Shanghai, and the scarcity of animal biodiversity. As to the third characteristic, the developments referred to the increase of plant biodiversity, the changes in life form spectrum, and the diversity of ecological structure and functions. The flora and species composition of trees, the frequency of commonly used trees and the applications of native trees in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were analyzed. The composition of native species in the green lands of parks in Shanghai according to families and genera was analyzed and compared with those in the whole area in Shanghai. The current situation of life form spectrum in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed and compared with that in the regional vegetation in Tiantong National Forest Park. The variety of structure and function of plant disposition in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed in terms of  tree height, light and soil requirements, resistibility to poisonous air. To solve the scarcity of animal biodiversity, some suggestions for the attraction and protection of wild animals were put forward, and the disposition of bird plants and nectar plants in the community were recommended.Some ecological countermeasures for the future development in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were discussed. Parks as the pool of biodiversity and the place for animal, plant and microbe to rest, reproduce, assembly and diffuse, should act as nodes of urban landscape ecosystem, so as to maximize the ecological effects at the scale of urban landscape ecosystem. Outside the parks, the other green lands in the city should serve as the corridors between the landscape nodes, the biodiversity patches.

TI  - A study on urban circle: spatial scale analysis and evolution
AU  - Du, Juan
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs a complicated system, the urban spatial structure is influenced by natural, social and economic factors on its formation and development. By making use of modern information technology and the multiple-discipline-crossing method to research spatial distribution of all component elements of the urban spatial structure and interrelationship and interaction among these elements in space and time, in different spatial scales, it can provide scientific basis and technical support for building organic urban spatial structure and formulating appropriate development strategies, which is very significant to maintain sustainable urban development. Due to above-mentioned significance, this paper systematically analyzes characteristics and evolutions of the spatial structure of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales through modern information technology and by establishing effective methods to analyze the urban spatial structure, and acquires major research results as following: (1)On the basis of describing concepts, component elements and scale compositions of the urban spatial structure, commenting on urban spatial structural modes, and summing up quantitative research methods of urban spatial structure in different spatial scales, it establishes the hierarchical analytical method of urban spatial structure, which is based on remote sensing image and can be used in different spatial scales, according to the relationship between remote sensing image and geographical spatial information. This method explains distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and connectivity of areas covered by this information by extracting urban thematic information from multi-source remote sensing image, defining multiple distribution modes for thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and constructing topological structure diagram made up of areas covered by urban thematic information and ways to connect these areas. (2)On the basis of analyzing characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data and qualitative and quantitative concepts involved in applying these characteristic to urban research, it realizes extraction of urban thematic information based on remote sensing image through extraction and quantification of concepts about urban building and vegetation coverage in remote sensing image by using the cloud model, which can be used to converse qualitative concepts into quantitative expression. It proves that this method is effective to extract urban thematic information through precision comparison with the maximum likelihood method. During researching distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information, it recognizes distribution modes of thermal environment of urban thematic information through quantitative definition, and also analyzes characteristics and reasons of distribution of thermal environment of urban thematic information according to recognized results. (3)On the basis of discussing evolution rules of urban spatial structure, it analyzes application superiority and range of modern information technology in the research of evolution rules, and also describes change patterns of urban spatial structure and quantitative analytical method. Besides, it further analyzes characteristics and evolution of Wuhan urban road network by introducing into the complex network theory, mapping the urban road network, which represents the basic framework of urban spatial structure, as complex network, and using statistical characteristics parameters of complex network. (4)This paper systematically analyzes spatial structure and evolution of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales by using multi-source remote sensing image and various research methods. A number of suggestions have been proposed according to the above anaylsis results. Within the spatial scale of urban circle, it adopts models of economic relation intensity and strength to divide spatial levels of Wuhan urban circle, and also incorporates the complex network theory to analyze network characteristics of constructed economic relation network of urban circle. Besides, it uses the fractal theory to analyze spatial fractal characteristics of the urban system of Wuhan urban circle from two aspects, namely, rank-scale structure and spatial distribution. In addition, it makes use of MODIS remote sensing image and the hierarchical analytical method to research spatial structural characteristics of Wuhan urban circle. Within the city-wide spatial scale, it performs qualitative analysis to change patterns of Wuhan urban spatial structure since 1949, and also uses two-period TM/ETM+ remote sensing images and corresponding social and economic data to perform quantitative analysis to changes of time and space during 1991-2002, and further compares changes on distribution modes of thermal environment in areas covered by urban buildings and urban and rural topological structure diagrams of these two periods. Within the spatial scale of main city zone, it adopts the landscape index method to analyze composition and spatial allocation of urban greenland landscape pattern in the main city zone, and also uses ASTER image and the hierarchical analytical method to research distribution characteristics and connectivity of thermal environment through extraction of urban greenland in the Wuhan main city

AU  - Chen, Hua Shui
AB  - Studies on bird community patterns and processes in Hangzhou heterogeneous urban landscape habitats (urban woodlots, street tree strips, western mountain, ecotone and wetlands etc.) were carried out during 1997 ~ 1999. The main results are as follows:1. 150 species were recorded.Based on sensitivities to urbanization and edge, and distributing in how many kinds of habitat, they were divided into 12 urban landscape habitat distributional guilds.2. The distributions of birds over urban woodlots were nonrandom. There was imperfect nested subset pattern in community assemblages. The heterogeneity between woodlots was the cause of the departure from perfect nested subset pattern.3.The species-area relationships of woodlot bird communities were the results of action of multi-factors, which included: the effect of different sample size (under the same sample size, the small woodlots have higher species density than large one), the habitat diversity (the diversity of tree species was the uppermost influencing factor), disturbance factors, species factors and the effect of different research scales etc.4. There were substantial turnover and distinct seasonal changes in woodlot bird communities. The overall stability of woodlot bird community was low. 5. Street tree strips had extensive ecological functions, they served birds not only as the roosting and feeding sites, but also the corridor of movement.6. The characteristics of distributions of bird communities from the edges of the city zone to the forest interior were misty. Species number, diversity and abundance had a great fluctuation along the linear space. They were correlated with the random distributions of heterogeneous features in western mountain.7. Edge effect could result in not only increasing of diversity, but also decreasing of diversity, it depended on the characteristics of the edge. Edge effect was transformable in time.8. With urban expansion, rare and interior species, waterbirds and insectivore declined. Meanwhile,some species showed limited adaptation to urbanization.9. Landscape habitats were correlative in space, and the factors influencing communities usually be at different scales. The diversity at definite scale correlated nearly with the heterogeneity at a definite scale.10. Urban bird community in Hangzhou was cognized as a landscape metacommunity. It possessed three characteristics: 1)  The habitat was landscape habitat composed of multi-patches; 2) All local communities were correlative and interdependent; 3) There were individual flows between local communities.

Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.

TI  - Predicting the consequences of human disturbance, urbanisation and fragmentation for a woodlark lullula arborea population
AU  - Mallord, John W.
AB  - Woodlarks Lullula arborea breeding on fragmented heathlands in Dorset, southern England are at risk from the potential threats of habitat fragmentation, urban development and recreational disturbance.  The density of woodlarks was lower on sites with higher levels of disturbance, a result of suitable habitat not being settled by breeding birds.  A model of territory occupancy predicted that the impact of increased access on the population depended on both the extent of the increase and the spatial distribution of people.  However, birds on more disturbed sites had greater density-dependent reproductive success, which operates at all stages of the breeding cycle, including recruitment into the local breeding population.  A multiple-brooded species, the woodlark showed a mid-season peak in clutch size.  Other breeding parameters showed no seasonal trend.  However, chicks that fledge from early nests were more likely to be recruited into the breeding population that those from late nests.  As with other ground nesting species, predation was the main cause of nest failure.   The degree of urban development around a site determined the distribution and abundance of woodlarks on heathland.  Urbanisation operated by reducing the amount of off-site foraging habitat, and as a source of human disturbance.  In addition, although the species favours patchy, ephemeral habitats, the degree of isolation from other woodlarks also affected the likelihood of a site being occupied.  Although disturbance is affecting woodlarks, the population is likely to be limited by the availability of suitable habitat.  This will require sympathetic heathland management, understood within a landscape context to ensure success in maintaining the woodlark population.

TI  - The effect of urbanization on butterfly species diversity
AU  - Di Mauro, Desiree Kay
AB  - This dissertation investigates the impacts of urbanization on butterfly diversity in Washington, DC, northern Virginia, and Maryland and the role of butterfly gardens in butterfly conservation. Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.

TI  - Integrating Social, Political, and Economic Factors into Spatial Models of Grizzly Bear Conflict and Connectivity
AU  - Spragg, Shannon
AB  - The rapid expansion of the global human footprint is forcing humans and wildlife to share more space. There is rising concern over human wildlife conflict and its effects on human and animal wellbeing. Investigation into the biophysical and social landscape features that shape conflict or how spatial patterns in conflict ultimately affect species’ movement or survival is limited. Characterizing landscape connectivity and identifying potential movement corridors is a key conservation strategy, but is challenged by the fact that many wildlife species navigate a mosaic of infrastructure, available habitat, land uses, and political boundaries. In this thesis, I investigated the social and biophysical factors that contribute to conflict with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and how this conflict may impact connectivity for bears across southern British Columbia and northern Washington. I selected this system due to its rich cultural history with grizzly bear biological and social complexity. The region has current grizzly bear populations, extirpated areas, state/provincial and international boundaries, diverse land uses, and a variety of social values towards wildlife. I used two resource selection approaches to first determine the probability of conflict reporting across all wildlife species, and then to determine the probability of bear conflict specifically. First, I used presence and background sampling in combination with Bayesian logistic regression to identify important predictors of conflict across species using 5,606 reported instances of conflict and 8,703 background points. Then, I fit a second regression treating 2,062 bear conflict occurrences as presence points and 3,544 instances of other conflict as absences to characterize how bear conflict might differ from wildlife conflict in general.I found that predictors of conflict differed between species and that the probability of general wildlife conflict was substantially different than the probability of bear conflict across the study system. The strongest predictors of conflict for all species were human population density and both livestock and row-crop operation density. The strongest predictors of bear conflict were public opinion of bears, proximity to existing grizzly bear populations, and suitable bear habitat. Generating spatial predictions on these models indicates that the urban centers of the Okanagan (e.g., Kelowna, Vernon) are hotspots for general wildlife conflict while the semi-urban and rural agriculture landscapes (e.g., outside Penticton and along the US and Canada border) are hotspots for bear conflict (Chapter 1). I then incorporated spatial predictions of the probability of bear conflict into the resistance surface for a connectivity model across the traditional territory of the Sylix people to investigate how spatial patterns of conflict may impact bear movement and the ability to recolonize the traditional Sylix territory. I used Omniscape to model connectivity as a function of biophysical variables to identify the most likely available movement pathways and compared this to model outputs that incorporated the probability of conflict into the resistance surface to determine the effects of conflict on grizzly bear connectivity. My research highlights the role that social and institutional variables play in conflict and how these effects may differ between species. Further, my results illustrate the potential for conflict to constrain wildlife movement and highlight the need to treat connectivity conservation as a socio-ecological issue rather than just an ecological one.

TI  - Aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of lowland rural and urban ponds in Leicestershire
AU  - Hill, Matthew J
AB  - Ponds are common and abundant features in nearly all landscapes typical of European lowland landscapes yet research on freshwater biodiversity has traditionally focussed on larger waterbodies such as lakes and rivers. This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.

TI  - Biodiversity and population persistence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in fragmented urban habitats.. (BL: DXN068471)
AU  - Small, E.C.
AB  - Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites.  Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats.  Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors.  At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken.  A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted.   The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species.  Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate.  A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists.  These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation.  Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.

TI  - The distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape
AU  - Lintott, P. R.
AB  - Urbanisation is a key driver in the loss, fragmentation and modification of natural habitats resulting in the global loss of biodiversity. As the human population, and consequently the rate of urbanisation, continues to increase exponentially it is important to understand how to sustain and enhance biodiversity within the built environment. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet relatively little is known of how its composition and spatial configuration can influence species presence or foraging activities. It is therefore necessary to examine habitat use and biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales to fully understand how species are responding to the urban matrix. There are few other orders of animals that are as strongly associated with people as bats (Chiroptera); for some bat species human habitations provide roosts and adaptations of the environment provide food sources. However bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation indicating that many species are not able to persist in highly urbanised areas. In this thesis, I show that the behaviour, habitat preferences, and distribution of bats are strongly influenced by the built environment at both a local and landscape scale. Although many animal species are known to exhibit sex differences in habitat use, adaptability to the urban landscape is commonly examined at the species level without consideration of potential intraspecific differences. I found that female Pipistrellus pygmaeus show greater selectivity in foraging locations within urban woodland in comparison to males at both a local and landscape scale. There was a lower probability of finding females within woodlands which were poorly connected, highly cluttered, with a high edge: interior ratio and fewer mature trees. The results have important implications for our understanding of how to manage areas for breeding females and highlight the need to supplement acoustic monitoring with trapping data to assess sex differences in habitat use. Determining how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The morphological similarities between P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus suggest that both species should respond similarly to the urban matrix, however I found differential habitat use occurring within a variety of urban habitats (e.g. woodland and waterways) and at a landscape scale. In urban woodland there was a higher probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats yet we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. After surveying urban waterways throughout the UK, I was able to show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of bat species from the riparian zone up to 3km from a waterway. This indicates that beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales, from retaining a vegetated riparian zone at the local scale to highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes that encompass the entire urban matrix. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species such as bats. I was able to demonstrate a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency (e.g. the use of an acoustic lure to increase bat-capture rate) and a significant relationship between bat activity and the relative abundance of certain species of bat which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area whilst minimising wildlife disturbances. Urbanisation has also had strong negative effects on many insect groups, such as moths, which are important components of the diets of many bat species. I found that woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscapes in determining the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages within urban woodland. This indicates that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be more beneficial for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. The findings presented in this thesis have important implications for our understanding of the adaptability of species to the built environment and for the management and monitoring of bat populations. It also highlights that even common bat species are negatively affected by urbanisation and much greater attention should be paid to securing their future within the urban landscape.

TI  - Understanding the Effects of Fox Movement on the Spread of Sarcoptic Mange in Urban Settings: An Individual-Based Modelling Approach
AU  - Dimitrov, Nikol
AB  - The threat of disease spread to humans is greater in urban settings where contact between wildlife and human populations occurs frequently. Movement of host species plays a key role in maintaining transmission of direct-contact disease. Understanding how wildlife hosts move in fragmented urban landscapes is therefore imperative for disease control efforts. In cities, disease spread can be affected by the ability of a host to move through urban features, or by behavioural changes that are pathogen induced. Using the urban-adapted red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its associated disease sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in the city of Toronto, I ask: How does movement of foxes according to landcover type affect the spread of mange? And how does variable movement of susceptible and infected foxes influence mange transmission? These questions are addressed using an individual-based modeling approach, where two movement behaviours of foxes in a city are compared: random and least-cost path. To assess the effects of movement ability according to disease status (here, susceptible-biased, and infected-biased movement), I compare a range of movement probabilities. For each scenario, the number of effective contacts and the effective reproduction number (Re) are estimated. Findings suggest that mange spread may be accelerated when movement is based on landcover types and when there is equal movement ability of susceptible and infected foxes. This study emphasizes the importance of including realistic movement behaviours when modelling the dynamics of mange and disease spread in urbanized landscapes.

TI  - Study on the Frameworks, the Functions and the Landscape Ecology Planning Methods of Urban Green Corridors―A Case Study of Wuhan
AU  - Cai, Jing Chan
AB  - As an important aspect of landscape ecology, the studies on corridors are permeating urban ecology and urban landscape planning. Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied.  This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is   meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than   meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than   meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than   meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors. The results show that Wuhan’s all kind of green corridors in each district, especially the green belts, are very scanty. The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.

TI  - Relationships between spatial configuration of tropical forest patches and diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in northeastern Puerto Rico
AU  - Galanes Rivera, Ileana T.
AB  - A primary goal of landscape ecology is to reveal the relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns. Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.

TI  - Multi-Scalar Drivers of Native Bee Community Composition and Population Genetic Structure in Human-Altered Landscapes
AU  - Ballare, Kimberly Michelle
AB  - One of the most well-documented ecological impacts of human-caused landscape change is the fragmentation of natural habitats by human infrastructure, with potential implications for 1) community composition, and 2) species-level gene flow patterns. By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.

TI  - Solutions to spatial and computational challenges for large-landscape conservation planning
AU  - Leonard, Paul Brandon
AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a fertile scientific discipline capable of examining global natural resource threats including land cover conversion, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region.Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable.Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species.  I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles.  Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions. Although the increasing threats to biodiversity conservation are well documented, strategies such as those presented here may help facilitate positive conservation outcomes.

TI  - Influences of adjacent land-use on avian community structure in sub-boreal peatlands of the Midwest
AU  - Wandrie, Lucas J.
AB  - Surrounding land use influences avian community structure; moreover, anthropogenic manipulation of habitat can alter bird species richness and composition. In the first chapter of my thesis work, I conducted avian surveys at 20 sub-boreal peatlands in eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin to detect correlations between land development and bird community structure. Peatlands are wetlands that accumulate decaying organic plant material (peat) and provide valuable and diverse habitats to a variety of flora and fauna. I measured urban and cropland development at three spatial scales (500 m, 1000 m, and 2500 m radii). Effects of development on avian communities also were assessed with respect to distance from a major metropolis using three zones: counties inside the city (metro), counties immediately adjacent (collar), and rural counties adjacent to the collar (fringe). I predicted that the zone with intermediate levels of disturbance would have greater species richness (intermediate disturbance hypothesis) and that there would be a correlation between differences in community species composition (i.e., species turnover) and increased levels of development. Urban development influenced avian communities more than agricultural development and avian communities were different among the zones in species composition and partly in species richness. Statistical analysis identified negative relationships between urban cover and the proportion of human intolerant species at all three spatial scales. In the second chapter of my thesis work, I created a rapid-assessment model of habitat quality designed to detect relationships of landscape variables such as peatland area, degree of isolation from other wetlands, extent of adjacent economic development, and vegetative structure on bird community composition. I used rapid-assessment model, known as a hydrogeomorphic model (HGM), that numerically combines landscape features to predict the value of habitat to bird species diversity (functional capacity) Following HGM procedures, I predicted functional capacities at 20 sub-boreal peatlands When compared to observed species diversity, however, no relationship was found with predicted diversity levels. Of the model variables only vegetation structure was related to bird diversity. I suggest that a new model needs to be developed in order to assess the value of peatlands to support peatland bird communities.

TI  - Landbird demography and community structure along an urbanization gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin
AU  - Schlesinger, Matthew Daniel
AB  - Urbanization has profound effects on biodiversity, but few studies have addressed the consequences of multiple stressors along urbanization gradients on both populations and communities. I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.

TI  - Nomadic Animal Movement and Infectious Disease in Changing Landscapes
AU  - Teitelbaum, Claire Stewart
AB  - Animal movements are an essential component of individual fitness and population dynamics, and also affect species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.

TI  - Avian Communities and Ecoacoustics in a Tropical Human-Modified Landscape
AU  - Bradfer-Lawrence, Tom
AB  - Large areas of the tropics have been cleared of forest and converted to agriculture. The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.

TI  - Critical Effects of Urbanization on a Charismatic Carnivore: Genetic Change, Disease and Toxicant Exposure, and Disease Susceptibility in Bobcat Populations in an Urban, Fragmented Landscape
AU  - Serieys, Laurel Elizabeth Klein
AB  - Urbanization has profound ecological impacts that reach beyond city boundaries. Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.

TI  - Water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in ponds across an urban land-use gradient in birmingham, u.k
AU  - Thornhill, Ian
AB  - The ecology of ponds is threatened by urbanisation and as cities expand pond habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. Pond communities are structured by local (water quality, physical) and regional (land-use, connectivity) processes. Since ca1904 >80% of ponds in Birmingham, U.K., have been lost due to land-use intensification, resulting in an increasingly diffuse network. A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels. The results indicate that many urban ponds are threatened habitats that require active management to protect and restore water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Creating Useful Road Mortality Models: Identifying Drivers of Road Mortality at Different Resolutions in the Greater Toronto Area
AU  - MacFarlane, Stephen Sohier
AB  - Road propagation has led to landscape level threats due to habitat destruction, pollution, and mortality. Road mortality risk prediction converges on three drivers: habitat availability, landscape connectivity, and traffic volume. This study assessed the relative importance of mortality drivers in a peri-urban landscape at different taxonomic levels. Road mortality data and land cover data were provided by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, and traffic data from governmental sources were used. I modelled landscape connectivity using circuit theory algorithms. Driver significance was assessed using univariate multiple regression models and multivariate redundancy analyses, using total road mortality, taxa-based road mortality, and species level road mortality for American toads and grey treefrogs. Local scale drivers such as wetland patchiness and amount had the greatest effects on road mortality. Greater divergence occurred at the species scale, though conserved patterns were seen across multiple taxonomic levels.

TI  - Urban wetland structure and its relationship to exotic plants, biodiversity, and West Nile Virus risk
AU  - Shappell, Laura Jean
AB  - Wetlands provide crucial ecosystem functions that aid water security, stormwater management, and biodiversity conservation. However, the underlying mechanisms that influence headwater wetlands in urban landscapes are poorly understood. Further, biodiversity loss may reduce ecosystem function and increase the transmission risk for some enzootic diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). My research aimed to: 1) assess wetland vegetation structure and the importance of fragment size and landscape position on biodiversity; 2) test the importance of flooding conditions for mitigating invasive plant dominance in forested wetlands using Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) as my study system; and 3) identify relationships between vegetation structure, fragment size, and the relative abundance of competent avian WNV hosts and mosquito vectors. I used a combination of measurative and experimental research methods to address these objectives, the third of which was part of a collaborative interdisciplinary research grant. Vegetation structure was measured in 36 plots located in six forested wetlands and data loggers were used to monitor aboveground flooding. Avian and mosquito research teams coordinated  iii with my sampling points. My results illustrate the capacity for urban headwater wetlands to support a diverse flora, as well as the complex interactions between human activities and wetland structure and function. Red maple, oak, sweetgum, and green ash were the dominant tree species. Half of the 287 plant species identified only occurred at 1-2 sample points. Groundcover composition reflected the confluence of hydrogeomorphology, and past and present human actions. Connectivity via nearby streams or ditches had a greater impact on exotic plant richness than did wetland patch size. Aboveground flooding prior to seedling emergence significantly reduced the distribution of Japanese stiltgrass. Avian species richness was positively correlated with plant richness. In contrast, mosquito richness was negatively correlated to plant richness. WNV hosts and vector abundance both increased with maple (Acer spp.) tree canopy dominance. Cumulative host abundance averaged 24% and was composed primarily of American Robin, which showed large interannual shifts in fragments <15 ha. The relative abundance of competent vectors ranged from 5 to 26% and their populations demonstrated less interannual variation than were observed in the host populations.

TI  - The river in the urban landscape: Landscape ecological principles for the design of riverfronts
AU  - Penteado, Homero M.
AB  - River corridors have become important resources for the preservation of nature and habitat restoration of because they remain a continuous natural feature within urban landscapes. This study develops riverfront design principles to enhance habitats and species diversity, restore hydrological processes, and provide opportunities for human activities. The design principles are developed from an assessment of literature on waterfront design and landscape ecology, and a case study that integrates ecological and human concerns. The resulting principles were applied to a riverfront in Guelph, Ontario, to illustrate and understand their usefulness. Mitigation and restoration measures could be applied to enhance the ecological function of the riverfront. The principles were applied to re-establish the lost connectivity by enhancing vegetation on the riverbanks and part of the floodplain, and by removing barriers. In some sites, the principles could not be applied because of the presence of buildings. Their removal would represent a costly initiative and a loss of cultural landmarks. The design principles are considered useful for designers and planners because they have the potential to equip professionals with tools to establish and create healthier natural systems, while addressing human needs in riverfront environments.

TI  - Genetic structure in Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus): An assessment using multiple markers
AU  - Caballero, Isabel C.
AB  - This thesis explores mating system, effects of reintroductions, and worldwide population structure of the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus). The following chapters are based on a set of questions focused on different spatial and geographical scales, making use of nuclear and mitochondrial data to address these questions.Chapter 1: This chapter focuses on why birds make good subjects for these kinds of studies, why genetic data is used to reveal geographical patterns in widespread species, and the use of genetic data to validate subspecies designations. I present case studies highlighting the use of both mitochondrial DNA, the marker of choice for phylogeographic studies, and nuclear markers, which are used in population and landscape genetics. I describe my study species, the Peregrine Falcon, a cosmopolitan top-order predator which has faced several ecological and human generated factors that shaped population distribution and stability.Chapter 2:  I investigate the breeding and dispersal patterns in urban-dwelling reintroduced Midwestern Peregrine Falcons using molecular tools. Data for eleven microsatellite DNA markers, including eight newly developed for the species, were gathered from a total of 282 chicks and 68 additional birds from nine Midwestern cities representing 20 nest sites, with most extensive sampling from Chicago. I found high nest site fidelity, long-term mate fidelity, and two instances of extra-pair paternity. Field observations suggest that males preferred to breed close to their natal site, but this behavior left no clear genetic signal. My results are in accordance with previous findings for other raptors that genetic monogamy is the rule and nest site fidelity is frequent.Chapter 3: This chapter starts with an historical review of the extirpated Midwestern Peregrine, the nature of the recovery and how the reintroduced population successfully recovered. Samples included museum specimens ( n= 32, collected 1881-1963) representing the Midwestern-Eastern historical population, and contemporary samples (n=80, collected 1986-2009) from the recovered urban Midwestern population. I detected differences in levels of genetic diversity for both periods. Average observed heterozygosity was significantly lower for the historical population while haplotype and nucleotide diversity were significantly higher for the historical population. Bayesian clustering analysis of microsatellite data revealed a genotypic shift between historical and contemporary populations. The cause of this shift is likely the result of the use of non-native stock in the recovery process. Chapter 4: I found genetic differentiation among populations, and similar levels of genetic diversity across regions. Microsatellite data separate Western Peregrines into three distinct genetic clusters: (i) Channel Islands and Southern California; ii) Northern California and Oregon; and iii) Washington. These genetic patterns were concordant with previous ecological modeling studies. My results do not support the hypothesis that different management techniques have left an imprint on these recovered populations, but there is genetic structure consistent with the original groups on which management plans were focused.Chapter 5: This chapter focuses on understanding how Peregrines evolved such a wide-ranging distribution and how changes in migratory behavior or breeding dispersal have led to the formation of a distinct population structure. Two alternative hypotheses of range expansion and colonization are considered, Isolation by Distance, and Suspension of Migration. Genetic results based on 11 microsatellite loci show low to medium degree of genetic differentiation among northern hemisphere Peregrines while significant differentiation was observed between northern migrants and southern residents in both Old and New World. Mitochondrial control region data reveals a similar picture with lack of differentiation between northern Peregrines and significant differentiation between northern and southern populations.

TI  - Relative Habitat Use, Occupancy, and Species Richness of Bats across the Gradient of Urbanization in an Arid Region
AU  - Dwyer, Jessie M.
AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver of ecological change and occurs across a gradient from low- to high- density development. Wildlife species can exhibit different responses to urbanization, with some species being more sensitive than others. Further, wildlife communities can exhibit varying patterns of species richness across the gradient of urbanization, where species richness can either decrease linearly or peak at intermediate levels of urbanization, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). For chapter one, the objective was to evaluate the response of bats to urbanization across seasons. It was predicted that bat species would exhibit different responses to urbanization and that bats would increase use of urbanized areas in the summer season, where food and water resources were assumed to be greater. For chapter two, the objective was to evaluate species richness of bats across the gradient of urbanization in the summer season. Species richness of bats was predicted to either decrease linearly or peak at moderate levels of urban intensity. To test these hypotheses, 50 sites across the gradient of urbanization were sampled during four seasons using stationary acoustic bat monitors. Fourteen bat species were identified during 1000 nightly occasions. Consistent with chapter one predictions, bat species exhibited different responses to urbanization, with most bats being sensitive to urbanization. Counter to predictions, most bats did not appear to shift their response to urbanization across seasons. However, two bats (i.e., big brown bat and Yuma myotis) exhibited higher use of urbanized areas in the summer compared to other seasons. Consistent with chapter two predictions, species richness of bats decreased with increasing urban intensity. Results from this study demonstrate that most bats in the community were sensitive to urbanization, which is potentially related to species traits and has important conservation implications. First, it is likely important to maintain high-quality undeveloped habitat with low anthropogenic disturbance in wildland areas for species that are sensitive to urbanization and to maximize species richness. In addition, for bats that are tolerant of urbanization and to increase species richness in urbanized areas, it is likely important to preserve resources in urbanized areas and increase landscape connectivity.

TI  - Small mammal communities and functional connectivity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley: A landscape perspective
AU  - Dolman, Richard William
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity, negatively affecting all major taxonomic groups. To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use. My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat. Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.

TI  - Ecological Restoration and Landscape Design of the River Connecting Yangchun Lake and East Lake in Wuhan
AU  - Zhang, Yuan Si
AB  - As one of the most important ecological corridor, river has deep influence on bio-diversity, energy transferring, water recycle, etc. The urbanization undertaking in many cities in China has caused serious ecological crisis, especially in water ecology and water environment security. City lakes and rivers, polluted by large-scale manmade construction, are facing problems such as eutrophication, loss of wildlife habitats, and excessive reclamation, etc. On the other hand, the urban space, devoured by commerce, residence, office buildings, etc., is lack of public open space. With living standard improving, green space in city is needed more and more. Based on such background, the project is due to study the river ecological restoration and recreational development. According to the general urban planning of Wuhan in 2020 and the East Lake water system restoration planning, this project chooses the site between East Lake and Yangchun Lake. The site is in the urban-rural ecotone and is now facing the problem of urbanization. It has serious contradiction between ecological security and urban construction. The project is focused on dealing with the contradiction and combining ecological restoration and recreation together.Among the many elements influencing eco-system in the site, I focus on transportation because large traffic not only has very deep influence on wildlife habitats, physical environment and vegetation distribution, but also brings with manmade construction and urban development. So take control of transportation is to some extent limit the urbanization of this site. The project plans a wetland system to control the impact of traffic and turns the adjacent area of freeway into a recreational wetland park.

AB  - Las áreas metropolitanas han experimentado un crecimiento exponencial en las últimas décadas, especialmente en los sectores periurbanos. La literatura ha descrito este proceso de "expansión urbana" como un fenómeno que está cambiando el paisaje por el incremento en el consumo del suelo, que a su vez ha originado un proceso de conurbación con los territorios y centros poblados aledaños, a modo de un crecimiento desbordado que ha llegado a sobrepasar los límites político-administrativos.Esta investigación, que se encuentra dentro del marco del proyecto Fondecyt- ANID/Chile Nº 1180268 y la beca Senescyt-Ecuador, para estudios de Doctorado convocatoria 2015, toma como caso de estudio Quito y su área de expansión urbana, bajo la visión de dos componentes: lo urbano y sus dinámicas funcionales y la modelación de su crecimiento. Plantea una nueva configuración metropolitana: la movilidad entre asentamientos humanos localizados en diferentes circunscripciones territoriales que, a su vez, permiten la configuración de corredores urbanos y la integración del territorio.También analiza los cambios de uso del suelo que se han producido en Quito y su área metropolitana en un período de 19 años, producto del crecimiento urbano, para lo cual utiliza herramientas y aplicaciones tecnológicas como los sistemas de información geográfica SIG, percepción remota y modelación. Además, y como componente principal, se determinan las fuerzas motrices impulsoras del crecimiento urbano, las demandas, restricciones y como principal entrada la consulta a los stakeholders, todo esto mediante el uso del modelo Dyna-CLUE para la creación de escenarios futuros al 2050. Estos escenarios de simulación urbana consideran una visión holística de las dinámicas de cambio de uso de suelo junto con las políticas de planificación; este caso de estudio anticipa cómo la expansión urbana consumirá áreas agrícolas y naturales, en un claro proceso de deterioro que en su mayoría es irreversible.El nuevo enfoque propuesto en esta investigación, permite plantear recomendaciones que ayuden en la planificación de las ciudades y reorienten las políticas públicas para lograr ciudades más inclusivas, sustentables y resilientes.

TI  - The effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in Southern California
AU  - Alonso, Robert Scott
AB  - Habitat destruction and degradation is a serious threat to biodiversity, and urbanization and road development are driving factors in habitat loss. As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores.  In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes.  In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.

AU  - Gressler, Benjamin Paul
AB  - The fisher (Pekania pennanti) was found throughout Pennsylvania prior to the mid-1800s but were extirpated due to habitat loss and overharvest. The species was reintroduced in 1996 into Pennsylvania following New York and West Virginia in 1967 and 1983, respectively. A sampling of genetic material and point locations of these and other fishers began in 2002 across Pennsylvania and were used to discern source populations using 12 microsatellite loci.For my thesis, I used this dataset to develop gene flow and movement models within the Isolation by Resistance theory framework. The models were built and validated using a training and testing set method with 70% and 30% of the sample points, respectively. Two results that need investigation is the role of rural development as a positive factor for fisher movement and gene flow and possible movement corridors near Scranton, PA and the Kittatinny Ridge in south eastern Pennsylvania.

AU  - Frederick, Teresa Moore
AB  - I surveyed songbirds and lizards adjacent to dry rivers throughout metropolitan Tucson and related species richness to recreational use and habitat using stepwise multiple regression. Habitat characteristics included vegetation structure and floristics in river-edge areas, adjacent land uses, and land uses of the surrounding landscape.Bank stabilization had a negative effect on species richness of all bird groups. Total vegetation cover, mesquite (Prosopis velutina) density, and natural open space had a positive effect on species richness of most bird groups. Tall vegetation was important for species richness of lizards.River corridors could function as conservation corridors for five bird species and two lizard species. However, habitat for many other species was not continuous across the metropolitan area.Recommendations include protecting mesquite bosques without bank stabilization, protecting wide areas of upland vegetation near large protected areas, and increasing structural diversity and use of native plants in river parkways.

TI  - Mammalian carnivores, mesopredator release, and avifaunal extinctions in a fragmented system
AU  - Crooks, Kevin Robert
AB  - Habitat fragmentation has been identified as a primary threat to biodiversity, and mammalian carnivores are thought to be particularly vulnerable to extinction in fragmented habitat. Further, the disappearance of dominant predators from fragmented systems may result in the ecological release of smaller carnivores and increased predation on small prey species, a process termed “mesopredator release.” I first examine the effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of mammalian carnivores in scrub habitats in coastal southern California. My results suggest a combination of landscape biogeographic descriptors (fragment area and isolation), local habitat variables (percent cover and distance to urban edge), and species characteristics (body size) help determine patterns of occupancy and relative abundance of a suite of mammalian carnivores. Second, I exploit an ecological experiment—spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of the coyote among urban habitat fragments in San Diego—to assess the direct and indirect effects of this top predator on community structure. My results, providing support for the mesopredator release hypothesis, indicate that the disappearance of coyotes result in elevated numbers and activity of smaller carnivores that exert strong predation pressure on scrub-breeding birds and other native prey. Third, I calculate local extinction and recolonization rates of scrub-breeding bird species in the San Diego urban habitat fragments by comparing recent surveys with those conducted in this system a decade ago. The results suggest ongoing local extinction and recolonization of native birds, dynamics that are a function of both extrinsic forces (fragment area, age) and intrinsic factors (density, body size). Finally, in a general review of my research, I use differential fragmentation sensitivities of mammalian carnivores to evaluate their roles as targets for conservation and management plans in the region. I argue that the choice of target species depends on the scale or intensity of fragmentation in an area, and the corresponding responses of carnivore populations.

TI  - Mammalian habitat use along a residential development gradient in northern Colorado
AU  - Goad, Erica H.
AB  - "Exurban" development occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.

TI  - Demographic and genetic response of woodland amphibians to landscape change in southern Connecticut
AU  - Gibbs, James Peter
AB  - A critical question in conservation biology concerns how changes in land-use patterns affect the persistence of plant and animal populations and the distribution of genetic variation within them. This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.

TI  - Habitat, Connectivity, and Gene Flow of Mexican Spotted Owl in Southwestern Forests
AU  - Wan, Ho Yi
AB  - The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalix lucida ) has experienced population decline and has been listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1995. The cause of its decline has traditionally been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of human activities, including even-aged timber management and urban development. Over two decades have passed since the listing, with new information acquired and protection measures being in place to maximize the persistence potential of the species. Yet, the future of the species remains unclear as new threats emerge to negatively affect the species populations. In the southwestern United States, wildfires have increased in size and severity in many forests, and are expected to continue to increase with projected warmer and drier climate. The increased risk of large, high-severity wildfires has raised concern about its effects on the Mexican spotted owl, which typically nests in dense and old-growth forests that are prone fires. This dissertation contains 5 chapters that review current literature on threats to the spotted owl, evaluate habitat suitability, connectivity, and gene flow of the spotted owl under current landscape condition, and evaluate fire effects on the habitat of the spotted owl. Results from my dissertation provide much needed information for managing the Mexican spotted owl. The modeling and analytical approaches demonstrated herein lay the groundwork for quantitative assessments in improving the understanding of impacts of emerging threats on the threatened species.

TI  - Scenarios of future changes in land use, open space, and habitat connectivity around the National Wildlife Refuge System and other protected lands
AU  - Hamilton, Christopher M.
AB  - Conservation in the face of land use change, a primary threat to biodiversity, requires understanding both the threat changes pose to conservation efforts and the drivers of change.  Protected areas, our primary approach to conservation, are often surrounded by land being used for agriculture or houses, which affects their conservation value.  Considering current land use and identifying future threats is critical to effective conservation, both within protected areas and without.  My dissertation goal was to assess threats to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) from land use change.  To do this, I first quantified land use change around refuges under different economic policy scenarios.  Second, I quantified and projected housing growth effects on structural habitat connectivity.  Third, I projected changes in functional habitat connectivity under land use and climate change scenarios for Blanding's turtle, a species with limited dispersal ability. \My primary result was that there will likely be significant land use change regardless of economic policy scenario.  However, differences among scenarios were minor with the exception of restricting urban growth, which had stronger effects than other policies and preserved natural habitats as well as a policy specifically designed to preserve natural habitats.  In addition, relying on habitat connectivity to mitigate the effects of global change is unlikely to be broadly effective because urban use has already precluded restoring connectivity for many refuges.  In both of these cases, land use change patterns were strongly regional in nature.  Finally, climate change had a stronger influence on changes in habitat connectivity than land use change for the Blanding's turtle, which demonstrated a "trailing edge" effect wherein populations at the southern edge of the range lost habitat connectivity more quickly than in the northern part of its range.  My findings indicate that a single national policy is not workable without the flexibility to account for regional differences change, that conservation planning should occur at the ecoregional as well as the individual protected area level, and that protected areas managing for a single species should assess the effects of global change on their focal species and conservation goals.

TI  - The Relationship Between Species Diversity and Genetic Diversity in a Fragmented Forest System: A Case Study of Carex leptonervia in the Montérégie, Québec
AU  - Polcz, Catherine
AB  - The fragmentation of native temperate forests is a defining issue of rural and urban development in southern Québec. From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on pattern and typical function of regional wetlands
AU  - Zhao, Hui
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorGlobal urbanization has dramatically impacted various kinds of wetlands in the last decades. China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted "V" type to "# "type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones. The protection policies were formulated separately based on regional typical wetland

AB  - As ilhas oceânicas têm cativado o interesse de biólogos evolucionistas e ecólogos por serem entidades territoriais confinadas mas, em regra, com elevada biodiversidade, funcionando como modelos ideais para o estudo de processos evolutivos e de alteração ambiental. As ilhas são normalmente caracterizadas por um número significativo de espécies endémicas, que surgem por processos de especiação em contextos de isolamento (ecótipos ou neo-endemismos), bem como por habitats/ecossistemas únicos. Nesta perspectiva, a conservação e gestão destes valores ecológicos é crucial para garantir a sua viabilidade e sustentabilidade face às pressões antropogénicas a que estão sujeitos. Na Madeira, este desígnio conservacionista tem sido desenvolvido no seu Parque Natural. No presente trabalho pretende-se demonstrar a aplicabilidade de um protocolo de modelação dinâmico-espacial na previsão de tendências ecológicas relevantes para avaliar o estado de conservação de habitats nativos. A metodologia estocástico-dinâmica (StDM) foi a abordagem seleccionada em virtude de permitir estudar localmente o modo como indicadores ecológicos relevantes, expressos ao nível das comunidades, respondem às alterações do meio envolvente. O principal objetivo deste trabalho consistiu na selecção de indicadores que permitam avaliar qualidade ecológica dos habitats nativos em contraposição com os habitats moldados pela actividade humana, como as áreas periurbanas e agro-florestais. Para este efeito foram selecionados atributos das comunidades de passeriformes comuns (riqueza específica e abundância) como indicadores da presença de habitats humanizados, muito marcados pela presença de espécies exóticas, potenciais ameaças para a integridade dos habitats nativos. Em termos demonstrativos foram considerados dois cenários contrastantes: (1) o cenário de continuidade, tendo em conta o histórico das alterações em curso no território da Madeira, que têm gerado o aumento das espécies exóticas e da sua dispersão; (2) o cenário de gestão dos habitats nativos, com a implementação mais generalizada de medidas de conservação e de controlo de exóticas.Em termos comparativos, não obstante a degradação implícita no cenário de continuidade (especialmente induzida pela proliferação de espécies exóticas), os passeriformes revelaram-se bons indicadores da prevalência das características associadas a ecossistemas humanizados, com abundâncias relativas mais elevadas nesses contextos. Quando a gestão é simulada de forma a minimizar os efeitos associados às práticas humanas e/ou das suas consequências sobre os ecossistemas nativos (cenário de gestão), onde se privilegiou a manutenção dos habitats nativos e o controlo da expansão de espécies exóticas, as comunidades de passeriformes típicas dos sistemas humanizados reflectem essas tendências diminuindo a sua abundância relativa (embora sem reflexos na riqueza específica) nos ecossistemas/habitats alvo dessas medidas de conservação.

AB  - Landscape ecological research in the Netherlands has been fruitful because of the mutual exchange of ideas and results of fundamental and applied research. This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley. This can be of importance for research on the impact of climate change. However, it is not yet clear if other rivers have a comparable corridor.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes.

TI  - Pool -breeding amphibian habitat use and conservation in southern Maine's urbanizing landscapes
AU  - Baldwin, Robert Fritz
AB  - Pool-breeding amphibians utilize both wetland and terrestrial habitats, and thus are vulnerable to the combined threats of wetland and terrestrial habitat loss. Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat. A method to incorporate wetland habitat connectivity using a context-specific GIS is suggested.
