Both processes are mediated by interactions between organismal traits and environmental constraints. Colonization probability is predicted by a species’ ability to cross the intervening matrix between a population source and the island; population persistence (or extinction) is predicted by the minimum spatial requirements to sustain an isolated population. The non-random distributions of mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf and Great Basin “sky islands” provide example study systems for evaluating the C-DIB model.Main conclusions Because different suites of traits impose constraints on the processes of colonization and extinction, similar environmental conditions can host different candidate species despite the same predicted richness. Thus, the model exemplifies the specific yet underappreciated role of hysteresis –the dependency of outcomes not only on the current system state –but also the historical contingency of environmental change in affecting populations and communities in insular systems.",10.1101/251926,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/22/251926.abstract,NA,4,a constraint-based model reveals hysteresis in island biogeography,10.1101/251926,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/22/251926.abstract

The use of the matrix has been considered an important factor because it can change the relationship of a population with the configuration of the landscape. A systematic way to assess the effect of matrix quality in fragmented landscapes could lead to a better understanding of how matrices can be used to suppress the negative effect of fragmentation. We built a computational individual-based model capable of simulating bi-dimensional landscapes with three types of land cover (habitat, suitable matrix and hostile matrix) and individuals that inhabit those landscapes. We explored in which situations changes in the proportion of the suitable matrix in the landscape and the degree of usability of this suitable matrix can mitigate the negative effect of fragmentation per se. We observed that (i) an increase in the matrix quality (increases in the suitable matrix proportion and/or usability) can suppress the fragmentation effect in 47% of the simulated scenarios; (ii) the less usable the matrix is the more of it is needed to suppress the fragmentation effect; (iii) there is a level of usability below which increasing the suitable matrix proportion does cause the fragmentation effect to cease. These results point toward a landscape management that considers the similarity of the matrix to the native habitat under management. We suggest that an index to measure the usability of elements of the matrix could be an important tool to further the use of computational models in landscape management.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2020.08.10.244178,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/04/05/2020.08.10.244178.abstract,NA,4,quantity and quality of suitable matrices matter in reducing the negative effect of fragmentation on populations extinction risk,10.1101/2020.08.10.244178,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/04/05/2020.08.10.244178.abstract

We do so for the landscape as a whole as well as for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sparing-sharing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space.

This holds true for mangroves, although previous studies lack quantified representations of urbanness as well as any inclusion of hydrology or water chemistry, which are important influences on mangrove forest structure, composition, and function. This study uses LiDAR and ground-based measurements of mangroves within well quantified urban gradients in Puerto Rico to test for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed patterns of forest structure and composition. In simple regression, urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition but not structure. Results show higher tree diversity but lower mangrove diversity in the most urban forests. Structural measurements, however, were best explained by flooding, surface water chemistry, and non-urban land cover metrics. Nitrogen concentrations best explained stem density and tree size, while flooding metrics best explained stand biomass and basal area, and surrounding vegetation cover best explained canopy cover and height metrics. In multiple regression, land cover and surface water chemistry were more important than flooding, with population density again being the most important variable in explaining mangrove forest diversity. Results show that urbanization is an important influence on mangrove composition and basal area, leading to higher tree diversity and lower basal area, consistent with patterns in terrestrial forests. But urban mangrove forests are also lower in mangrove diversity and tend to have representation only by Laguncularia racemosa. Nitrogen concentrations and surrounding vegetation cover, both of which are indirectly influenced by urbanization, were positively related to tree size and canopy cover and height, respectively. These tests suggest urbanization is an important influence on mangrove forest structure and composition, but that flooding and water chemistry must also be considered when managing these forests.",10.1101/504928,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/21/504928.abstract,NA,2,mangrove forest structure and composition along urban gradients in puerto rico,10.1101/504928,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/21/504928.abstract

Whether and how much associations between species, i.e. the degree of correlation in their spatial co-occurrence, are also changing is much less documented and mostly limited to local studies of ecological networks. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition.Location France.Time period 2001-2017.Major taxa studied Common breeding birds.Methods We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1,969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of β-diversity and the proportion of habitat generalists. The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements.Results We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in β-diversity and in the proportion of generalists in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower β-diversity and a higher proportion of generalists, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes.Main Conclusions Although species association contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2020.11.13.380956,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/10/2020.11.13.380956.abstract,NA,8,biotic homogenisation in bird communities leads to large-scale changes in species associations,10.1101/2020.11.13.380956,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/10/2020.11.13.380956.abstract

For cities, the design of ‘green infrastructures’ or ‘nature-based solutions’ has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented, given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demands modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access for humans and no human design.We propose ‘Animal-Aided Design’ (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.",10.1101/150359,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/15/150359.abstract,NA,2,animal-aided design – using a species’ life-cycle to improve open space planning and conservation in cities and elsewhere,10.1101/150359,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/15/150359.abstract

Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments.Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess.We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the world’s fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (Chelodina longicollis) that people interact with regularly or have as pets. Chelodina longicollis utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation.Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss.Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that ∼40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation.Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes. Urban wetlands (natural and constructed) may provide “biodiversity arks” for endangered species and facilitate community led conservation programs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2020.06.22.127365,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/23/2020.06.22.127365.abstract,NA,2,quantifying costs of urbanisation: wetland loss and impacts in a rapidly developing global city,10.1101/2020.06.22.127365,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/23/2020.06.22.127365.abstract

Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have well-established mutual connections with the physiology of their hosts and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impacts of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on gut microbiota remain poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the gut microbiota in juvenile great tits (Parus major) in an urban mosaic. First, we compared the microbiota of nestlings reared in artificial nest boxes or natural cavities. Next, we analysed microbiota variations employing two distinct urbanisation frameworks, (i) the classical urban/rural dichotomy and (ii) gradual changes in the amount of impervious surface area (ISA) in the urban space and identified the environmental variables that predicted the changes in the microbial communities. Alpha diversity was influenced by cavity type and by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location. Alpha diversity was also positively correlated with the tree cover density. Beta diversity differed between urban and rural sites, and these alterations covaried with sound pollution, the distance to the city centre and the distance to the closest road. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework used to define the urban space can influence the outcomes of studies investigating animal-microbe symbiosis. Our results open new perspectives from which the potential function of microbial symbionts in the adaptation of their hosts to anthropogenic stress can be investigated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2021.04.15.439940,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/04/23/2021.04.15.439940.abstract,NA,8,alterations to the gut microbiota of a wild juvenile passerine in an urban mosaic,10.1101/2021.04.15.439940,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/04/23/2021.04.15.439940.abstract

We questioned whether an increase in road encroachment i.e., the advancement of roads into non-urban areas, leads to significant changes (positive and negative) in species occurrence, and if so, whether those changes are linked to specific traits related to perturbation sensitiveness, therefore acting as filters that increase the community compositional dissimilarity. Using a large citizen-science dataset of point-counts performed throughout Iberian Peninsula (4,459 unique survey sites), we modelled the effect of road density on the occurrence of common songbirds (n=58), while accounting for potential confounding effects of environment and survey effort. We then tested if species’ occurrence patterns would be linked to specific traits related to the ability to cope with human presence. Finally, we assessed how road density affect the community compositional dissimilarity. We estimated 24 (41%) and 12 (21%) species to be negatively and positively affected by roads, respectively. Increased road encroachment was positively related with a higher prevalence of urban dwellers and negatively related with the occurrence of species nesting and foraging on the ground. Furthermore, increasing road density translated into an increasing community compositional dissimilarity, mostly due to species turnover. Our study support previous research showing that roads have different effects on the occurrence of different species, but we revealed that at least three species' traits have a clear relation with such road responses. Such trait filtering is probably causing a high species turnover between songbird communities occurring in roaded and nearby roadless areas. Overall, we found that different species-specific responses to roads translates into changes at the community level. Landscape and road-network management should be conceived acknowledging that roads are contributing to biodiversity changes. As so, building upon the concepts of Land Sharing / Land Sparing, conservation actions should be tailored according to the different species responses e.g., road verge management targeting species having a positive relation with road density; and compensation actions targeting species showing a negative response toward roads.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2022.01.14.476305,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/01/17/2022.01.14.476305.abstract,NA,4,"road encroachment mediates species occupancy, trait filtering and dissimilarity of songbird communities",10.1101/2022.01.14.476305,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/01/17/2022.01.14.476305.abstract

Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar.

We used a functional response and effect trait approach to determine how bird species’ responses to local and landscape-scale habitat of urban green spaces affects the supply of cultural and regulating ecosystem services. We sampled bird communities and habitat variables in urban green spaces that varied in local and landscape-scale habitat composition and compiled a dataset of species’ response and effect traits related to nesting, foraging, diet, and visual and acoustic aesthetic appeal. Overall, the landscape-scale context of a green space had a stronger influence on species’ abundances than local-scale habitat. Landscape-scale impervious surface surrounding our study sites interacted with response traits related to nesting in human-built structures, clutch size, and consumption of invertebrates to drive bird species’ abundances. Because correlations between response and effect traits can influence the effect traits available to provide ecosystem services at a site, we explored the correlation of these three response traits to a suite of effect traits and found the response traits were correlated with several effect traits related to diet and regulating services but correlated with few of the plumage and acoustic traits that produce cultural services. Finally, we found that effect traits associated with cultural and regulating ecosystem services varied strongly along the landscape-scale gradient of urbanization. Sites with high impervious surface cover are expected to have low levels of invertebrate pest control and visual appeal but high levels of acoustic appeal, diet evenness (generalism), and granivory.

Here we present an inference tool that uses geographically-referenced genotype data in combination with a convolutional neural network to estimate a critical population parameter: the mean per-generation dispersal distance. Using extensive simulation, we show that our deep learning approach is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly at small sample sizes (e.g., n = 10). In addition, we evaluate varying nuisance parameters during training—including population density, population size changes, habitat size, and the size of the sampling window relative to the full habitat—and show that this strategy is effective for estimating dispersal distance when other model parameters are unknown. Whereas competing methods depend on information about local population density or accurate identification of identity-by-descent tracts as input, our method uses only single-nucleotide-polymorphism data and the spatial scale of sampling as input. These features make our method, which we call disperseNN, a potentially valuable new tool for estimating dispersal distance in non-model systems with whole genome data or reduced representation data. We apply disperseNN to 12 different species with publicly available data, yielding reasonable estimates for most species. Importantly, our method estimated consistently larger dispersal distances than mark-recapture calculations in the same species, which may be due to the limited geographic sampling area covered by some mark-recapture studies.

We quantified wild hoverfly and bee abundances with trapping, standing crop of nectar with spectrophotometer, and the pollen transported by flower-visitors with DNA-metabarcoding, in 40 independent sites from seminatural to built-up areas in Northern Italy.Linear and nonlinear relationships were detected along the urbanization gradient. Pollinator abundances increased until 22% of impervious surface, dropping by 34% after that, and it also decreased with green patch distance and urban park size. Thus, suburban landscapes host more pollinators than highly cemented or seminatural areas. Moreover, pollinators diminished by up to 45% in areas with low temperature seasonality: urbanized areas likely posing thermic stress. Furthermore, the sugar mass available in nectar increased by 91% with impervious cover, indicating that city nectars were less consumed or flowers more productive. Furthermore, the species richness of pollen decreased by 32% in highly urbanized areas, and with a high incidence of exotic plants, hinting for anthropized plant communities.Synthesis and applications. Urbanization influences pollinator abundances, nectar resources and transported pollen. Pollinators are negatively affected by a thermally harsh climate in highly urbanized areas with isolated green areas and large parks. Suburban landscapes demonstrated the highest pollinator presence.

We selected 20 ponds differing in size and surrounding levels of urbanization as well as natural forest cover. We then used a Poisson GLM and a distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA) to relate species richness and community composition, respectively, to environmental variables. Variation in species richness was best explained by pond size (positive effect) and amount of urbanization (negative effect) in the surrounding 500 m. Community composition was mainly driven by species turnover than by nestedness, with db-RDA showing that turnover was explained primarily by urban infrastructure and forest cover. Our results indicate that urbanization negatively influences species richness. Moreover, as the amount of urbanization increased, several species were replaced by others taxa that appear better adapted to urban environments.

This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 × 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = −8.4 to 0.1 °C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall – likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sørensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance - patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-decay pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.",10.1101/2020.06.04.133918,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/04/2020.06.04.133918.abstract,NA,2,"climate gradients, and patterns of biodiversity and biotic homogenization in urban residential yards",10.1101/2020.06.04.133918,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/04/2020.06.04.133918.abstract

We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct.

Cities often have elevated pollution levels that harm wildlife; however, the increased concentration of some pollutants can fertilize urban plants, leading to corresponding positive effects on herbivore populations. Increases in herbivory rates may lead to natural selection for greater defence phenotypes in plants. However, evidence supporting increased herbivory leading to the evolution of plant defence in urban environments is contradictory, and entirely absent from tropical regions of the world. To address these research gaps, we evaluated herbivory on Turnera subulata, a common urban wildflower, along an urbanization gradient in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We predicted that higher rates of herbivory in urban areas would lead these populations to evolve cyanogenesis, a chemical defence found in a closely related Turnera species. We assessed herbivory and screened for cyanogenesis in 32 populations along the urbanization gradient, quantified by the Human Footprint Index. Our results show that urbanization is significantly associated with increased herbivory rates in T. subulata populations. Despite elevated herbivory, we found no evidence for the evolution of cyanongenesis in any of the populations, suggesting that the fitness effects of leaf herbivory are not extreme enough to select for the evolution of plant defence in these populations.

In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and green corridors influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in corridors. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor.

Analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for strong isolation by distance, but did not support isolation by environment. Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity also suggested that C. linearis had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, consistent with previous findings in other southern Appalachian taxa.

This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without significantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would benefit a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species profiles defined by their affinity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species profiles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species profiles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types - either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species profiles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species profiles presenting different ecological requirements.

Due to the high percentage of forest cover and the favourable distribution of forest patches and cores around the city of Ljubljana, no connection is currently in danger; the weakest link is stretching from the centre of Ljubljana towards the southeast. In the process of evaluating the biodiversity of urban forests, it will be necessary to add connectivity among forest cores as an important index while evaluating the favourable conditions of different habitat types.

These closely related species diverged with gene flow and have strongly diverged songs and preference functions for the mate calling song rhythm. We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome. We suggest that the finely-tuned, highly divergent preference functions are likely an additional source of LD between male and female traits in this system.

For example, over the past three million years, the landscape of the Philippine Islands has repeatedly coalesced and fragmented due to sea-level changes associated with glacial cycles. This repeated climate-driven vicariance has been proposed as a model of speciation across evolutionary lineages codistributed throughout the islands. This model predicts speciation times that are temporally clustered around the times when interglacial rises in sea level fragmented the islands. To test this prediction, we collected comparative genomic data from 16 pairs of insular gecko populations. We analyze these data in a full-likelihood, Bayesian model-choice framework to test for shared divergence times among the pairs.

Sequences were employed to characterize population structure, infer phylogenetic relationships among populations and their divergence times, examine lineage accumulation through time, and identify presumptive species using coalescent methods. We also explored the origin of elevational and latitudinal replacements involved in spatial changes in species assemblages in the Andes.Results We found remarkable genetic structure within the complex, which consists of numerous lineages reaching &gt;12% sequence divergence; most divergent populations occur in areas separated by topographic barriers but several of them, typically not sister to each other, co-occur with elevational segregation on mountain slopes or replace each other with latitude along the Andes. Some close relatives occur in areas separated by thousands of kilometers, with more distant relatives occupying intervening areas. The complex likely originated in the Mexican highlands and expanded extensively in South America while diverging rapidly at a constant rate into many different lineages which have persisted for millions of years. Coalescent analyses consistently revealed that the complex may comprise more than 30 species; while we do not suggest these presumptive species should be recognized by taxonomists in the absence of additional data, H. leucophrys is a distant outlier among New World birds in terms of high lineage diversity within a single recognized species.Main Conclusions Our study captured wood-wren lineages in the act of building up diversity via divergence and persistence in allopatry, achievement of secondary sympatry, and coexistence at the landscape scale mediated by ecological and evolutionary divergence. Although dispersal by wood-wrens is restricted at present and this likely accounts for strong population structure across topographic barriers, their ranges have been dynamic, managing to disperse over much of the montane Neotropics. Phases of expansion and contraction of ranges and localized extinctions of populations likely account for phylogeographic patterns which are precursors to the origin of new species and the accumulation of diversity in tropical mountains.",10.1101/376681,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/376681.1.abstract,NA,6,extreme genetic structure and dynamic range evolution in a montane passerine bird: implications for tropical diversification,10.1101/376681,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/376681.1.abstract

A prominent framework is provided by ecological network studies, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas and patches (nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (edges). Ecological networks are key for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create and strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework based on network modelling for the study and modelling of ecological networks. We use network properties and centrality measures (degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality) and take into account the intensity of the dispersal capacity by introducing the corresponding weighted centrality measures. We simulate the dynamics of ecological networks by monitoring the residual dispersal capacity and the number of connected components from three perspectives: random attacks, deterministic attacks according to decreasing betweenness centrality and influence of master plans. We demonstrate that spatial network analysis is useful to monitor the performance of ecological networks and support decision-making, management, and planning. The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the pen-urban and urban areas of the town of Nuoro (Italy). Patches (nodes) have been selected among the ecosystems with target vegetal species Holm oak and cultivated and wild Olive while the connecting corridors (links) enable for seed dispersal.

In this context, subgenomic datasets offer novel opportunities to explore historical demography in detail, which is key to better understand the origins and maintenance of diversity in montane regions. Here we used a large ultraconserved elements dataset to get insights into the main biogeographic processes driving the evolution of the Montane Atlantic Forest biota. Specifically, we studied two species of warbling finches disjunctly distributed across a region of complex geological and environmental history. We found that a scenario of three genetically differentiated populations is best supported by genomic clustering methods. Also, demographic simulations support simultaneous isolation of these populations at ~10 kya, relatively stable population sizes over recent time, and recent gene flow. Our results suggest a dual role of climate: population divergence, mediated by isolation in mountain tops during warm periods, as well as population maintenance - allowing persistence mediated by shifts in elevation distribution during periods of climate change, with episodic bouts contact and gene flow. Additional support for the role of climate comes from evidence of their contact in a recent past. We propose that two major gaps, which we call São Paulo and Caparaó subtropical gaps, have been historically important in the divergence of cold adapted organisms in the Atlantic Forest, and could be associated to cryptic diversity.

We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050.

We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32k SNPs to reconstruct invasion routes from estimates of population divergence and admixture. Globally, we detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Rapid westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent colonization of Africa, the Americas, and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected.

However, no studies have investigated the role of urbanization in mangrove hurricane resistance and resilience, despite increasing urbanization of tropical shorelines. This study gauges the initial response and short-term recovery of Puerto Rico’s mangroves along well defined and quantified urban gradients following the 2017 hurricane season. Survival probability of tagged trees decreased with time, and the mean mortality across all sites was 22% after eleven months. Mean canopy closure loss was 51% one month after the hurricanes, and closure rates also decreased with time following the storms. Aboveground biomass accumulation decreased by 3.5 kg yr-1 per tree, corresponding to a reduction of 4.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 at the stand level. One year later, the mangroves have recovered to 72% canopy closure and to nearly 60% of their pre-storm growth rates. No connection to urbanization could be detected in the measured dynamics. Instead, species, size and geomorphology were found to play a role. Larger trees suffered 25% more mortality than smaller size classes, and Laguncularia racemosa suffered 11% less mortality than other species. Hydro-geomorphology was also found to play a role, with forests in tidally restricted canals experiencing more canopy loss but faster recovery than open embayment systems. These findings suggest size, species, and geomorphology are important in mangrove resistance and resilience to tropical storms, and that urbanization does not play a role.

The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to ""pristine"" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not. Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert. In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists. The case study reveals the need for collaboration throughout the stages of design, construction and maintenance in order to efficiently manage roadsides for multiple priorities.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/822478949?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=H73ej6Op2vAKsSzMi0ff%2BAwp7QU%3D,NA,1,"plant migration along freeways in and around an arid urban area: phoenix, arizona",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/822478949?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=H73ej6Op2vAKsSzMi0ff%2BAwp7QU%3D

To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use. My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat. Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1821391432?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Qs%2Fbgzwcb%2B%2FQM78HHeaLDYbtWjw%3D,NA,1,small mammal communities and functional connectivity in the lower rio grande valley: a landscape perspective,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1821391432?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Qs%2Fbgzwcb%2B%2FQM78HHeaLDYbtWjw%3D

We then examined the resistance effect of different land use types.ResultsWith the exception of mean elevation, we found that all parameters showed a significant relationship with genetic distance, indicating that unevenness in elevation provides functional resistance to gene flow. Although we found no evidence of landscape barriers (isolation‐by‐barrier), there was an indication of landscape resistance (isolation‐by‐resistance). Urban area and farmland are suggested to be the strong factors contributing to the resistance to gene flow, even though isolation‐by‐distance was also detected. When we examined gene flow for pairs of males and pairs of females, both isolation‐by‐distance and isolation‐by‐resistance were stronger in order of female pairs, male pairs, all individual pairs.ConclusionsWe conclude that landscape resistance was detectable with a high contrast in landscape heterogeneity and they are more influential on females than males.OPEN PRACTICESThis article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally‐shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700377060?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SNvnRXFa7RMX5V3lfgN8hBTwAKY%3D,NA,1,genetic and morphological variation of butterflies in relict habitats,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700377060?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SNvnRXFa7RMX5V3lfgN8hBTwAKY%3D

This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304251005?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=15Emb%2BMyiPOdVt%2BU%2BDJpCia1%2Fso%3D,NA,1,demographic and genetic response of woodland amphibians to landscape change in southern connecticut,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304251005?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=15Emb%2BMyiPOdVt%2BU%2BDJpCia1%2Fso%3D

I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations.

Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1548325831?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=3piS7a5w4rq87RxNffCNzpr7B2g%3D,NA,1,"critical effects of urbanization on a charismatic carnivore: genetic change, disease and toxicant exposure, and disease susceptibility in bobcat populations in an urban, fragmented landscape",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1548325831?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=3piS7a5w4rq87RxNffCNzpr7B2g%3D

From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2508515451?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SKYF5GXLVe3%2BOG7v1pqW%2FBXEhYg%3D,NA,1,"the relationship between species diversity and genetic diversity in a fragmented forest system: a case study of carex leptonervia in the montérégie, québec",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2508515451?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SKYF5GXLVe3%2BOG7v1pqW%2FBXEhYg%3D

We investigated the effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and gene flow for two sympatric amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), across a large (>35,000 km2) landscape in Maine, USA, containing numerous natural and anthropogenic gradients. Isolation‐by‐distance (IBD) patterns differed between the species. Spotted salamanders showed a linear and relatively high variance relationship between genetic and geographic distances (r = .057, p < .001), whereas wood frogs exhibited a strongly nonlinear and lower variance relationship (r = 0.429, p < .001). Scale dependence analysis of IBD found gene flow has its most predictable influence (strongest IBD correlations) at distances up to 9 km for spotted salamanders and up to 6 km for wood frogs. Estimated effective migration surfaces revealed contrasting patterns of high and low genetic diversity and gene flow between the two species. Population isolation, quantified as the mean IBD residuals for each population, was associated with local urbanization and less genetic diversity in both species. The influence of geographic proximity and urbanization on population connectivity was further supported by distance‐based redundancy analysis and multiple matrix regression with randomization. Resistance surface modeling found interpopulation connectivity to be influenced by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs. Our results highlight the influence of anthropogenic landscape features within the context of natural features and broad spatial genetic patterns, in turn supporting the premise that while urbanization significantly restricts interpopulation connectivity for wood frogs and spotted salamanders, specific landscape elements have unique effects on these two sympatric species.",10/grsk6p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2310559408?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gxPyrkG%2BuuedsOmuyTR57034jHk%3D,9,3,landscape genetics reveals unique and shared effects of urbanization for two sympatric pool‐breeding amphibians,10/grsk6p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2310559408?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gxPyrkG%2BuuedsOmuyTR57034jHk%3D

Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas.

Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building.

Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal. In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2695015697?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=i6Xwc6aJJn43GAdsVMrFzqYrppE%3D,NA,1,loggerhead shrike detectability and occurrence in coastal south carolina urban areas,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2695015697?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=i6Xwc6aJJn43GAdsVMrFzqYrppE%3D

The impact becomes even greater in the absence of ecological networks, which will provide greater return flow antigenic sites on time animal populations, thus significantly limiting their dynamics. The possibility of intra and inter-specific exchange between animal populations can be achieved through ecological corridors, which remain single strategy for solving animal populations in terms of environmental fragmentation in particular from road infrastructures. The impact becomes even bigger in animal populations in case of presence of leaks forest ecosystems near roads, in eco-tonal generations. Expansion and improvement of the road network in Albania has grown significantly in the extent of the impact on small vertebrate fauna as in urban and extraurban areas.

Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior. Mean occupancy was underestimated for most semi-arboreal species when only one method was used. Multi-method occupancy designs may thus improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use, which are important for guiding management and conservation decisions.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2562266960?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=HWLxBJj0fq53wbpCiJtisruoMus%3D,NA,1,forest structure shapes tropical terrestrial and arboreal mesomammal communities under moderate disturbance,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2562266960?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=HWLxBJj0fq53wbpCiJtisruoMus%3D

Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers. Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1925000206?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=UXzBWHm0jFbBfq1IcNbG6wdiNSk%3D,NA,1,the influence of land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1925000206?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=UXzBWHm0jFbBfq1IcNbG6wdiNSk%3D

In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes. First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors. In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304962999?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wXaz8ri0xk2zE9DDsdPps7y1u10%3D,NA,1,butterfly conservation in fragmented landscapes,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304962999?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wXaz8ri0xk2zE9DDsdPps7y1u10%3D

Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304984667?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=EMz9YS8d5mPbXZzFjBca%2Bg7Cx28%3D,NA,1,relationships between spatial configuration of tropical forest patches and diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in northeastern puerto rico,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304984667?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=EMz9YS8d5mPbXZzFjBca%2Bg7Cx28%3D

By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468723947?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=9uHBs6YOh69lwOyMSgmKiJQlJk8%3D,NA,1,multi-scalar drivers of native bee community composition and population genetic structure in human-altered landscapes,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468723947?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=9uHBs6YOh69lwOyMSgmKiJQlJk8%3D

Local habitat characteristics of a patch (lh), the cost of traversing the landscape matrix between patches (weighted connectivity [wc]), and the position of the patch in the habitat network topology (nt) all influence occurrence‐state. Existing models are data demanding or consider only local habitat characteristics. We address these shortcomings and present a network‐based modeling approach, which aims to predict species occurrence‐state in habitat patches using readily available presence‐only records.For the tree frog Hyla arborea in the Swiss Plateau, we delineated habitat network nodes from an ensemble habitat suitability model and used different cost surfaces to generate the edges of three networks: one limited only by dispersal distance (Uniform), another incorporating traffic, and a third based on inverse habitat suitability. For each network, we calculated explanatory variables representing the three categories (lh, wc, and nt). The response variable, occurrence‐state, was parametrized by a sampling intensity procedure assessing observations of comparable species over a threshold of patch visits. The explanatory variables from the three networks and an additional non‐topological model were related to the response variable with boosted regression trees.The habitat network models had a similar fit; they all outperformed the non‐topological model. Habitat suitability index (lh) was the most important predictor in all networks, followed by third‐order neighborhood (nt). Patch size (lh) was unimportant in all three networks.We found that topological variables of habitat networks are relevant for the prediction of species occurrence‐state, a step‐forward from models considering only local habitat characteristics. For any habitat patch, occurrence‐state is most prominently influenced by its habitat suitability and then by the number of patches in a wide neighborhood.

Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales.

Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440362827?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ZtUTWmkVzf2v3tzRgH9gm9j5%2BmM%3D,NA,1,process oriented infrastructure for climate-driven forest migration through cities,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440362827?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ZtUTWmkVzf2v3tzRgH9gm9j5%2BmM%3D

Conservation efforts based on natural reserves may not be able to maintain certain ecological processes that extend beyond the reserves. There is an urgent need to conserve or restore critical habitats outside of protected areas to maintain the functional connectivity of habitat networks. In this study, we developed a connectivity modelling approach associated with varying conservation scenarios to establish habitat conservation priorities in a rapidly urbanizing area of Shenzhen, China. We incorporated unprotected habitat patches into the reserve network via four scenarios and prioritized the contributions of these patches to habitat connectivity. We also investigated the responses of species with different dispersal abilities to habitat changes under each conservation scenario. The results showed that the spatial pattern of unprotected habitats played an important role in enhancing the connectivity of the entire network within the study area. The habitat patches around protected areas could create greater connectivity gains and should be prioritized for conservation. The key patches that substantially enhance connectivity were identified as special conservation concerns. The connectivity benefits from different scenarios were closely linked with species dispersal abilities.

A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists.

The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones. The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways.

Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities.Methods A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity.Results Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD).Discussion Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species α-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region.

The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440353937?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Pm6HbgWnT9KGzxAlj0tVhQhVBeM%3D,NA,1,avian communities and ecoacoustics in a tropical human-modified landscape,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440353937?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Pm6HbgWnT9KGzxAlj0tVhQhVBeM%3D

Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01; n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape.

To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls. Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis. Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY. These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks. I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates. I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events. Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15. Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2. In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT. Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009. Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point. These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists. Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural. The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC. I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate, and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC. In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas. I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park. Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%. I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration. It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles. In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes. However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/931548247?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Uzz0070WuTRdluYWVCsAjkLIMIY%3D,NA,1,population dynamics and occupancy patterns of eastern screech owls (megascops asio) in new york city parks and adjacent suburbs,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/931548247?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Uzz0070WuTRdluYWVCsAjkLIMIY%3D

The metropolitan area of Istanbul, with its rapid urbanization rate, has faced intense pressure regarding the sustainability of urban habitats. In this context, landscapes comprising patches affected by various disturbances and undergoing temporal changes must be analyzed, in order to assess city-related disturbances. In this study, the main objective was to understand how urbanization changed the function of the spatial distribution of the urban mosaic and, more specifically, its relationship with the size, shape, and connection among land-use classes. For this purpose, we took Besiktas, a district of Istanbul, as the study area. We evaluated the landscape pattern of the urban environment in two stages. First, we used medium-resolution satellite imagery to reveal the general interactions in the urbanization process. Landscape- and class-level landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape connectivity, and the distances between classes (green areas and artificial surfaces), patterns, and processes, using five satellite images representing a time span of 51 years (1963, 1984, 1997, 2005, and 2014). The general landscape structure was examined by looking at the temporal–spatial processes of artificial surface and green areas obtained from these medium-resolution satellite images. The trends in selected landscape-level metrics were specified and discussed through the use of a moving window analysis. We then used Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery (2015) to analyze the landscape structure in more detail. This high-resolution base image allows us to recognize the possibility of classifying basic cultural landscape classes. The findings regarding the spatial arrangement of each class in the areas allocated to 14 cultural landscape classes were interpreted by associating them with the landscape functions. Finally, particulate matter (PM10) concentration data were collected and evaluated as an ecological indicator, in order to reveal the relationships between landscape structure and landscape function. In short, we first evaluated the whole landscape structure using medium-resolution data, followed by the classification of cultural landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a time-effective—and, therefore, essential—auxiliary method for landscape evaluation.

We studied habitat selection, urban use by mountain lions, spatial movements and overlap, genetic relatedness, feline disease, and ectoparasites of mountain lions in southern Arizona.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304826958?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=UKbe3vdBWcdhytYa80ypqgdCFJM%3D,NA,1,spatial movements and ecology of mountain lions in southern arizona,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304826958?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=UKbe3vdBWcdhytYa80ypqgdCFJM%3D

Also, we identify this species' potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843-0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima.

These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2164566508?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=r5yuplT9gMgyygz6tqwOTuoYDt4%3D,NA,1,status and conservation of the grass snake in jersey,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2164566508?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=r5yuplT9gMgyygz6tqwOTuoYDt4%3D

Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2160960096?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VvOpZISPjvb22plG%2BU%2BVMO2UM8E%3D,NA,1,bee community response to local and landscape factors along an urban-rural gradient,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2160960096?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VvOpZISPjvb22plG%2BU%2BVMO2UM8E%3D

The US Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted an incentive-based conservation strategy known as the Safe Harbor Program (SHP) to reduce the vulnerability of federally protected species located on private properties. In addition to protecting populations, the SHP also strives to enhance species viability by devising strategies to (re)connect populations among habitat patches. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the initial Safe Harbor agreement, developed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis, hereafter RCW) in the North Carolina Sandhills, in enhancing connectivity for that species. According to our results, breeding territories located on private properties enrolled in the SHP promoted dispersal of RCWs and enhanced overall population connectivity relative to otherwise similar territories located on non-SHP properties. Moreover, the SHP created extensive stepping-stone corridors throughout the region. Our analysis also showed that RCW connectivity will be negatively impacted directly and indirectly by encroaching urban growth. By combining an urban growth model with estimated connectivity, managers and conservation planners can identify which properties critical for connectivity are most threatened by urban encroachment.

This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312380692?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=4lSlLS0IjAQkhp8wZDmekAZ9%2FfA%3D,NA,1,aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of lowland rural and urban ponds in leicestershire,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312380692?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=4lSlLS0IjAQkhp8wZDmekAZ9%2FfA%3D

Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2551569727?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=LjAvT6Yj1uKq6a8bBFZiPV1PNDo%3D,NA,1,nomadic animal movement and infectious disease in changing landscapes,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2551569727?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=LjAvT6Yj1uKq6a8bBFZiPV1PNDo%3D

A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels.

Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qSbDwCa4x79cWRIkSQZqmwYSkcg%3D,NA,1,study on the potential landscape safety pattern of urban air environment and ecological regulation of green spaces : case study of shanghai,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qSbDwCa4x79cWRIkSQZqmwYSkcg%3D

However, their narrowness cast doubts regarding their capacity to act as connectors for vertebrates with large home ranges, such as birds. Here we show that bird communities in drove roads crossing agrarian landscapes in the Madrid Region (Spain) are a predictable subset of species in comparison to those in wooded protected sites, and that species richness declines in them with the distance from Natura 2000 sites and with the reduction in forest cover of the area. Thus, drove roads sustain nesting bird communities that depend on the wider landscape rather than on their own characteristics, and can only play a secondary role as refuges, stepping stones or corridors funneling bird movements between protected sites.AbstractEcological connectivity among protected Natura 2000 sites is a priority for conservation in Europe due to the increasing pressure on biodiversity from human activities and climate change. Drove roads, the traditional paths used to move livestock through the territory, have been proposed as potential ecological corridors due to their large extent, continuous nature and centennial protection from ploughing and urbanization, which allows the persistence of some tree cover and natural habitats in them. Bird communities were sampled during the reproductive season along 19 drove road transects in agrarian landscapes between Natura 2000 sites, all of them around the conurbation of Madrid (Madrid Region, Spain). Bird community nestedness was assessed by NODF computation followed by significance estimation by aleatorization, and factors explaining species richness and bird abundance were analyzed through General Linear Models fitted with environmental variables measured on official vegetation maps and orthophotos. Bird communities in drove roads were significantly nested, showing high predictability in the order of species loss from better preserved sites to those under stronger environmental pressures. Accordingly, Poisson regression showed bird richness to decrease strongly with distance from the closest Natura 2000 site and to increase with forest cover at the landscape and at the drove road scales. Bird abundance increased strongly with distance from urban areas and motorways, and it was slightly higher in areas with more forest cover and in transects with less bare ground. These results, and the higher relevance detected for landscape scale variables (500 m around transects) than for those at the drove road (50 m) scale, show that (i) they can only play a secondary role as habitat for nesting birds but (ii) they may add to the Green Infrastructure strategy as facilitators or stepping stones for bird communities if the surrounding landscape is favorable for them.",10/grsk7w,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656368712?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qLIO3eaXq6bbUG4B0tqTHO4Y6Ys%3D,2,3,the potential role of drove roads as connecting corridors for birds between natura 2000 sites,10/grsk7w,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656368712?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qLIO3eaXq6bbUG4B0tqTHO4Y6Ys%3D

Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment. Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness. Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority. The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent. Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others. Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size. In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes.

Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses. Further research is needed to investigate other factors possibly affecting suitability of grasslands for meadow construction.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2685710200?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=xm%2BraVsFE%2Fr6aGJabm0FrkLQpls%3D,NA,1,what is the potential to increase local biodiversity in semi-urban amenity grasslands through meadow constructions?,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2685710200?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=xm%2BraVsFE%2Fr6aGJabm0FrkLQpls%3D

I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304900787?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=KP6j6WgMllPTHvdI90vRzQsnXhE%3D,NA,1,landbird demography and community structure along an urbanization gradient in the lake tahoe basin,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304900787?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=KP6j6WgMllPTHvdI90vRzQsnXhE%3D

I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species.

Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied. This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors.

The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1027911982?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Cii1P2m%2FqHJZhlOoLqWF2%2BKFFv8%3D,NA,1,"study on the frameworks, the functions and the landscape ecology planning methods of urban green corridors―a case study of wuhan",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1027911982?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Cii1P2m%2FqHJZhlOoLqWF2%2BKFFv8%3D

However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran’s I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI), Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran’s I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.",10/grsk9b,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756733126?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=2uOQI8RfRwEUodbcjPzgUKAfu%2B4%3D,11,5,"spatial pattern impact of impervious surface density on urban heat island effect: a case study in xuzhou, china",10/grsk9b,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756733126?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=2uOQI8RfRwEUodbcjPzgUKAfu%2B4%3D

Research on the adaptive planning policies for microthermal environments at the residential block level of cities is thus becoming of greater significance. Based on the cooling effect of planning control elements in residential block areas, the element effects characteristics of water bodies and vegetation distribution on the thermal environment of residential blocks were analyzed by using ENVI-met software. The simulation data analysis showed that the combination of water bodies and vegetation had a synergistic cooling effect. Based on these results, simulations of five effective adaptive measures were carried out step by step in planning scenarios, that is, improving the water bodies with vegetation corridors, the application of high-albedo material on streets, and increasing the number of green patches, east-west green corridors, and north-south green corridors. The results were as follows. First, although each of the five optimization strategies have a certain degree of cooling effect on the entire block, the superposition of each factor had a synergistic effect. Second, different spatial optimization strategies had different cooling ranges for each subzone. The optimization of the north-south green corridor, green patches, and water features corridors were particularly significant for microclimate cooling. The east-west green corridor has a certain influence on a certain range of downwind zones and had an auxiliary cooling effect. The high-albedo material also had a weak overall decrease function for the thermal environment. Finally, the downwind area of the urban creek network had a great impact on cooling intensity, with distance attenuation characteristics; it was also proposed that the comprehensive cooling effect of the green space network with optimized layout was greater than that of any single green space element.

It integrates issues of environmental concern, for example, biodiversity and ecological health, with the practices of a sample of urban dwellers. Private backgardens and public urban green spaces (parkettes) in the Greater Toronto Area were sampled and compared with respect to plant diversity and environmental heterogeneity. With a greater number of microhabitats and higher plant species richness than public parkettes, private backgardens were found to be remarkable hotspots of biodiversity and environmental heterogeneity. A backgarden microcosm experiment looked at the interaction of structural features of backgardens and the incidental recruitment of invertebrates, seeds, and plants. These small supplements of space served as habitats for recruitment of plants and seeds as it was determined that invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment and above-ground vegetation growth were enhanced regardless of soil or grass substrate treatment in microcosms. Backgarden characteristics, specifically the number of woody plants (trees and shrubs) and the number of plant species significantly predicted seed recruitment and winged invertebrate visitation, respectively, to microcosms. Lastly, a spatial analysis evaluated local and regional green space composition and heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Nearly 74% of the Greater Toronto Area is comprised of green space, however, more than 50% is made up of low vegetation (i.e., grass and herbaceous ground cover). Approximately 8% of the urban landscape was appraised as private backgardens; 6% of the urban landscape, conservatively, was estimated as backgarden green space. The percent green space composition of backgardens differed between neighbourhoods, and based on different human population densities, while neighbours were found to be statistically similar in their backgarden percent green space composition.

R.",2015,The distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,"pastsearch, proquest",NA,"Urbanisation is a key driver in the loss, fragmentation and modification of natural habitats resulting in the global loss of biodiversity. As the human population, and consequently the rate of urbanisation, continues to increase exponentially it is important to understand how to sustain and enhance biodiversity within the built environment. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet relatively little is known of how its composition and spatial configuration can influence species presence or foraging activities. It is therefore necessary to examine habitat use and biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales to fully understand how species are responding to the urban matrix. There are few other orders of animals that are as strongly associated with people as bats (Chiroptera); for some bat species human habitations provide roosts and adaptations of the environment provide food sources. However bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation indicating that many species are not able to persist in highly urbanised areas. In this thesis, I show that the behaviour, habitat preferences, and distribution of bats are strongly influenced by the built environment at both a local and landscape scale. Although many animal species are known to exhibit sex differences in habitat use, adaptability to the urban landscape is commonly examined at the species level without consideration of potential intraspecific differences. I found that female Pipistrellus pygmaeus show greater selectivity in foraging locations within urban woodland in comparison to males at both a local and landscape scale. There was a lower probability of finding females within woodlands which were poorly connected, highly cluttered, with a high edge: interior ratio and fewer mature trees. The results have important implications for our understanding of how to manage areas for breeding females and highlight the need to supplement acoustic monitoring with trapping data to assess sex differences in habitat use. Determining how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The morphological similarities between P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus suggest that both species should respond similarly to the urban matrix, however I found differential habitat use occurring within a variety of urban habitats (e.g. woodland and waterways) and at a landscape scale. In urban woodland there was a higher probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats yet we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. After surveying urban waterways throughout the UK, I was able to show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of bat species from the riparian zone up to 3km from a waterway. This indicates that beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales, from retaining a vegetated riparian zone at the local scale to highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes that encompass the entire urban matrix. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species such as bats. I was able to demonstrate a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency (e.g. the use of an acoustic lure to increase bat-capture rate) and a significant relationship between bat activity and the relative abundance of certain species of bat which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area whilst minimising wildlife disturbances. Urbanisation has also had strong negative effects on many insect groups, such as moths, which are important components of the diets of many bat species. I found that woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscapes in determining the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages within urban woodland. This indicates that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be more beneficial for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. The findings presented in this thesis have important implications for our understanding of the adaptability of species to the built environment and for the management and monitoring of bat populations. It also highlights that even common bat species are negatively affected by urbanisation and much greater attention should be paid to securing their future within the urban landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827522179?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=CdQXNWtlJhpg%2B4yHfXeyEkZUw7g%3D,NA,1,the distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827522179?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=CdQXNWtlJhpg%2B4yHfXeyEkZUw7g%3D

The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species.

Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values.

Wildlife species can exhibit different responses to urbanization, with some species being more sensitive than others. Further, wildlife communities can exhibit varying patterns of species richness across the gradient of urbanization, where species richness can either decrease linearly or peak at intermediate levels of urbanization, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). For chapter one, the objective was to evaluate the response of bats to urbanization across seasons. It was predicted that bat species would exhibit different responses to urbanization and that bats would increase use of urbanized areas in the summer season, where food and water resources were assumed to be greater. For chapter two, the objective was to evaluate species richness of bats across the gradient of urbanization in the summer season. Species richness of bats was predicted to either decrease linearly or peak at moderate levels of urban intensity. To test these hypotheses, 50 sites across the gradient of urbanization were sampled during four seasons using stationary acoustic bat monitors. Fourteen bat species were identified during 1000 nightly occasions. Consistent with chapter one predictions, bat species exhibited different responses to urbanization, with most bats being sensitive to urbanization. Counter to predictions, most bats did not appear to shift their response to urbanization across seasons. However, two bats (i.e., big brown bat and Yuma myotis) exhibited higher use of urbanized areas in the summer compared to other seasons. Consistent with chapter two predictions, species richness of bats decreased with increasing urban intensity. Results from this study demonstrate that most bats in the community were sensitive to urbanization, which is potentially related to species traits and has important conservation implications. First, it is likely important to maintain high-quality undeveloped habitat with low anthropogenic disturbance in wildland areas for species that are sensitive to urbanization and to maximize species richness.

There is rising concern over human wildlife conflict and its effects on human and animal wellbeing. Investigation into the biophysical and social landscape features that shape conflict or how spatial patterns in conflict ultimately affect species’ movement or survival is limited. Characterizing landscape connectivity and identifying potential movement corridors is a key conservation strategy, but is challenged by the fact that many wildlife species navigate a mosaic of infrastructure, available habitat, land uses, and political boundaries. In this thesis, I investigated the social and biophysical factors that contribute to conflict with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and how this conflict may impact connectivity for bears across southern British Columbia and northern Washington. I selected this system due to its rich cultural history with grizzly bear biological and social complexity. The region has current grizzly bear populations, extirpated areas, state/provincial and international boundaries, diverse land uses, and a variety of social values towards wildlife. I used two resource selection approaches to first determine the probability of conflict reporting across all wildlife species, and then to determine the probability of bear conflict specifically. First, I used presence and background sampling in combination with Bayesian logistic regression to identify important predictors of conflict across species using 5,606 reported instances of conflict and 8,703 background points. Then, I fit a second regression treating 2,062 bear conflict occurrences as presence points and 3,544 instances of other conflict as absences to characterize how bear conflict might differ from wildlife conflict in general.I found that predictors of conflict differed between species and that the probability of general wildlife conflict was substantially different than the probability of bear conflict across the study system. The strongest predictors of conflict for all species were human population density and both livestock and row-crop operation density. The strongest predictors of bear conflict were public opinion of bears, proximity to existing grizzly bear populations, and suitable bear habitat. Generating spatial predictions on these models indicates that the urban centers of the Okanagan (e.g., Kelowna, Vernon) are hotspots for general wildlife conflict while the semi-urban and rural agriculture landscapes (e.g., outside Penticton and along the US and Canada border) are hotspots for bear conflict (Chapter 1). I then incorporated spatial predictions of the probability of bear conflict into the resistance surface for a connectivity model across the traditional territory of the Sylix people to investigate how spatial patterns of conflict may impact bear movement and the ability to recolonize the traditional Sylix territory. I used Omniscape to model connectivity as a function of biophysical variables to identify the most likely available movement pathways and compared this to model outputs that incorporated the probability of conflict into the resistance surface to determine the effects of conflict on grizzly bear connectivity. My research highlights the role that social and institutional variables play in conflict and how these effects may differ between species. Further, my results illustrate the potential for conflict to constrain wildlife movement and highlight the need to treat connectivity conservation as a socio-ecological issue rather than just an ecological one.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2728995676?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=n3ejMpU%2FTgp%2FBTP1crIyr3%2BPBsk%3D,NA,1,"integrating social, political, and economic factors into spatial models of grizzly bear conflict and connectivity",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2728995676?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=n3ejMpU%2FTgp%2FBTP1crIyr3%2BPBsk%3D

Movement of host species plays a key role in maintaining transmission of direct-contact disease. Understanding how wildlife hosts move in fragmented urban landscapes is therefore imperative for disease control efforts. In cities, disease spread can be affected by the ability of a host to move through urban features, or by behavioural changes that are pathogen induced. Using the urban-adapted red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its associated disease sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in the city of Toronto, I ask: How does movement of foxes according to landcover type affect the spread of mange? And how does variable movement of susceptible and infected foxes influence mange transmission? These questions are addressed using an individual-based modeling approach, where two movement behaviours of foxes in a city are compared: random and least-cost path. To assess the effects of movement ability according to disease status (here, susceptible-biased, and infected-biased movement), I compare a range of movement probabilities. For each scenario, the number of effective contacts and the effective reproduction number (Re) are estimated. Findings suggest that mange spread may be accelerated when movement is based on landcover types and when there is equal movement ability of susceptible and infected foxes.

Over two decades have passed since the listing, with new information acquired and protection measures being in place to maximize the persistence potential of the species.

Protected areas, our primary approach to conservation, are often surrounded by land being used for agriculture or houses, which affects their conservation value. Considering current land use and identifying future threats is critical to effective conservation, both within protected areas and without. My dissertation goal was to assess threats to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) from land use change. To do this, I first quantified land use change around refuges under different economic policy scenarios. Second, I quantified and projected housing growth effects on structural habitat connectivity. Third, I projected changes in functional habitat connectivity under land use and climate change scenarios for Blanding's turtle, a species with limited dispersal ability. \\\\My primary result was that there will likely be significant land use change regardless of economic policy scenario. However, differences among scenarios were minor with the exception of restricting urban growth, which had stronger effects than other policies and preserved natural habitats as well as a policy specifically designed to preserve natural habitats. In addition, relying on habitat connectivity to mitigate the effects of global change is unlikely to be broadly effective because urban use has already precluded restoring connectivity for many refuges. In both of these cases, land use change patterns were strongly regional in nature. Finally, climate change had a stronger influence on changes in habitat connectivity than land use change for the Blanding's turtle, which demonstrated a ""trailing edge"" effect wherein populations at the southern edge of the range lost habitat connectivity more quickly than in the northern part of its range. My findings indicate that a single national policy is not workable without the flexibility to account for regional differences change, that conservation planning should occur at the ecoregional as well as the individual protected area level, and that protected areas managing for a single species should assess the effects of global change on their focal species and conservation goals.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1554684557?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=AufbrWfAK2LSSQ750K%2Bdp6jdYY8%3D,NA,1,"scenarios of future changes in land use, open space, and habitat connectivity around the national wildlife refuge system and other protected lands",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1554684557?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=AufbrWfAK2LSSQ750K%2Bdp6jdYY8%3D

Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region.Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable.Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species. I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles. Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions.

However, the underlying mechanisms that influence headwater wetlands in urban landscapes are poorly understood. Further, biodiversity loss may reduce ecosystem function and increase the transmission risk for some enzootic diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). My research aimed to: 1) assess wetland vegetation structure and the importance of fragment size and landscape position on biodiversity; 2) test the importance of flooding conditions for mitigating invasive plant dominance in forested wetlands using Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) as my study system; and 3) identify relationships between vegetation structure, fragment size, and the relative abundance of competent avian WNV hosts and mosquito vectors. I used a combination of measurative and experimental research methods to address these objectives, the third of which was part of a collaborative interdisciplinary research grant. Vegetation structure was measured in 36 plots located in six forested wetlands and data loggers were used to monitor aboveground flooding. Avian and mosquito research teams coordinated iii with my sampling points. My results illustrate the capacity for urban headwater wetlands to support a diverse flora, as well as the complex interactions between human activities and wetland structure and function. Red maple, oak, sweetgum, and green ash were the dominant tree species. Half of the 287 plant species identified only occurred at 1-2 sample points. Groundcover composition reflected the confluence of hydrogeomorphology, and past and present human actions. Connectivity via nearby streams or ditches had a greater impact on exotic plant richness than did wetland patch size. Aboveground flooding prior to seedling emergence significantly reduced the distribution of Japanese stiltgrass. Avian species richness was positively correlated with plant richness. In contrast, mosquito richness was negatively correlated to plant richness. WNV hosts and vector abundance both increased with maple (Acer spp.) tree canopy dominance. Cumulative host abundance averaged 24% and was composed primarily of American Robin, which showed large interannual shifts in fragments <15 ha.

These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores. In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes. In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1288376606?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ik0Vh3y5oOvyOtFYmjcDysupqog%3D,NA,1,the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern california,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1288376606?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ik0Vh3y5oOvyOtFYmjcDysupqog%3D

Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors.

We examined the effect of greenway forested corridor width, vegetation composition and structure, and adjacent land cover on the species richness and abundance of migrating songbirds during spring and fall migration in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Generally, migrating birds were more abundant in wider forest corridors during spring and fall migration. During the spring, migrants were detected more commonly in greenways with taller trees and a higher percentage of hardwood trees. In the fall, migrant richness and abundance was highest in greenways with lower canopy cover, possibly because of the increased vertical complexity of the vegetation at these sites. Forest-interior migrant richness was not correlated with corridor width in either season, but these species were more abundant in greenways bordered by less bare earth and pavement cover in the spring. No other bird groupings were correlated with adjacent land cover measures. Although migrants used greenways of all widths, forested corridors wider than 150 m should be conserved whenever possible to provide stopover habitat for forest-interior migrants. Shrub cover should be retained to maintain vegetative complexity. Habitat for the greatest diversity of migrants can be provided by constructing greenways in areas of lower development intensity and encouraging residents to retain shrubs and trees on properties bordering greenways.

Commonly-used species-specific connectivity models are difficult to generalize for a wide range of taxa. In the context of multi-functional land-use planning, there is growing interest in species-agnostic approaches, modelling connectivity as a function of human landscape modification. We propose a conceptual framework, apply it to model connectivity as current density across Alberta, Canada, and assess map sensitivity to modelling decisions. We directly compared the uncertainty related to (1) the definition of the degree of human modification, (2) the decision whether water bodies are considered barriers to movement, and (3) the scaling function used to translate degree of human modification into resistance values. Connectivity maps were most sensitive to the consideration of water as barrier to movement, followed by the choice of scaling function, whereas maps were more robust to different conceptualizations of the degree of human modification. We observed higher concordance among cells with high (standardized) current density values than among cells with low values, which supports the identification of cells contributing to larger-scale connectivity based on a cut-off value. We conclude that every parameter in species-agnostic connectivity modelling requires attention, not only the definition of often-criticized expert-based degrees of human modification.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2393641802?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=7pLustSuKIqDz6sToU0VIMA6wYE%3D,10,6,"conceptual framework and uncertainty analysis for large-scale, species-agnostic modelling of landscape connectivity across alberta, canada",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2393641802?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=7pLustSuKIqDz6sToU0VIMA6wYE%3D

In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments.

Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1439927159?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wjS4I6bb8NYuXE7lmn%2FWztaFtkQ%3D,NA,1,mammalian habitat use along a residential development gradient in northern colorado,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1439927159?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wjS4I6bb8NYuXE7lmn%2FWztaFtkQ%3D

We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario’s eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN), Chelydra serpentina, and Midland Painted (MP) turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding’s turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding’s turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding’s turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations.

China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted ""V"" type to ""# ""type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones.

Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis.

We identified the key vegetation attributes that predicted mammal species richness and occurrence of herbivores and omnivores in urban forest patches. A total number of 19 mammal species from 120 sampling points were recorded. Contiguous forest had the highest number of species compared to the urban forest patches. Sunda Pangolin and Asian Tapir were the only conservation priority species recorded in the urban forest patches and contiguous forest, respectively. Top predators such as Malayan Tiger and Melanistic Leopard were completely absent from the forest patches as well as the contiguous forest. This was reflected by the abundance of wild boars. We found that mammal species richness increased with the number of trees with DBH less than 5 cm, trees with DBH more than 50 cm, and dead standing trees. In the future, the remaining mammal species in the urban forest patches are expected to be locally extinct as connecting the urban forest patches may be infeasible due to land scarcity.

Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305049306?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=mvxzJ8pn9l5i9P%2FePfofXnqPwgs%3D,NA,1,the effect of urbanization on butterfly species diversity,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305049306?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=mvxzJ8pn9l5i9P%2FePfofXnqPwgs%3D

Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat.

Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions.

This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley.

Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions.

Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor.

Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable.

River ecological corridor plays an important role in the protection of urban bird habitats. However, the diversity of different ecological community of birds is influenced by environmental factors at multiple scales. The habitat pattern optimization and habitat construction of birds in urban ecological corridors for specific ecological community need the support of theoretical research urgently. Based on the analysis of bird species composition in Beijing Wenyu River ecological corridor in spring, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of environmental factors on bird species composition of different ecological communities at three scales of landscape pattern, habitat patch and micro-habitat, in order to understand the impact of environmental factors on bird habitat selection, and provide reference for bird diversity protection and habitat construction of urban river ecological corridors. [Method] In the spring of 2019, we conducted a field survey of bird species composition and plant community structure in the Wenyu River ecological corridor. Landscape pattern analysis was conducted after visual interpretation of the habitats in the corridor. Redundant analysis (RDA) was used to analyze the correlation between bird species composition and multi-scale environmental factors. [Result] The pattern characteristics within 50−200 m had the highest interpretation for the overall composition of birds. The composition of songbirds was mainly related to the Pielou index of trees in the community, the area of water and wetland within a small range, and some indexes of grassland and deciduous forest within a large range. The composition of terrestrial bird was mainly related to cropland and shrub. The composition of swimming birds and wading birds had a strong correlation with water body area and wetland area within a small range. The composition of raptorial birds was associated with wetland waters. In same ecological community, the composition of different reside pattern birds had different correlations with environmental factors. Most bird abundance was positively correlated with wetland area, wetland largest patch index and wetland cohesion index within 100 m, and waterbody splitting index within 2 000 m. [Conclusion] The relationship between birds of different ecological communities and various environmental factors is diverse, but the indices of water body and wetland have influence on birds of all ecological communities in the river ecological corridor. In the future construction of urban ecological corridors, we suggest to consider the habitat preferences of different bird communities, pay attention to the optimization of the habitat pattern of wetland water in corridors, and carry out the construction and protection of bird habitats for targeted species. © 2022 Beijing Forestry University.

In this context, building ecological networks to increase habitat connectivity in urban scale is vitally important for effective conservation. Because the data of other species is inaccessible, taking the observed bird population as focal species and to build ecological networks provides us a novel idea for protecting local biodiversity. This paper takes Beijing plain as study area to build a systematic ecological network. Based on the data of spatial distribution of typical 86 kinds of bird that are in the list of threatened species, we explore the potential habitats as source patches under the support of Maxent model. Then we utilize the land use data to create resistance surface which symbolizes the degree of difficulty of species′ passing through among habitats, by means of that we integrate the spatial data with the minimum cumulative resistance model, and a classified ecological network is constructed. The result shows that wetlands and public gardens are the dominant habitats, which represent 81% natural areas in Beijing plain. The identified habitat sources are classified two types according to the linear relation of species richness and the extent of habitats, and the number of primary and the secondary habitats are 58 and 146, respectively. Similarly, the modelled ecological corridors are also classified into the primary and secondary types. The former represents the corridors among primary habitats, and the latter are corridors that connects the primary habitats with the secondary habitats. Totally, the number of corridors is 948 and the length is 3760 kilometers. Moreover, 12 essentially ecological nodes are selected by kernel density analysis, and 6 key corridors are confirmed according to their ecological attributes. These nodes and corridors are important ecological infrastructures in biodiversity conservation on Beijing plain. In conclusion, building up 948 corridors are believed to be beneficial for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, the ecological network is also an optional solution and reference for local decision makers to draw up scientifically and rationally a spatial optimized planning for human-nature harmonious Beijing. © 2022 Science Press.

The construction and simulation of the existing urban ecological network are mostly based on two-dimensional data information, and the impact of the multi-ecological niche represented by the three-dimensional structure information of vegetation on the habitat quality is not well considered, so the function effectiveness of the ecological network remains to be verified. This paper quantified the three-dimensional green space vegetation structure based on the airborne LiDAR and high-resolution remote sensing image data in the main urban area of Nanjing city. We extracted the ecological source area and built the landscape resistance surface in two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and identified the ecological corridor under the two scenarios based on least-cost path method. Meanwhile we identified the ecological key nodes in the corridors that need to be protected according to the circuit theory, then analyzed the impact of using two-dimensional and three-dimensional ecological spatial information on the results of ecological network construction. The results show that: 1) there are 11 different ecological sources extracted under different scenarios within the study area. Compared with the traditional two-dimensional scenario, using three-dimensional vegetation parameters can more accurately identify ecological sources with rich vegetation structures. 2) There are 137 and 129 ecological corridors constructed in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and the average unit resistance of each corridor is 18.2 and 24.0, respectively. The traditional two-dimensional information simulation overestimated the landscape connectivity of the study area. 3) The spatial distribution of key ecological nodes in different scenarios is similar, mainly concentrated in the northwest, middle and southeast of the study area, and more often appear in the source patches with close distance.

In such models, the occurrences of focal species are related to habitat and landscape variables, which in urbanising areas should also include effects of urban disturbances. Moreover, the accuracy of the spatial predictive models may be affected by spatial autocorrelation, which means that a part of the variance is explained by neighbouring values. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat and disturbance patterns on the distribution of two forest grouse species, Tetrao urogallus and Bonasa bonasia, and to detect and model the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The distribution of the two species could be explained in terms of reduction of a main predator, habitat quality, quantity and connectivity, including urban disturbances. The residuals of the initial regressions showed positive spatial autocorrelation that could be quantified by using a spatial probit model. The application of the spatial probit model revealed strongly significant spatial dependencies for both species. Furthermore, the model fit could be increased for T. urogallus by applying this model. The results implied that both species distributions might be affected by both reactions to the underlying land-use pattern, but also by interaction with neighbours. The use of the spatial probit model is a way to incorporate spatial interactions that otherwise cannot be captured by the independent variables. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

To protect an ecosystem more effectively, it is necessary to identify ecological corridors and ecological networks. Therefore, based on the Minimal Cumulative Resistance model and taking Chongqing in China as an example, the identification of potential ecological corridors and the construction of an ecological network in Chongqing were realized using the Linkage Mapper software. The results were as follows: (1) From 2005 to 2015, the patch area of cultivated land and grassland in Chongqing decreased by 0.08% and 1.46%, respectively, while that of built-up areas increased by 1.5%. The fragmentation degree of cultivated land was higher, and the internal connectivity of forestry areas was worse.

The results indicated that the spatial distribution of patches in current park green space was uneven and area discrepancy was large, which is especially true in densely populated areas with less patch number of park green space and obviously low available area for disaster shelter. By substantially increasing the quantity and area of patches, improving the inter-patch connectivity, and increasing landscape fragmentation index appropriately, the \\\\""point-line-plane\\\\"" pattern of park green space system in Nanchang would be optimized and the spatial distribution would be more rational, which could effectively enhance its role in biodiversity conservation, disaster prevention, and risk avoidance.

Habitat fragmentation and the resultant decrease in habitat connectivity has become a serious challenge for biodiversity conservation. Green spaces are important habitat resources in the city. The development of green space ecological networks can be used to increase the connectivity between fragmented habitat patches, which promotes urban biological diversity conservation. Taking Bazhong western new district, a rapidly urbanizing area in Sichuan, China, as a case study, a novel method is proposed using Guidos, GIS and the gravity model to develop green space ecological networks. First, the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) model in the software Guidos was used to identify the main types and structure of green spaces in the landscape. The “cores”and “bridges”were extracted, which will make the foundation of the green space network. Second, using the software Conefor, the integral index of connectivity (IIC), probability of connectivity (PC) and the percentage of importance (dI) of each individual element were used to evaluate the relative importance of these cores and bridges to landscape connectivity. Accordingly, the top ten core patches acting as ecological sources were identified. The remaining cores and bridges were ranked based on their importance in maintaining ecological network connectivity. Finally, using GIS, potential ecological networks were developed using the least-cost path method, and the important corridors were identified using the Gravity model. A plan to optimize the ecological network in the study area was put forward. This research shows that the structural elements, the cores and bridges of ecological networks can be identified via the MSPA method and that landscape connectivity measurements (IIC, PC and dI) provide good quantitative measures of the relative importance of landscape patches, especially when considering landscape patch spatial distributions. The evaluation of landscape patches can help to identify and extract important protected landscape elements. Least-cost path analysis also provides important reference information for evaluating landscape patch habitat quality, which most previous researches have evaluated by subjective assessments. The research results show that the combination of MSPA with measures of landscape connectivity and least-cost path analysis are a novel and useful method for developing green space ecological networks in urban and other fragmented areas. The results will help to guide the development and management of green spaces for biodiversity conservation. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

As the connected green space in the city, the ecological corridor plays an important role in the biodiversity conservation in the process of urbanization. As an important part of urban plant diversity, spontaneous plants provide resources for the survival of native animals and play a key role in the construction of low-maintenance plant landscape. In this study, we determined the overall composition of spontaneous species in the Wenyu River-North canal ecological corridor in Beijing, explored the changes of species composition and diversity characteristics of spontaneous plants with urbanization gradients, and analyzed the adaptability of different spontaneous species to urbanization. A total of 195 plant species were recorded which belonged to 156 genera and 73 families, and most of them were herbaceous plants. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity of spontaneous woody plants at different urbanization levels. However, the alpha-diversity of spontaneous herbaceous plants at medium urbanization level was significantly higher than that at other levels (P < 0.05). With the increase of urbanization index, the beta-diversity of woody plants, annual herbs and biennial herbs increased, and the beta-diversity of perennial herbs, invasive plants and exotic plants decreased. The mean niche width with urbanization gradient was ranked as invasive plants > native plants > domestic exotic plants > foreign exotic plants. According to the niche width, the ecological corridor autophytes were divided into high adaptability type, moderate adaptable type and low adaptable type. We screened some native plant species with similar adaptability to the 15 invasive plants according to niche overlap. The results can provide references for constructing stable low-maintenance spontaneous plant communities, that can resist the spread of invasive plants, so as to bring the function of biodiversity conservation of urban river ecological corridors into full play. © 2022 Science Press.

Consequently, we used GPS/UHF transmitters to study their home range size, movement and habitat use in an urban-forest mosaic in Eshowe, South Africa from March to October 2014. We estimated the home range size using three methods: minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density estimation (KDE) and local convex hull (LoCoH).

In this study, 39 species of key protected plants in Xiamen were selected as the objects. MaxENT, a species distribution model is used to predicate the potential distribution of species. Zonation, a quantitative tool for Spatial Conservation Priority, is used to identify the areas that are suitable for the survival of key protected plants and can ensure the landscape connectivity, so as to obtain the multi species landscape protection level of local key protected plants. According to the 2020 global biodiversity target, 17% of the areas with the highest level of landscape protection will be regarded as the spatial conservation prioritization areas of multi species. Combined with the weighted extinction risk curve with landscape loss generated by zonation model, 8% of the areas with the highest level of protection are classified as primary conservation areas, and the areas with the protection level ranging from 8% to 17% are classified as secondary conservation areas. By using jackknife method in MaxENT, it is found that altitude is the most important environmental factor affecting the distribution of local key protected plants, and spatial conservation prioritization areas are concentrated in the coastal zone with lower altitude. The spatial conservation prioritization areas in this study were compared with nature reserve, the planning of ecological function zones, land use planning and urban master planning of Xiamen, it is found that the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the West and north of Xiamen are well protected; the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone of southwest and southeast of the island and the eastern and southern of outside the Xiamen island have been occupied by construction land on a large scale. there are few areas included in the scope of nature reserves, and a large number of coastal conservation prioritization areas are vacant; although the part of the conservation prioritization areas in the southeast of outside the Xiamen island are not occupied, they are planned as reserve land for development and lack of ecological protection. In order to avoid the further reduction of conservation prioritization areas, we should focus on the ecological protection of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone. The conservation prioritization areas that belong to development reserve will be converted into ecological space. We should strictly control the further development and utilization of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone so as to protect biodiversity.

And the minimum cumulative resistance model is used to construct resistance surface. At the same time, in order to intuitively reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, this paper uses 9 natural protected areas as ecological sources, and selects six resistance factors including landscape ecological index, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from roads, and distance from waters calculate the resistance value. Combining the ecological source area and the minimum cumulative resistance value, Then we identified ecological corridors and ecological nodes, and finally built an ecological security pattern and proposed ecological security protection strategies.

Consequently, it is necessary to find out the impacts of land use change on habitat network as well as the dispersal and migration of species, especially in current rapid urbanizing condition. The research results will be a great contribution to rebuilding and optimizing regional ecological network from the perspective of species conservation and ecological process, but not only the landscape structure as most previous research did. The aim of the paper is to find out: (1) how to map out the habitat network of a certain species from TM images in a grid pattern? (2) How land use change affected the habitat network of the species, especially from the views of habitat patch and network structure? The Su-Xi-Chang Area of the Yangtze River Delta Area was selected as case study due to its rapid urban development and land use changes. In this research, the Egretta garzetta was selected as a regional representative species for the following three reasons: (1) marshland birds are the superior species among wild animals of the study area; (2) Egretta garzetta is the superior species among marshland birds which is on the list of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); (3) the data related to living and hunting habitats of Egretta garzetta in the study area are easy to get. Based on the study of the Egretta garzetta habitat, we developed a Conceptual Constraint Model of Species Habitat Patch (CCMSHP) and a method to select habitat patch properly from different land types. In CCMSHP, factors which affect the forming of species habitat were classified into three categories coarsely, which are physical, biological, and human disturbances. In each category, main specific constraints were obtained from previous results and transferred suitably from the calculation supported by the ArcGIS software. Based on the identified Egretta garzetta habitats, their habitat networks were accordingly developed. Then, landscape metrics and network structure indicators were applied to analyze the effect of land use change on the mapped-out habitat network. The results showed that: (1) the total area of patches suitable for Egretta garzetta’s living and hunting was increased during the period from 2000 to 2010; however, the quality of the habitat network was decreased seriously due to the strong negative effect of newly-built constructions, such as expressways and high-speed railways. (2) The habitat network of Egretta garzetta is only a small part of the whole area which consists of four separate fractions. They were Yixing-Liyang Part, Binhu Part, Wuzhong Part, and Yangchenghu Part and ranked down respectively, according to their conditions of 2000. During the recent ten years, these fractions have been seriously destroyed. Among of them, Yixing-Liyang Part was in the worst condition and then following by Binhu, Wuzhong and Yangchenghu Part. In a summary, during the past ten years, the condition of Egretta garzetta habitat environment was becoming worse; and the land use change has affected the survival of Egretta garzetta badly. We suggest that the protection both of high and low-level patches in hierarchy is important and it is necessary to identify and rebuilt those disappeared low-level patches to improve the quality of habitat network. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

The aim of our study is to provide insight into the local-scale urban movement habits of Long-eared Owls. Our study was carried out between 2015 and 2019 in the autumn and winter period, by observations in the early evening and by ringing and recapture of owls in the town of Sombor (NE Serbia). We observed owls when leaving the roosting site located in the town centre following the greenery of the larger avenues towards the outskirts. Owls were sporadically observed in densely built areas of the town, narrow streets with less greenery. Ringing and recapture data suggest that owls were closely linked to the green corridors. They probably used these corridors for easier orientation and to prey on birds roosting in trees in the town, such as sparrows (Passer domesticus, P. montanus), Common Blackbirds (Turdus merula) or Fieldfares (T. pilaris) appearing in harsh winters, and sometimes also pigeons. © 2020 Thomas Oliver Méro et al., published by Sciendo 2020.",10.2478/orhu-2020-0014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112108876&doi=10.2478%2forhu-2020-0014&partnerID=40&md5=10df30de3c7d89feee09b62ab3110591,28,2,town avenues as flight corridors for long-eared owls (asio otus),10.2478/orhu-2020-0014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112108876&doi=10.2478%2forhu-2020-0014&partnerID=40&md5=10df30de3c7d89feee09b62ab3110591

To differentiate the potential effectiveness of 2 frequently used strategies for increasing the connectivity of populations in fragmented landscapes-corridors and stepping stones-we combined 3 complimentary methods: behavioral studies at habitat edges, mark-recapture, and genetic analyses. Each of these methods addresses different steps in the dispersal process that a single intensive study could not address. We applied the 3 methods to the case study of Atrytonopsis new species 1, a rare butterfly endemic to a partially urbanized stretch of barrier islands in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Results of behavioral analyses showed the butterfly flew into urban and forested areas, but not over open beach; mark-recapture showed that the butterfly dispersed successfully through short stretches of urban areas ( 5 km) were a dispersal barrier, but shorter stretches of urban areas (≤5 km) were not. Although results from all 3 methods indicated natural features in the landscape, not urbanization, were barriers to dispersal, when we combined the results we could determine where barriers might arise: forests restricted dispersal for the butterfly only when there were long stretches with no habitat. Therefore, urban areas have the potential to become a dispersal barrier if their extent increases, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if we had used a single approach. Protection of stepping stones should be sufficient to maintain connectivity for Atrytonopsis new species 1 at current levels of urbanization.

Observations were made weekly from four study sites where ducks would congregate at early morning hours. Factors contributing to the presence of waterfowl in Puyallyup included abundant food supplies and a creek corridor that connected fragmented habitats in the urban area to the larger rural populations of waterfowl. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were the most abundant of the 13 species observed and were the only ducks remaining during the nesting season. Habitat size and complexity were important factors influencing the species diversity of a particular site. Nesting success of mallards was poor due to limited distribution of nesting habitat, intraspecific aggression, and human disturbance.

Reconstructing the ecological networks is greatly critical to the improvement of the regional ecosystem services, as well as the maintaining of biodiversity and landscape diversity. For the reconstruction of the ecological safety network of Xuzhou City, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and landscape index were used to extract the ecological sources with great value for the maintenance of urban ecosystems health. Then, the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCR) was used to build ecological resistance surfaces and extract the potential ecological corridors. Circuit theory combined with the graph theory and network structure analysis were used to quantitatively evaluate and optimize the ecological network. The results show that there are 237 ecological sources, mainly distributed in the southwest part of Xuzhou City, with a total area of 6 421. 49 hm2. However, additional 70 small ecological habitats and 192 ecological corridors should be added to make up the deficiencies of current ecological network. The reconstruction of ecological network could obviously reduce the landscape fragmentation and patch separation, and increase the patch connectivity and adhesion degree, and as a result the regional landscape pattern and ecological security will be improved.

Owing to the complex, potentially nonlinear relationship between urban ecological systems and biophysical surface components in megacities, selecting the right quantitative models to evaluate their urban ecological quality is not always clear. Six typical megacities inside and outside China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, London, New York, and Tokyo) were taken as examples. 7 ecological indicators, including Air Quality Index (AQI), Road Density (RD), Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI), Wetness, Greenness, Dryness, and Heat, were integrated to a new model named as urban remote sensing ecological index (URSEI) using principal component analysis. The URSEI was used to quantitatively evaluate the ecological quality of Chinese and foreign megacities. Results show that London had the best ecological quality (0.542), followed by Guangzhou (0.533), Beijing (0.517), New York (0.511) and Shanghai (0.495). Tokyo had the lowest ecological quality (0. 445). Comparing the 7 indices within the URSEI, the ECI, Wetness and Greenness indices had positive effects on the ecology, while the AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat indices had negative effects. London and Guangzhou had high ECI and Greenness values and low AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat values. Hence, they had better ecological quality than those of the other four megacities. According to the spatial distribution of the URSEI, urban centers that were covered by high ratio of impervious surfaces and low ratio of vegetation had low ecological connectivity between the ecological land patches and had severe heat island effects and air pollution, which resulted in poor ecological quality. Areas covered by large amounts of vegetation had high Greenness and ECI values, and low Dryness, Heat and AQI values, which helped to improve the ecological quality. The URSEI can be used both as a quantitative indicator to describe the re-gional ecological quality, and to describe the spatial difference in the ecological quality of megacities. © 2021, China Environmental Science Press.

The construction of ecological network can mitigate the damage caused by the rapid urbanization and the fragmentation of urban and rural landscapes and is of great significance for the protection of urban biodiversity.Method: This paper selects Yanqing District of Beijing as the research area. Based on the ArcGIS software platform, the remote sensing image of Yanqing District of Beijing was interpreted to obtain the land cover type. The land cover type was divided into foreground and background by the ArcGIS. The analysis method (MSPA) obtained seven types of landscape types and identified the core area as an important ecological source. The accumulative cost distance model and the network analysis were used to obtain the ecological network under the best threshold. Based on this, the ecological network optimization proposal of Yanqing District was proposed.Result: (1) The overall fragmentation degree in Yanqing District was low, the material and energy migration among different types were relatively smooth and the overall landscape diversity was higher, but the number of habitat patches in the city was less and the corridor was scarce; (2) the distance threshold, which was most suitable for the current structure of the ecological network in Yanqing District was 20 000 m and the network closure degree α was 0.73; (3) woodland and cultivated land were important landscape types of potential ecological corridors in the study area and forest area was the largest, it was 17 452.9 ha, accounting for 81.1% of the total corridor area.Conclusion: The MSPA method has the advantages of accurate and detailed evaluation of geometric connectivity, small amount of data required and visualization of analysis results. The network analysis method could optimize the ecological network. Therefore, based on the MSPA method and network analysis method, the accuracy of the ecological network construction in Yanqing District is more detailed and accurate.

In this study, the central urban area of a typical multi-mountainous city (Guiyang, China) was taken as research area. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristic indicators system of USMS was constructed. The InVEST model was used to evaluate the HQ in the study area, and the spatial pattern characteristics of USMS and HQ in the multi-mountainous city were analyzed. Finally, the response relationship of HQ to USMS was revealed through Pearson correlation analysis and curve fitting. The results showed that: (1) The average level of HQ in the study area is low and the spatial aggregation effect is obvious; the spatial distribution difference between the high value area and the low value area is significant; the high value area is mainly distributed in the area where the large area of urban green space (UGS) and the urban remnant mountains (URMs) are located, while the low value area is mainly distributed in the high-intensity urban construction area. (2)The URMs have a significant impact on the USMS within the city, the intelligibility(I), spatial permeability, spatial aggregation degree, and spatial traffic attraction potential were poor; the buffer zone within 4 km of the urban center is the core area of urban development, and the buffer zone within 15 km is the rapid urban development area. (3)Among the USMS indicators, Choice(C) was significantly positively correlated with the HQ, while the Connectivity(Con), I, Average height(AVH), and Otherness(O) were significantly negatively correlated with the HQ. (4)Stepwise regression results showed that USMS could explain the difference of HQ in the study area well, and the values of fitting coefficient R2 were 0.975, 0.837 and 0.945 in 2008, 2013 and 2018, respectively.

In instances where conflicts have occurred land managers have been licensed to remove nests and eggs and cull adults at a site scale. With the increase in urban populations and local management of the species, there is a need to understand how ibis are using urban resources and how they move through the urban landscape to identify important resources. To gain a better understanding of the connectedness of local urban populations, we fitted 82 birds with radio transmitters at three common habitats: an urban park, a breeding colony and a landfill. Over a period of 48 weeks we found 45% of birds made movements greater than 10. km, with 13% moving greater than 30. km. Ibis were located at up to nine foraging and seven roost sites, demonstrating the connectedness of the population across the study region. Landfills were identified as a major food resource with 63% of ibis (n = 82) located therein, while parks supported local foraging with only 27% of ibis (n = 82) located therein.

Accordingly, conservation planning for this species needs to be assessed on a regional basis, not on a localized case-by-case basis.

To investigate how fragmentation of tropical forest affects population connectivity in a forest specialist bird species, we optimized resistance surfaces without a priori specification, using least-cost (LCP) or resistance (IBR) distances. We implemented a two-step procedure in order (i) to objectively define the landscape thematic resolution (level of detail in classification scheme to describe landscape variables) and spatial extent (area within the landscape boundaries) and then (ii) to test the relative role of several landscape features (elevation, roads, land cover) in genetic differentiation in the Plumbeous Warbler (Setophaga plumbea). We detected a small-scale reduction of gene flow mainly driven by land cover, with a negative impact of the nonforest matrix on landscape functional connectivity. However, matrix components did not equally constrain gene flow, as their conductivity increased with increasing structural similarity with forest habitat: urban areas and meadows had the highest resistance values whereas agricultural areas had intermediate resistance values. Our results revealed a higher performance of IBR compared to LCP in explaining gene flow, reflecting suboptimal movements across this human-modified landscape, challenging the common use of LCP to design habitat corridors and advocating for a broader use of circuit theory modelling.

Most green roof biodiversity studies have not considered whether the roof height affects community composition and abundance of species present. This study focused on evaluating beetle diversity and abundance in relation to roof height, with emphasis on wildflower roofs. The key results of the study confirm previous studies found that extensive wildflower green roofs are capable of supporting fairly rich beetle communities, including some rare/scarce species. However, an increase of roof height was found to negatively impact both beetle abundance and richness, despite all recorded species being well adapted to active flight and thus dispersal. In addition forb cover decreased with roof height which consequently influenced beetle community structure. These results are therefore indicative that further research is required on species communities found on extensive green roofs that are less adapted to active flight and consequently vertical dispersal.

In fulfilling the vision and goal of building the world-leading harmonious and livable capital, Beijing attaches great importance to the perception and interaction of urban residents with urban ecological space, which is a vivid embodiment of the concept of landsenses ecology coupling the urban ecological space with the living environment quality and mental health. Ecological space is of great significance for maintaining regionally ecological security and biodiversity, improving the quality of human settlements, and promoting regionally sustainable development. This study analyzed the landscape pattern of the ecological space and visual space pattern in Shunyi District combining the idea of landsense creation in landsenses ecology with the ecological planning practice of Shunyi District. The results show that in terms of the landscape pattern of the ecological space, the proportion of the ecological space dominated by forest, grassland, farmland and wetland has reached 6 5 %, but the patches of forest, grassland and wetland in Shunyi District were relatively fragmented. There are large patches of settlement near the Beijing Capital International Airport, and there are few forests and green spaces around the airport and the central city. In terms of visually spatial pattern, the highways and lower-grade roads in Shunyi District mostly have higher green view, the spatial distribution of green view in county roads is uneven, and the green view of roads in the center of the district is generally low. Overall, the length of the road sections with the medium and lower-medium green view was nearly 6 0 %, and there were fewer road sections having the above-average green view, especially the high-level green view. Therefore, there remain large room for improving the ecological service by landsenses creation. Furthermore, this study aimed to improve the urban ecological space services of Shunyi District and summarized four core visions of ecological space landscape pattern optimization, visual space pattern optimization, scientific planning and management of ecological space, and comprehensive improvement of ecosystem services. Based on the four visions, the targeted measures for landscape creation were proposed, including strengthening the ecological protection of shallow mountainous areas, constructing leisure and recreation zone along the shallow mountains and Chaobai River, increasing the quality of the visual space of Shunyi District, improving the ecological space leisure and recreation services in Shunyi District, clarifying the urban ecological space planning, strictly observing the ecological protection red line, improving landscape diversity, and constructing ecological corridors, etc. © 2020 Science Press.

How has this large, slow-moving reptile managed to persist in the suburbs? We implanted radio-transmitters into 17 adult blue-tongued lizards and tracked them for six months (October 1998 to March 1999). Radio-tracked animals utilised 5-17 suburban backyards, but each lizard spent most of its time in a few 'core' areas near 2-7 shelter sites. Males had larger home ranges than females (mean of 12700 v. 5100 m2) and moved further between shelter sites. Gravid females (mean home range 1000 m2) were more sedentary. Lizards used corridors of dense vegetation to move between retreat sites, and actively avoided crossing roads. In sunny weather, lizards typically basked close to their overnight shelter for 1-4 h each morning until they obtained body temperatures of approximately 32°C. They maintained high body temperatures while moving about in the afternoon. In combination, the following ecological factors may facilitate persistence of blue-tongued lizards at our suburban study sites. (i) The most important subgroup of the population in terms of conservation are gravid females, which are highly sedentary and, thus, less likely to encounter the dangers of suburbia. (ii) The more 'expendable' males move about much more, but mostly in times and places that involve minimal risk from humans and their domestic pets. (iii) Lizards show strong site fidelity, spending up to 70% of their time in 'safe' locations; importantly, they avoid roads. (iv) Blue-tongued lizards readily utilise 'artificial' shelter sites and the commensal prey species (e.g. snails) found in most gardens. (v) These lizards can grow rapidly, mature early, and produce large litters.

This study draws attention to the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape ecological risk and constructs an ecological security pattern of Yinchuan City in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, by employing land use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020; analyzing the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of landscape ecological risk based on landscape ecological risk assessment; and studying the ecological risk evolution rule of different land use. This study proposes the ecological security pattern and ecological security protection strategies using the landscape ecological risk index (ERI) and the minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Meanwhile, in order to reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, the paper used core ecological sources which had areas greater than 10 km2 and were mainly distributed in natural protected areas such as Helan Mountain and Baijitan National Nature Reserve. It chose six resistance factors, including landscape ERI, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from road, and distance from water to calculate the resistance value. Based on ecological sources and resistance, the minimal cumulative resistance value was obtained by MCR and the ecological corridors and ecological nodes were identified preliminarily. Finally, the preliminary ecological security pattern was optimized, combined with land use map of 2020 and the MCR value, and the ecological security strategies were proposed. The results show that: (1) Landscape ecological risk in Yinchuan City shows the distribution characteristics, are high in which the middle and north but low in the south is low. The average ERIs of 2000, 2010, and 2020 are 0.2155, 0.2145, and 0.2130, respectively, which indicates an overall downward trend in the landscape ecological risk has appeared in the past 20 years and an ecological risk level moving from high to low.

Conversion of natural areas to land dominated by human use results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment or even extinction. Recently, reserve site selection models have begun to integrate spatial attributes in order to design more compact and connected reserve networks that are thought to improve long-term species persistence. While these models are a good step forward to designing conservation reserve networks, they might not be adequate for use in exurban areas that consist of heterogeneous mosaics of land uses where habitat fragmentation already exists and not all parcels are available for preservation. This paper presents a species conservation framework that expands upon traditional reserve site selection models in three ways. First, because of the focus on exurban areas, the framework used here allows for land conversion within core habitat patches. Second, the framework provides a more robust assessment of connectivity among patches by accounting for land-use heterogeneity in the dispersal matrix. And third, the framework explicitly incorporates species population dynamics. We apply our conservation framework to the case of pond-breeding salamanders in an exurban community in Rhode Island, USA. Comparisons are made between the outcomes for uniform conservation policies and more flexible policies that accommodate ecological and economic heterogeneity. As expected, policies that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process are less costly in terms of foregone development. Conservation planners should consider core habitat patches, dispersal matrix, and spatial scale in their decision making. By not assessing the potential impact of dispersal barriers, reserve site selection models will result in conservation plans that may not protect species over the long term, particularly for species residing in highly fragmented landscapes such as those found in many exurban communities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The vegetation change of urban built-up areas in the study area from 2002 to 2013 was studied from five aspects: sum, mean, ratio and its change amount, interannual change rate, percentage and stability of NDVI. The results showed that: 1) As one of the effective methods to extract urban built-up area, the statistical data comparison method had high accuracy in our study area, and the error rate was within 6.7%. 2) The urban land formed a discontinuous spatial pattern of “几” around the Hexi Corridor and the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and had three different distribution patterns: point, line and plane. 3) The annual average rate and dynamic degree of urban expansion showed an upward trend, and the rate of urban expansion during 2010—2013 (4.53 km2 / a) was twice as high as that during 2006—2010. 4) Except for Jiuquan, Haixi, Baiyin, Tianshui, Shizuishan and Lanzhou, the compactness index of other urban build-up areas was relatively high. 5) In the first stage (2002—2006) and the second stage (2006—2010), the center of gravity shifted northward, and in the third stage (2010—2013), the center of gravity shifted southward. 6) The total NDVI of urban built-up area increased with the increase of built-up area. 7) The vegetation in urban built-up areas showed a positive trend on the whole. From the perspective of the mean NDVI, the vegetation condition got worse from 2002 to 2006, and improved from 2006 to 2013. Moreover, the mean NDVI distribution showed obvious spatial differences, and the central and western regions were generally smaller than the eastern ones. From the perspective of the interannual variation rate and percentage of NDVI, the built-up area of each city was larger than the peripheral background area. 8) The vegetation status in urban built-up areas was generally worse than that in background areas, and the NDVI ratio and its variation in nearly 4/ 7 urban built-up areas showed a downward trend from 2002 to 2013. 9) Vegetation stability in urban built-up areas was poor, and the variation coefficients of more than half of the cities increased to varying degrees in the past 12 years. © 2022 Science Press.

This study analyzed MODIS NDVI remote sensing data and identified the temporal-spatial dynamics of vegetation coverage during 2005-2015 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan regions. The analysis methods included linear regression, coefficient of variation, R/S analysis, and other mathematical methods. The results showed that (1) the vegetation coverage increased by 0.065 from 2005 to 2015. The vegetation restoration experienced a stable fluctuation phase after two fast-improving periods. (2) The significantly improved area occupied 47.45% of the region and the insignificant area accounted for 33.9% of the region, which was mainly in the North China Plain. The degraded area accounted for 6.8% of the region and was scattered in the surroundings of big cities. (3) The sustainability of vegetation restoration was dominant (58.8%) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The vegetation area of anti-sustainability accounted for 34.4%, mainly distributed in Zhangjiakou, Cangzhou, and the south-east of Baoding. The continuous degradation area was only 4.8% of the region and distributed in the cities of Tianjin, Langfang, and Cangzhou.

The expansion of urban areas promotes drastic ecological changes, especially through fragmentation of natural areas. Natural grassland remnants surrounded by an urban matrix are more likely to undergo disturbance events. Since grassland ecosystems are closely related to disturbances such as fire and grazing, grassland plant communities, pollinators, and their interaction networks may be especially sensitive to urban expansion, because it promotes habitat fragmentation and modifies disturbance regimes. This work evaluated the effect of the level of urbanization and recent history of fire disturbance on grassland plants communities and plant-floral visitor mutualistic networks. We sampled plant communities and floral visitors in 12 grassland sites with different levels of urbanization and time since the last fire event. Sites with higher levels of urbanization showed higher values for plant species richness, floral visitor richness, and network asymmetry. All sampled networks were significantly nested (with one exception), asymmetric, and specialized. In addition, all networks presented more modules than expected by chance. The frequency of fire disturbance events increased with the level of urbanization. Since grassland ecosystems depend on disturbances to maintain their structure and diversity, we inferred that the history of fire disturbance was the mechanism behind the relationship between urbanization and our biological descriptors.

In view of this, this paper referred to the principle and basis of land sample selection, laid out the typical sample belt of Hebei Province, and used the minimum cumulative resistance model, with the forest land, grassland and wetland of the sample belt as the ecological source land, and the artificial surface as the source of urban expansion. In terms of attributes and external attributes, five indicators - elevation, land landscape type, soil type, ecological sensitivity, and ecosystem service value - have been selected to investigate the ecological security pattern of land use. The findings were as follows: five ecological safety areas were designated for the typical sample area in Hebei Province; these were ecological core area, ecological buffer area, ecological transition area, ecological occupation area, and ecological management area. The spatial pattern distribution of ecological source areas and urban expansion sources showed clear boundaries, all of which were concentrated and contiguous, though the ecological connectivity was weak. The ecological core area, which was the core area of the nature reserve, was at least 1 082.42 km2. The buffer area, which was the medium connecting the upper, middle and lower reaches, was as much as 6 943.63 km2. This area should be used rationally for protection. The ecological transition area, which was the key area for the development and construction of the reserve following the urban and rural construction, was 3 189.25 km2. The ecological occupation area, with an area of 5 835.34 km2, was distributed in the ecological transition area and the ecological governance zone. It was the main area of urban construction and economic development. The ecological management area was 1 710.70 km2; it was primarily an ecologically fragile area and was a key region for ecological restoration and future ecological industry development. In summary, There should be a large-scale planting of the ecological core area and the ecological buffer zone. The ecological transition area should be controlled strictly to expand to the ecological land, and the ecological occupation area should be developed according to the needs of the urban population and the economy. It is necessary to return farmland to the lake to restore the water surface, strictly to the soil environmental safety bottom line, and optimize the ecological safety barrier system. © 2019, Science Press.

The area of the vectored polygons was obtained and a classified, and then the calculation was made with the nearest neighbor index, mean distance observed, Patton diversity index and the perimeter/area ratio of forest fragments. The results show that most of the fragments have an area smaller than 1 ha, the fragments with more significant area (<50 ha) represent more than 16% of the native vegetation area. The small fragments are important to maintain the connectivity, since the withdrawal of these increases the mean distance observed and nearest neighbor index. Most of the fragments are elongated and amorphous in accordance with the perimeter/area ratio and the Patton diversity index respectively, this may demonstrate the fragments may be subject to edge effects.

This study uses GIS analysis and spatial statistics to explore the configuration of 1900 residential open spaces in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the northeastern United States. It examines local characteristics such as open space policy, subdivision features, and socioeconomic status to identify variables that are associated with open space parcel size and connectivity and could be leveraged to foster a more beneficial configuration of metropolitan green space. The analysis finds that open space is moderately fragmented, but is abundant in the county and clustered, which could support functional connectivity. Direct connections also considerably augment the size of open spaces and other types of protected greenspaces.

Many populations of pond-Breeding amphibians are assumed to follow metapopulation dynamics, and connectivity is mostly measured between breeding ponds. However, the habitat of pond-Breeding amphibians is not only defined by the pond but, typically, consists of a breeding pond surrounded by clusters of disjoint summer-habitat patches interspersed with an agricultural/semi-urban matrix. We hypothesise that the internal structure of a habitat patch may change connectivity in two ways: (i) by affecting animal movements and thereby emigration and immigration probabilities; and (ii) by affecting habitat quality and population size. To test our hypotheses, we apply a spatially explicit individual-Based model of Moor frog dispersal. We find that the realised connectivity depends on internal structure of both the target and the source patch as well as on how habitat quality is affected by patch structure. Although fragmentation is generally thought to have negative effects on connectivity, our results suggest that, depending on patch structure and habitat quality, positive effects on connectivity may occur. © Author(s) 2013.",10.5194/we-13-21-2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901752939&doi=10.5194%2fwe-13-21-2013&partnerID=40&md5=16d97ecc0ee427dabf4f3611132dc8b0,13,2,effects of within-patch heterogeneity on connectivity in pond-breeding amphibians studied by means of an individual-based model,10.5194/we-13-21-2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901752939&doi=10.5194%2fwe-13-21-2013&partnerID=40&md5=16d97ecc0ee427dabf4f3611132dc8b0

Until recently, limited consideration has been given to modelling the effects of the landscape context (e.g. habitat area, habitat configuration and roads). Yet, the combined influence of natural habitats and anthropogenic impacts at multiple spatial scales are likely to be important determinants of where koala populations occur and remain viable in human-modified landscapes. The study tested the importance of multiscale habitat variables on koala occurrence in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The models focused at three spatial scales: site (< 1 ha), patch (1-100 ha), and landscape (100-1000 s ha). Logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses were used to rank alternative models and key explanatory variables. The results showed that an increased likelihood of koala presence in fragmented landscapes in the urban-forest interface (as opposed to larger blocks of forest habitat) can best be explained by the positive effects of soil fertility and the presence of preferred koala tree species in these fragmented areas. If koalas are to be effectively conserved in Ballarat, it is critical to (i) protect remaining core areas of high-quality habitat, including regenerating areas; (ii) protect scattered habitat patches which provide connectivity; and (iii) develop and implement habitat restoration programmes to improve habitat connectivity and enhance opportunities for safe koala movement between habitat patches intersected by main roads. © 2008 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/j.1442-8903.2008.00405.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48249154580&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-8903.2008.00405.x&partnerID=40&md5=96d5221564320a8819421d5763d86aa5,9,7,"identifying multiscale habitat factors influencing koala (phascolarctos cinereus) occurrence and management in ballarat, victoria, australia",10.1111/j.1442-8903.2008.00405.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48249154580&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-8903.2008.00405.x&partnerID=40&md5=96d5221564320a8819421d5763d86aa5

Four of our eight guilds have fared significantly better within our study area: waterbirds (24 species), those feeding on invertebrates (16 species), woodland specialists (21 species) and the two species that decorate their nests with lichens. The remaining four guilds showed no difference between Halton and Warrington and the rest of Cheshire and Wirral: raptors (5 species) have increased throughout, while breeding waders (7 species), farmland seedeaters (7 species) and aerial insectivores (5 species) have declined throughout.

Total abundance of mammalian nest predators increased significantly as forest corridor width decreased. We found no relationship between categorical measures of land-use and total abundance of mammalian nest predators. Specific attributes of the landscape adjacent to the greenway, however, did have an effect. Greenways adjacent to landscapes with fewer buildings had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators. The abundance of individual species varied with the amount of canopy, lawn, and pavement in the adjacent landscape. Some measures of habitat structure of greenways also were correlated with the abundance of mammalian nest predators. Greenway segments with wider trails had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators, as did segments with a higher percentage of mature forest. No habitat structure variables were significant for all species. To reduce the overall risk of avian nest predation by mammals, forested greenways should be designed with wider forest corridors and narrower, unpaved trails. Some greenway characteristics that favor high-nest predator populations also favor birds of conservation concern. Similarly, some characteristics correlated with lower predator occurrence are also correlated with lower abundance of birds of conservation concern. Thus, management of greenways and the surrounding landscape must balance reduction of predator communities with the promotion of desired bird communities and other conservation goals. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial pattern of urban impervious surface density is an important factor affecting the waterlogging. This paper aims to provide a new method to optimize the spatial pattern of impervious surface in order to reduce urban waterlogging by the integration of SCS-CN model and the Ant colony algorithm. Firstly, the density of urban impervious surface was estimated by remote sensing images through the method of linear spectral mixing modeling. Secondly, the CN value was corrected by using the Williams formula. Then, the modified SCS-CN model was used to calculate the surface runoff. Thirdly, according to the goal of minimizing runoff coefficient, the spatial pattern of impervious surface of 18 runoff plots was optimized by Ant colony algorithm. Fourthly, landscape pattern indices were used to analyze the spatial pattern of impervious surface. The results show that: in rainfall reappearing periods of 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years and 100 years, the optimized impervious surface pattern could reduce the runoff coefficient by 21.19%, 19.58%, 19.38%, 18.93%, 18.41% and 17.25%, respectively. Based on the experimental results above, this research puts forward three suggestions for the optimization of urban renewal. ① Increase the area of grassland, garden, trees and other vegetation types to reduce the high impervious surface area which can be further divided into patches of lower levels of impervious surface. ② Gather low and medium-to-low types of impervious surface to increase the connectivity and the medium-to-high levels of impervious surface. ③ Increase the quantity and density of patches in each runoff plot and reduce the degree of spread and aggregation. © 2017, Science Press.

Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators. Aims. The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban-forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban-forest gradient. Methods. Using a total of 683 independent field-and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls. Key results. Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76% of the forest landscape to 21% of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban-forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation. Conclusions. Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient. Implications. High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators.",10.1071/WR13087,NA,40,4,response of a cryptic apex predator to a complete urban to forest gradient,10.1071/WR13087,NA

Currently, urban expansion is an important driver of land-use change in the basin. A land transformation model was applied to the basin to forecast land use from 2000 to 2020. We assessed the effect of this projected land-use change scenario on five forest rodent species at three scales: using occupancy models at the patch level, proportional occupancy models at the landscape level, and ecologically scaled landscape indices to assess the change in connectivity at the watershed level. At the patch and landscape scales, occupancy models had low predictability but suggest that gray squirrels are most susceptible to land-use change. At the watershed scale, declines in connectivity did not correspond with the decline of forest. This study highlights the importance of map resolution and consideration of matrix elements in constructing forecast models.

Time for action,Global Ecology and Conservation,"pastsearch, scopus",e02295,"European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced ca. 40 years ago to South America, where they naturalized to central and northern Argentina, now reaching some neighboring countries. While Patagonia (southern Argentina and Chile) has remained free of European starlings (ES) in the past, they are now present along its northern boundary. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the factors explaining this recent invasion, and 2) predict how starlings might expand across southernmost America based on niche modeling using landform, land cover, and climatic variables representing conditions that may limit ES. Based on records from community science, informants, and our own observations, we conclude that two parallel processes generated new population nodes in northern Patagonia: 1) a southwards expansion from their core areas near the Atlantic coast (generating an incipient population node in NE Patagonia), and 2) birds released or escaped from captivity (generating an isolated population node in north-central Patagonia). Community science data was most useful from 2018 onwards, while data from informants was key to understand previous events (e.g., first ES confiscated from illegal trade in 2008; first free ranging ES seen in 2014). The most parsimonious model confirmed our prediction that human transformed lands in several portions within the target area are suitable for ES establishment, both in Chile and Argentina. Null suitability was modeled for the lands in southernmost Patagonia (all cover types). Desert lands (Patagonian steppe, Monte Desert, High Andes) that skirt the Andean temperate forests on the north, and most of the Andean forests, turned out to be unsuitable (especially with increasing latitude). Conversely, most of coastal Argentine Patagonia and the human-transformed lands of south-central Chile emerged as moderately suitable habitat for ES. Because the riverine areas under current ES colonization in northern Patagonia are fovourable for ES (i.e., agricultural and urban lands with abundant nesting sites), without control actions, this species might soon spread over ca. 5000 km2 around the Colorado and Negro rivers, affecting their agricultural industry. These rivers, which run west-east through desert lands unsuitable for ES, now represent corridors into south-Andean ecosystems, as they are surrounded by treed land (willows and poplars introduced from Europe) not originally available, connecting formerly separate ecoregions. In case ES manage to reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, they might cross to Chile through low elevation passes (<1000 masl) available south of ca. 38°S. The valleys of south-central Chile are both suitable habitat for ES and valuable productive lands that may be threatened by the invasion. We present management suggestions, and advocate for the development of a bi-national strategy to retard, prevent and alleviate the far-reaching impacts ES may exert on America's southernmost ecosystems and resources. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139013361&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02295&partnerID=40&md5=a0c6b3e5755e3e297f3e5dbfb1b5c3c4,39,5,european starlings expand into patagonia. time for action,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139013361&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02295&partnerID=40&md5=a0c6b3e5755e3e297f3e5dbfb1b5c3c4

We investigated the influence of protected areas (PAs), agriculture and urbanisation on the occupancy of mammal communities in an anthropogenic matrix containing indigenous forest fragments of the Coastal Belt of southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We integrated camera-trap mammal data, land-use and human population density within occupancy models, and compared occupancy of individual species across the land-use mosaic. We modelled occupancy of seven mammal species with sufficient na < ve occupancy (> 0.20, range 0.25-0.87). The occupancy of Philantomba monticola was positively influenced by human population size and was higher within urban areas compared with PAs. Although human population size positively affected Hystrix africaeaustralis occupancy, it along with Atilax paludinosus had a lower occupancy within urban areas. Tragelaphus scriptus and Potamochoerus larvatus overall had higher and Sylvicapra grimmia had lower occupancies within PAs. Species were variable in their response to the anthropogenic changes in the landscape. For example, occupancy of P. monticola was low within PAs but high in areas where change in land ownership and loss of habitat are threats. For other species, it appeared that the density of infrastructure of the urban landscape, rather than human population density, affected them negatively.

We present an adjusted multidimensional spatial human footprint index (SHFI) to analyze the effects of landscape transformation on the remnant habitat connectivity for 40 terrestrial mammal species representative of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic System in Michoacan (TMVSMich), in western central Mexico. We adjusted the SHFI by adding fragmentation and habitat loss to its original three components: land use intensity, time of human landscape intervention, and biophysical vulnerability. The adjusted SHFI was applied to four scenarios: one grouping all species and three grouping several species by habitat spatial requirements. Using the SHFI as a dispersal resistance surface and applying a circuit theory based approach, we analyzed the effects of cumulative human impact on habitat connectivity in the different scenarios. For evaluating the relationship between habitat loss and connectivity, we applied graph theory-based equivalent connected area (ECA) index. Results show over 60% of the TMVSMich has high SHFI values, considerably lowering current flow for all species. Nevertheless, the effect on connectivity of human impact is higher for species with limited dispersal capacity (100–500 m).

We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats. We mapped land cover using Landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 × 6 km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models. Leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially.

One common approach for determining corridor locations is least-cost corridor (LCC) modeling, which uses algorithms within a geographic information system to search for routes with the lowest cumulative resistance between target locations on a landscape. However, the presentation of multiple LCCs that connect multiple locations generally assumes all corridors contribute equally to connectivity, regardless of the likelihood that animals will use them. Thus, LCCs may overemphasize seldom-used longer routes and underemphasize more frequently used shorter routes. We hypothesize that, depending on conservation objectives and available biological information, weighting individual corridors on the basis of species-specific movement, dispersal, or gene flow data may better identify effective corridors. We tested whether locations of key connectivity areas, defined as the highest 75th and 90th percentile cumulative weighted value of approximately 155,000 corridors, shift under different weighting scenarios. In addition, we quantified the amount and location of private land that intersect key connectivity areas under each weighting scheme. Some areas that appeared well connected when analyzed with unweighted corridors exhibited much less connectivity compared with weighting schemes that discount corridors with large effective distances. Furthermore, the amount and location of key connectivity areas that intersected private land varied among weighting schemes. We believe biological assumptions and conservation objectives should be explicitly incorporated to weight corridors when assessing landscape connectivity.

There is a drive to develop quantitative, comparable metrics of success to improve conservation interventions. Yet the qualitative, normative choices inherent in decisions about what to measure — emerging from fundamental philosophical commitments about what conservation is and should be — have received scant attention. We address this gap by exploring perceptions of what constitutes a successful biodiversity corridor in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, an area of global biodiversity significance. Biodiversity corridors are particularly illustrative because, as interventions intended to extend conservation practices from protected areas across broader landscapes, they represent prisms in which ideas of conservation success are contested and transformed. We use Q method to elicit framings of success among 20 conservation scientists, practitioners and community representatives, and find three statistically significant framings of successful corridors: ‘a last line of defence for biodiversity under threat,’ ‘a creative process to develop integrative, inclusive visions of biodiversity and human wellbeing,’ and ‘a stimulus for place-based cultural identity and economic development.’ Our results demonstrate that distinct understandings of what a corridor is — a planning tool, a process of governing, a territorialized place — produce divergent framings of ‘successful’ corridors that embody diverse, inherently contestable visions of conservation. These framings emerge from global conservation discourses and distinctly local ecologies, politics, cultures and histories.

To evaluate the potential of very high-resolution imagery (WorldView-2, 30-cm resolution) to fill this gap, we sought to a) map contrasting urban vegetation cover types (grass, shrubs and woody vegetation) at the meter scale and with high accuracy, b) quantify the structural and functional connectivity of urban vegetation, and c) estimate the status of productive vegetation. We focused our analysis on land use and cover in the city of Xalapa in Veracruz, Mexico, and employed multiscale satellite imagery to estimate vegetation cover, connectivity, and health. We identified 38,579 patches of woody vegetation, of which 93 % corresponded to isolated trees contributing to 27 % of vegetation connectivity. Without woody vegetation, the connectivity index decrease up to 97 %; removing grass or shrubs would reduce connectivity by 38 % or 32 %, respectively. We identified 10 patches disproportionately important to connectivity, of which seven had some type of legal protection. Across vegetation types, 38 % of the vegetated area was unhealthy.

Many species are found today in the form of fragmented populations occupying patches of remnant habitat in human-altered landscapes. The persistence of these population networks requires a balance between extinction and colonization events assumed to be primarily related to patch area and isolation, but the contribution of factors such as the characteristics of patch and matrix habitats, the species’ traits (habitat specialization and dispersal capabilities) and variation in climatic conditions have seldom been evaluated simultaneously. 2. The identification of environmental variables associated with patch occupancy and turnover may be especially useful to enhance the persistence of multiple species under current global change. However, for robust inference on occupancy and related parameters, we must account for detection errors, a commonly overlooked problem that leads to biased estimates and misleading conclusions about population dynamics. 3. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence of the effects of different environmental variables on the extinction and colonization rates of a rich butterfly community in the western Mediterranean. The analysis was based on a 17-year data set containing detection/nondetection data on 73 butterfly species for 26 sites in north-eastern Spain. Using multiseason occupancy models, which take into account species’ detectability, we were able to obtain robust estimates of local extinction and colonization probabilities for each species and test the potential effects of site covariates such as the area of suitable habitat, topographic variability, landscape permeability around the site and climatic variability in aridity conditions. 4. Results revealed a general pattern across species with local habitat composition and landscape features as stronger predictors of occupancy dynamics compared with topography and local aridity. Increasing area of suitable habitat in a site strongly decreased local extinction risks and, for a number of species, both higher amounts of suitable habitat and more permeable landscapes increased colonization rates. Nevertheless, increased topographic variability decreased the extinction risk of bad dispersers, a group of species with significantly lower colonization rates. 5. Our models predicted higher sensitivity of the butterfly assemblages to deterministic changes in habitat features rather than to stochastic weather patterns, with some relationships being clearly dependent on the species’ traits.",10.1111/1365-2656.12118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12118,83,8,"determinants of extinction-colonization dynamics in mediterranean butterflies: the role of landscape, climate and local habitat features",10.1111/1365-2656.12118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12118

We considered a real agroecosystem in northern Italy, based our analyses on graph-theory and habitat availability metrics, and focused on the Hazel Dormouse as the target species. We compared the connectivity increase resulting from (i) the simulated restoration of existing priority corridors, i.e., those with significant presence of forest but in which restoration actions would still result in considerable connectivity gains, or (ii) the simulated plantation of 30 hedgerows along new priority pathways, i.e., those areas with no current forest cover in which habitat creation would be more beneficial for connectivity. Implementing new priority pathways resulted in substantially larger connectivity gains (+ 38%) than when restoration efforts were concentrated in improving already existing corridors (+ 11%). Establishing hedgerows along new pathways allowed enhancing the complementary and functionality of the full set of landscape corridors and proved more efficient than just strengthening the areas where dispersal flows were already concentrated.

We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective.

In this manuscript, we present an approach to prioritize areas for preserving landscape connectivity by using the landscape matrix in central-western Mexico and the connectivity for habitat patches considering ensembles of different terrestrial organisms. We aggregated three multispecies connectivity scenarios into a composite corridor scenario. To evaluate which corridors were more important to multispecies connectivity, we used the composite corridor model based on two ways: (1) the contribution of habitat patches that the corridor connects to overall connectivity and (2) the corridor’s capability for facilitating movement across the network of patches. Habitat patches were classified according to their value for the conservation of multispecies connectivity by hybridizing circuit-based and spatial prioritization models for connectivity conservation. We developed current flow models for each species (n = 40) and combined them in four prioritization models corresponding to the three multispecies groups and an all-species group. We found that the corridors having the highest accumulated importance (CI ≥ 58) are located along the protected areas of Pico de Tancitaro and the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera de la Mariposa Monarca–RBMM, Spanish acronym), which have relatively similar spatial distributions corridors compared to areas with priority for conservation (relative rank test = 0.6).

Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-based models, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other non-target mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animal movement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data.

A critical step in the process is identifying resistance values for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of such information, expert-opinion is often used. However, the use of expert-opinion is seen as subjective, human-centric and unreliable. This study derived resistance values from grey squirrel habitat suitability models (HSM) in order to compare the utility and validity of this approach with more traditional, expert-led methods. Models were built and tested with MaxEnt, using squirrel presence records and a categorical land cover map for Cumbria, UK. Predictions on the likelihood of squirrel occurrence within each land cover type were inverted, providing resistance values which were used to parameterise a least-cost model. The resulting habitat networks were measured and compared to those derived from a least-cost model built with previously collated information from experts. The expert-derived and HSM-inferred least-cost networks differ in precision. The HSM-informed networks were smaller and more fragmented because of the higher resistance values attributed to most habitats. These results are discussed in relation to the applicability of both approaches for conservation and management objectives, providing guidance to researchers and practitioners attempting to apply and interpret a least-cost approach to mapping ecological networks.",10.1371/journal.pone.0112119,https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112119,9,5,defining landscape resistance values in least-cost connectivity models for the invasive grey squirrel: a comparison of approaches using expert-opinion and habitat suitability modelling,10.1371/journal.pone.0112119,https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112119

To maintain or increase connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches, conservation actions may focus on creating and maintaining reserves and/or influencing management on non-reserves. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, an intensively cultivated agricultural matrix, at four assumed, but ecologically realistic, anuran dispersal distances. We compared connectivity in the current landscape to the historical landscape and putative future landscapes, and evaluated the importance of individual and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape, where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has maintained connectivity in the current landscape by replacing destroyed wetlands, but these pits likely provide suboptimal habitat. Also, because there are fewer total wetlands (i.e., wetlands and irrigation reuse pits) in the current landscape than the historical landscape, and because the distribution of current wetlands is less clustered than that of historical wetlands, larger and longer dispersing, sometimes nonnative species may be favored over smaller, shorter dispersing species of conservation concern. Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves do not affect connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse pits; however, they likely provide the highest quality anuran habitat. To improve future levels of resilience in this wetland habitat network, management could focus on continuing to improve the conservation status of non-reserve wetlands, restoring wetlands at spatial scales that promote movements of shorter dispersing species, and further scrutinizing irrigation reuse pit removal by considering effects on functional connectivity for anurans, an emblematic and threatened group of organisms. However, broader conservation plans will need to give consideration to other wetland-dependent species, incorporate invasive species management, and address additional challenges arising from global change in social-ecological systems like the Rainwater Basin.",10.1890/13-1755.1,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-1755.1,24,4,the role of reserves and anthropogenic habitats for functional connectivity and resilience of ephemeral wetlands,10.1890/13-1755.1,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-1755.1

In most studies, the effects of fragmentation on such species are analyzed based on Euclidean inter-patch distances. This approach, however, ignores the role of the landscape matrix. Recently, therefore, functional distances that account for the composition of the landscape surrounding the habitat patches have been used more frequently as indicators for patch occupancy. However, the performance of functional and non-functional connectivity measures in predicting patch occupancy of such species has never been compared in a multi-species approach. Here we evaluate the effect of habitat connectivity on the patch occupancy of 13 habitat specialists from three different insect orders (Auchenorrhyncha, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera) in fragmented calcareous grasslands. In order to calculate functional distances we used four different sets of resistance values and rankings. We then modelled species’ occurrence using both Euclidean and functional (based on least-cost modelling) inter-patch distances as predictors. We found that functional connectivity measures provided better results than the non-functional approach. However, a functional connectivity measure that was based on very coarse land-cover data performed even better than connectivity measures that were based on much more detailed land-use data. In order to take into account possible effects of the landscape matrix on patch occupancy by habitat specialists, future metapopulation studies should use functional rather than Euclidean distances whenever possible. For practical applications, we recommend a ‘simple approach’ which requires only coarse land-cover data and in our study performed better than all other functional connectivity measures, even more complex ones.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.03.047,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X16301510,67,6,functional connectivity as an indicator for patch occupancy in grassland specialists,10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.03.047,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X16301510

Such rapid forest loss and associated fragmentation reduces the availability of suitable habitat for wildlife and creates dispersion barriers. Understanding the prevalence and impacts of this anthropogenic disturbance, and developing ways in which to mitigate such changes, is thus critical to the conservation of Borneo's wildlife. Here, we applied a path selection function with conditional logistic regression and used it to develop a resistance surface for a population of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) residing within a fragmented and human dominated landscape in Malaysian Borneo. We used cumulative resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analysis to predict how connectivity may change in response to four future scenarios involving conversion of remaining unproductive forest to palm oil plantations, conversion of unproductive palm oil back to forest, and restoration of a riparian buffer zone along the river, and combination of the two forest restoration scenarios. We showed that Sunda clouded leopard movement is facilitated by forest canopy cover and resisted by non-forest vegetation, particularly recently cleared/planted and underproductive (flooded) plantation areas with low canopy closure. By combining resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path modelling we mapped core areas and the main linkages among them, and identified several key pinch points that may limit regional connectivity of the population. We predict that Sunda clouded leopard connectivity in the region can be greatly enhanced through the protection of privately owned forest patches and the reforestation of underproductive oil palm plantation areas, and creation of a forested buffer zone along the river. Conversely, we show that if the region's unprotected forests were to be converted to plantations then connectivity across the Kinabatangan floodplain would be significantly reduced.",10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.016,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717317652,222,8,evaluating scenarios of landscape change for sunda clouded leopard connectivity in a human dominated landscape,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.016,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717317652

Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale.

While road verges can be habitat for a large number of species, and have been proposed to act as dispersal corridors, roads can act as barriers to movement. This duality of roads and road verges has however rarely been assessed simultaneously, and it is unknown to what degree it depends on the amount of traffic on the road and on the habitat quality of the road verge. We used fluorescent powdered dye to track movements of flower-visiting insects along roads with varying traffic intensity, and in verges with contrasting habitat quality (flowering plant species richness and flower density). Insect movements along road verges were more frequent than movements into the adjacent habitats, indicating that verges act as corridors. The frequency of movements that required crossing the road was lower compared to the frequency of movements that did not, suggesting that roads are barriers. The movement patterns were independent of traffic intensity, but the barrier effect was stronger when the road verge had a higher density of flower resources. The effect of roads as a barrier and of the road verges as corridors were independent of each other. Our results suggest that flower-visiting insects tend to remain longer in road verges with high density of flowers and we therefore suggest that managing road verge habitats for an increased plant diversity will mitigate the known negative impacts of roads on insect populations.",10.1111/ecog.05847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05847,2022,4,road verges are corridors and roads barriers for the movement of flower‐visiting insects,10.1111/ecog.05847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05847

Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km(2), 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of ""two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes"" was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas.

In this study, we propose a modelling approach that combines species distribution models and data managed in geographic information systems to predict and quantify the effects of wind turbines and power lines on the breeding habitat of a soaring migratory bird, the black stork Ciconia nigra, in Italy. The species is recolonizing the country, where it had been driven to extinction in the Middle Age by human persecution. Today, infrastructures such as those considered in our study might in fact hamper this recolonization. Our results show a high probability of presence of the species in several areas in Italy. The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the future.

The brown bear, Ursus arctos, needs connectivity to supply the primary habitat requirements including food, water, shelter and space and to provide gene flow among all populations in the Iranian Caucasus. Aims In the present study, we investigated the status and habitat requirements of an endangered brown bear population within the Iranian Caucasus. Methods We applied an approach of consensus species distribution modelling to estimate the distribution of suitable habitats for brown bears using uncorrelated environmental variables. We then used the concept of circuit theory on resultant breeding patches to evaluate regional patterns of connectivity among these patches. Key results We predicted that ~9.10% of the study area is suitable for the brown bear at present. Ten patches (7.95% of the study area) were detected as suitable for breeding populations, where some populations are not able to survive without connectivity. The results indicated that habitat connectivity is sometimes widely affected by a high concentration of human activities such as roads, settlements and mining activities. Our findings showed that existing conservation areas could not safeguard the connectivity of brown bear habitats across the Iranian Caucasus. Conclusions Our results can help target fine-scaled planning approaches for the maintenance of bear meta-population structure, as well as facilitate the movement of individuals by protecting different landscape features. Implications The populations of brown bear are among the first to be harmed by the loss of habitat and connectivity, and, thus, this species is an appropriate focal species for linkage design that is beneficial for threatened populations of other co-existing species such as Persian leopard, grey wolf and Eurasian lynx.

However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions.

A technique to increase dispersal between otherwise isolated fragments is the use of corridors. Although previous studies have compared dispersal between connected fragments to dispersal between unconnected fragments, it remains unknown how dispersal between fragments connected by a corridor compares to dispersal in unfragmented landscapes. To assess the extent to which corridors can restore dispersal in fragmented landscapes to levels observed in unfragmented landscapes, we employed a stable-isotope marking technique to track seeds within four unfragmented landscapes and eight experimental landscapes with fragments connected by corridors. We studied two wind- and two bird-dispersed plant species, because previous community-based research showed that dispersal mode explains how connectivity effects vary among species. We constructed dispersal kernels for these species in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments by marking seeds in the center of each landscape with 'IN and then recovering marked seeds in seed traps at distances up to 200 m. For the two wind-dispersed plants, seed dispersal kernels were similar in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments. In contrast, dispersal kernels of bird-dispersed seeds were both affected by fragmentation and differed in the direction of the impact: Morella cerifera experienced more and Rhus copallina experienced less long-distance dispersal in unfragmented than in connected landscapes. These results show that corridors can facilitate dispersal probabilities comparable to those observed in unfragmented landscapes. Although dispersal mode may provide useful broad predictions, we acknowledge that similar species may respond uniquely due to factors such as seasonality and disperser behavior. Our results further indicate that prior work has likely underestimated dispersal distances of wind-dispersed plants and that factors altering long-distance dispersal may have a greater impact on the spread of species than previously thought.",10.1890/15-0734.1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0734.1,97,8,connectivity from a different perspective: comparing seed dispersal kernels in connected vs. unfragmented landscapes,10.1890/15-0734.1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0734.1

However, little attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators. Location Krakow area, Poland. Methods We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region of Krakow, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19 patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled. We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands using Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Results The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones.

We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC > 0.8). Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54 %) and planned (72 %) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale.

Aims: To explore and quantify the movements of birds from winter to breeding season locations across the urban-rural ecotone at the boundary of a large urban area. Methods: Birds were colour-ringed at rural and urban/suburban garden ringing sites during the winter. This was followed by breeding season surveys and resighting in the surrounding areas to quantify the movements of colour-ringed birds and changes in habitat selection between seasons. Results: Blue Tits and Great Tits ringed in winter in rural areas tended to move further and selected more urbanized breeding territories the following spring than did urban/suburban garden-ringed conspecifics. This shows that the populations were connected across the urban-rural ecotone by the seasonal movements of individuals, but that net movement was from rural wintering areas to urban breeding habitat. Conclusion: The results suggest that rural populations may not be subsidized by urban wintering birds and winter supplementary feeding, but that the resources in gardens within urban areas, perhaps spring/summer feeding and nestboxes, draw birds in to breed. Combined with independent evidence for lower breeding success in urban areas, this may show the operation of source-sink dynamics.

In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous flora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical (>50%) in the spontaneous flora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment.

Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network. Methods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis. Results. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic. The characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen. Scientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined. Practical importance.

Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multilevel, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature.

Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds. Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield. Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK. Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover. Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites.

In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or fields in a landscape. We took a finite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, USA. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized finite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape.

Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 x 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis.

Urban ecological infrastructure is a network system of natural lands and waters that provides ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to design landscape corridors that maximize the value of ecosystem services in ecological infrastructure planning. We explored the optimal corridors to enhance the connectivity among landscape elements to design an ecological infrastructure for the city of Gwacheon, South Korea, as an example of a small urban area. We calculated the value of ecosystem services using standardized estimation indices based on an intensive review of the relevant literature and employed the least-cost path method to optimize the connectivity of landscape structural elements. The land use type in the city with the highest estimated value of ecosystem services was the riparian zone (i.e., 2011 US$7,312.16/ha). Given areal coverage of all land use types, the estimated value of developed area open spaces was 2011 US$899,803.25, corresponding to the highest contribution to the total value of ecosystem services.

A case study using amphibians,Landscape and Urban Planning,"wos, scopus, pastsearch",409,"Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency.

The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios.

We assessed the effects of landscape, sex and population management (reintroduction and translocations) on gene flow of Leontopithecus rosalia, an endangered arboreal primate living in highly fragmented forests of Brazil. We genotyped 201 individuals using 14 microsatellite loci to answer three questions: (1) How far does L. rosalia disperse? (2) Is dispersal sex-biased? (3) What are the relative contributions of population management, distance, roads and landscape resistance to genetic kinship? We hypothesized that (1) gene flow decrease between more distant sites; (2) males disperse more than females; and (3) management and land-cover resistance (i.e. landscape resistance) are the variables that most influence genetic kinship. We found positive spatial population-structure up to 8 km. The spatial structure was similar between females and males suggesting that they equally contribute to gene flow. Management and landscape resistance best explained genetic kinship, showing that different land-cover types affect the dispersal at different degrees of landscape permeability. We advocate that maintaining more permeable landscapes is essential to ensure dispersal and gene flow of arboreal mammals.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel viewpoint and method to identify, analyze and optimize the ecological network of Wuyishan City. The bidirectional least-cost distance model is applied to identify the landscape network in Wuyishan City for the year 1995 and 2005, which can incorportate digraph in ecological network modeling, overcome the limitation of failing to reflect the orientation of the species' dispersal process, and make the process of modeling more convincing by distinguishing flux orientation of ""go"" and ""return"" of two random patches. Three new metrics, i.e., network cyclicity, degree of cyclicity, and degree of connectedness, which can quantify the integrity and continuity of network and the relation between network organization and ecological process, are introduced to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and reflect the network's ability to transfer bio-flux. The results show that the ecological network of Wuyishan City in the year 1995 and 2005 have respectively a network size of 18 and 17, degree of connectedness of 1 and 0.7647, network cyclicity of 7.1378 and 8.2570, and degree of cyclicity of 0.3965 and 0.4857, which indicate that the network in Wuyishan City for the year 2005 has strong ability to transfer bio-flux, a high level of eco-process diversity, and a low level of integrity and continuity. It can be concluded that during the past 10 years, different areas of Wuyishan City have gone through landscape degradation and restoration. In the northeast, network components degraded severely and made several patches ""isolated islands"", while in the southwest, the network has been developed because of landscape restoration. In particular, the linkages among the patches of natural reserve and its neighborhood increased remarkably, which directly increased the interaction strength and the whole network cyclicity. Then, via scenario analysis, we also identify the patches and linkages that make great contributions to the entire cyclicity and connectedness, such as patches [1,2,3,4,5,6] (Nature reserve and its neighborhood), [12] (bridging the north and west part) and [19] (bridging the south and west part), and linkages among the central patches.

This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges.

So far, airborne laser scanning system (ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.",10.3390/rs10091403,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053607874&doi=10.3390%2frs10091403&partnerID=40&md5=dfabf2435a07fb576fdc6e319fc85da1,10,3,mapping individual tree species and vitality along urban road corridors with lidar and imaging sensors: point density versus view perspective,10.3390/rs10091403,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing10.html#WuYP18; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RemS...10.1403W/abstract; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/9/1403/pdf; https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/mapping-individual-tree-species-and-vitality-along-urban-road-cor; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/9/1403

Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be,100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings. Methodology and Principal Findings: We examined the effect of a major highway on dispersal patterns over a 2 year period. A. aegypti larvae were collected on the east and west sides of Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) to examine any effect UBH may have on the observed population structure in the Charlieville neighborhood in Trinidad, West Indies. A panel of nine microsatellites, two SNPs and a 710 bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) were used for the molecular analyses of the samples. Three CO1 haplotypes were identified, one of which was only found on the east side of the road in 2006 and 2007.

Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models.

However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species. To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland. We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of oak processionary moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of 'effective distance' from the source (i.e. the patch 'voltage' in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012. We showed that 'effective distance' fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their 'current' and 'power' (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM. Patches identified as 'important' are potential 'pinch points' and regions of high 'flow', where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection.

Fragmentation and isolation can be reversed by restoring landscape connectivity through effective Ecological Network (EN) planning. However, most of the studies analyzing the influence of connectivity and landscape structure on biodiversity are focused on animals, while the understanding of their interplaying role on plant diversity remains limited. .We studied the relationships between alpha and 13 diversity pattern and landscape structure and connectivity in the nodes of an EN developed in agricultural landscapes, as a part of regional landscape planning framework in Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy). As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes).A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (alpha-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low 13-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors alpha plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130563290&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115358&partnerID=40&md5=36636a9dbd6d43bb08801cb07715c6a4,317,4,"connectivity, landscape structure, and plant diversity across agricultural landscapes: novel insight into effective ecological network planning",10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130563290&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115358&partnerID=40&md5=36636a9dbd6d43bb08801cb07715c6a4

Whether and how much associations between species are also changing is much less documented. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition. We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of species turnover (beta-diversity) and community generalism (community generalisation index). The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements. We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in species turnover and community generalism in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower spatial species turnover and higher community generalism, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations and may also have an impact on species interactions. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes. Although species associations contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.",10.1111/oik.08756,NA,2022,8,biotic homogenisation in bird communities leads to large-scale changes in species associations,10.1111/oik.08756,NA

Here, I provide a high spatial resolution snapshot of the green cover distribution of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by incorporating the use of morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) as a tool to describe the spatial pattern and connectivity of the city's urban green areas. Analysis of a previously developed IKONOS 4-m spatial resolution classification of the city of San Juan from 2002 revealed a larger area of vegetation (green areas or green infrastructure) than previously estimated by moderate spatial resolution imagery. The city as a whole had approximately 42% green cover and 55% impervious surfaces. Although the city appeared greener in its southern upland sector compared to the northern coastal section, where most built-up urban areas occurred (66% impervious surfaces), northern San Juan had 677 ha more green area cover dispersed across the city than the southern component. MSPA revealed that most forest cover occurred as edges and cores, and green areas were most commonly forest cores, with larger predominance in the southern sector of the municipality. In dense, built-up, urban land, most of the green areas occurred in private yards as islets. When compared to other cities across the United States, San Juan was most similar in green cover features to Boston, Massachusetts, and Miami, Florida. Per capita green space for San Juan (122.2 m(2)/inhabitant) was also comparable to these two U. S. cities. This study explores the intra-urban vegetation variation in the city of San Juan, which is generally overlooked by moderate spatial resolution classifications in Puerto Rico. It serves as a starting point for green infrastructure mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the urban green spaces within the city of San Juan.

With thousands of years of agriculture-dominated historical urbanization followed by 40 years of intensive and rapid urbanization, Shanghai provides an ideal environment to study how the two-stage urbanization process influences the evolution of indigenous wildlife, especially of anuran species. Therefore, in this study, we used mitochondrial Cyt-b gene, microsatellite (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to evaluate the demographic history and genetic structure of the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi), by sampling 407 individuals from 15 local populations across Shanghai, China. All local populations experienced bottlenecks during historical urbanization, while the local populations in urban areas maintained comparable contemporary effective population sizes (N-e) and genetic diversity with suburban and rural populations. Nevertheless, the rapid modern urbanization has already imposed significant negative effects to the integrity of populations. The 15 local populations were differentiated into eight genetic clusters, showing a spatial distribution pattern consistent with the current urbanization gradient and island-mainland geography. Although moderate gene flow still occurred from the rural peripheral cluster to urban and suburban clusters, population fragmentation was more serious in the urban and suburban populations, where higher urbanization levels within 2-km radius areas showed significant negative relationships to the N-e and genetic diversity of local populations. Therefore, to protect urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability, improving conditions in fragmented habitat remnants might be most essential for local populations living in more urbanized areas.

Constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability. This paper selected Denko County of Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia, which is located in the desert oasis area, as the study area. Ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment, and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources, and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest-grass ecological network (FG eco-network) of the study area. This paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the FG ecological network. Moreover, the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the FG eco-network in 11 development scenarios. The results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario; the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness, PageRank, etc. have gradually decreased. The study found that the network density increases slightly in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development. Moreover, in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert, the FG eco-network within the sample circle expanded. This represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area. Under the existing natural conditions, the study area still has room for economic development, but space is limited.

The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region.

From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small.

We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments.

Temperature emerged as the main driver of wild bee communities, with communities richer in species and individuals at warmer temperatures. We found little species replacement between cold and warm sites. In addition, with increasing temperatures, bee communities were dominated by polylectic and small-bodied species.

Typically, these habitats contain less than half of the native woodland bird species that would exist at these sites if they were not developed. They also contain more total bird species than if these sites were left in a natural state. This apparent contradiction raises the question of ""How do suburban habitats function in the urban-rural habitat network?"" In this study, we analyze bird distributions on three rural-to-urban gradients in different ecoregions of the United States: Oxford, Ohio; Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. All three gradients exhibit similar patterns of extinction of native species followed by invasion of common species and subsequent biotic homogenization with urbanization. This patterning suggests that suburban land uses, those represented by the intermediate levels of development on the gradients, are a point of extirpation for woodland birds as well as an entry point for invasive species into urban systems. Furthermore, there are consistent patterns in the functional characteristics of the bird communities that also shift with intensifying urbanization, providing insight on the possible mechanisms of homogenization and community structure in urban ecosystems including an increase in the number of broods per year, a shift in nesting strategies, a decrease in insectivorous individuals, an increase in granivorous individuals, and a decrease in territoriality. Consequently, it appears that there are specific traits that drive the shift in community composition in response to urban and suburban land use. These results have significant implications for improving understanding of the mechanisms of suburban community ecology and conserving birds in urban habitat networks.",10.1007/s10980-008-9267-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57849087687&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-008-9267-y&partnerID=40&md5=7b178e2fa9277c7be744971a3e16ed83,23,2,suburban habitats and their role for birds in the urban-rural habitat network: points of local invasion and extinction?,10.1007/s10980-008-9267-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9267-y/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9267-y; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093012950; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093012950.html; https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/suburban-habitats-and-their-role-for-birds-in-the-urban-rural-hab

Here, we evaluated how urbanization affects plant-hummingbird interactions at two spatial scales. First, in a medium-sized city from southeastern Brazil ( > 600,000 inhabitants), we contrasted interaction networks from urban and natural areas, and used artificial nectar feeder stations to evaluate changes in the composition of hummingbird assemblages across an urbanization gradient. Second, we compiled data on six urban plant-hummingbird interaction networks from south and southeastern Brazil to identify the characteristics associated with the most important plants. Locally, urbanization affected hummingbird communities by promoting higher generalization and dominance by more aggressive hummingbirds. Notably, specialized long-billed hermits were absent both in the urban interaction network and at feeder stations from more urbanized areas. Across networks, trees were more important for hummingbirds than shrubs/herbs as were specialized ornithophilous flowers in relation to non-ornithophilous flowers. Plant origin (native or exotic) did not matter. Our results indicate that urban plant-hummingbird communities are organized differently than their counterparts from natural areas, which usually feature key hermits and few trees.

However, the effectiveness of urban corridors on birds remains equivocal because vegetation corridor is often managed for human use with little consideration of wildlife. Here we compared the effects of three major corridors of varying vegetation structures (trees with a dense understory, trees with a sparse understory, and grassy areas with sparse trees) on the species richness and abundance of birds in 21 wooded patches in the center of Tokyo, Japan, during wintering and breeding seasons. Using generalized linear models and Akaike's information criterion, we found that the effectiveness of corridors depended on the tolerance of birds to urbanization. Urban avoider species, having low tolerance to urbanization, demonstrated lower species richness and abundance in patches close to the corridor with a sparsely vegetated understory as compared with patches close to the understory-richer corridors during winter, although such an effect disappeared during the breeding season. The corridors did not have a significant effect on suburban adapter species with a high tolerance to urbanization.

While this disturbance causes most species to be in local decline, some show specific behavioural plasticity, facilitating success in a new habitat. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a common small mammal species which occurs in high numbers in urban environments. To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals' space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels' success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species' potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals' foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.",10.4404/hystrix-00065-2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067404016&doi=10.4404%2fhystrix-00065-2018&partnerID=40&md5=44f177378fb87c6e4bf80b8dfe28ff5a,29,5,degree of urbanisation affects eurasian red squirrel activity patterns,10.4404/hystrix-00065-2018,http://www.italian-journal-of-mammalogy.it/pdf-92168-34984?filename=Degree of urbanisation.pdf

Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events.

We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km(2) area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes.

However, this practice is often limited by incomplete information on the study species requirements and insufficient efforts to adopt robust inference modeling approaches. We developed occurrence and breeding habitat models for the European brown bear Ursus arctos in the Northern range of the poorly-known Carpathian population, focusing on the evaluation of a restricted set of hypotheses based on prevailing insights on the species constrains. Hypotheses were confronted using a dataset of 3151 bear observations in Poland for the period 1985-2005. Forest availability was the most important limiting factor, whereas anthropic factors (human density and urban areas) separated between suitable and non-suitable forest-rich areas. Forest composition contributed poorly to predict bear occurrence but was important to differentiate between breeding and non-breeding habitats: breeding females required a larger amount of forest cover, lower human influence and the interspersion of grassland/shrubland patches. Model transfer to the western Carpathian population in Slovakia supported the accuracy of habitat predictions and the robustness of the approach. Results highlight the need to control unplanned urban sprawl to preserve the species habitat and the connectivity between the Western and Eastern segments of the Carpathian population. Predicted but unoccupied habitats in other regions also require consideration, particularly some favorable areas of confluence with other large carnivore habitats.

Establishing and implementing the ecological function of urban green structures and conservation plans for urban terrestrial species requires prioritizing developing an understanding of the community structure of urban terrestrial species. However, understanding the appearance and distribution of terrestrial species in urban ecosystems is often neglected or lacking; furthermore, the inaccurate detection of species distribution can create biased estimates of species occupancy. Recently, an applied research method for detecting terrestrial species such as mammals and birds has been proposed based on molecular biology such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We installed artificial water tanks (mesocosm) in urban green spaces (Urban forests; UFs, Urban ecological corridors; UECs, Urban parks; UPs), applying eDNA metabarcoding as a tool to detect wild terrestrial species, and camera traps (CTs) and field surveys were performed in parallel to verify the results. We detected 22 urban terrestrial species only by eDNA metabarcoding and identified 43 species in total by performing eDNA metabarcoding, CTs, and field surveys in parallel. In addition, we identified 31 species of UFs, 13 species of UECs, and 28 species of UPs of urban terrestrial species using the three species survey methods in parallel. We confirmed that eDNA meta-barcoding is very useful for detecting small species that are difficult to detect with the naked eye and internal species vulnerable to disturbance. However, since some species were only detected by CTs or field surveys due to DNA false-negative errors or the species' life-history characteristics, it was judged that the species inventory can be effectively collected using several monitoring techniques.",10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127782,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141294729&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2022.127782&partnerID=40&md5=1d47c39a90f26c8371c6b6cb3e7c051f,78,3,environmental dna metabarcoding effectively monitors terrestrial species by using urban green spaces,10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127782,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141294729&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2022.127782&partnerID=40&md5=1d47c39a90f26c8371c6b6cb3e7c051f

I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban-rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia.

There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site.

This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them.

The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.",10.1016/0169-2046(94)02020-G,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58149209087&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2894%2902020-G&partnerID=40&md5=7d8a793c2f051f412cde58b1128032c9,33,2,a landscape ecological model for wildlife enhancement of stormwater management-practices in urban greenways,10.1016/0169-2046(94)02020-G,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58149209087&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2894%2902020-G&partnerID=40&md5=7d8a793c2f051f412cde58b1128032c9

This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. Objectives To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Methods Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. Results The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Conclusions Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns.

Effective hedgehog conservation requires an understanding of the hedgehog's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Due to globally increasing urbanisation, the use of artificial light sources to illuminate the night, called light pollution, has spread dramatically. Light pollution significantly affects the behaviour and ecology of wildlife, but the hedgehog's behaviour towards light pollution remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of light pollution on the natural movement behaviour of hedgehogs living in an urban environment. Although hedgehogs can react very variably to environmental influences, the majority of hedgehogs studied here preferred to move in less illuminated rather than in strongly illuminated areas. This apparently rigid behaviour could be used in applied hedgehog conservation to connect isolated hedgehog populations or to safely guide the animals around places dangerous for them via dark corridors that are attractive for hedgehogs. With urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual's home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs' habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal's sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation.",10.3390/ani10081306,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459628; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306; https://core.ac.uk/download/340075712.pdf,10,4,moving in the dark-evidence for an influence of artificial light at night on the movement behaviour of european hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus),10.3390/ani10081306,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459628; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306; https://core.ac.uk/download/340075712.pdf

The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas.

We performed the analysis using multiple orders of zeta, which provides insight on the role played by rare and common species in determining levels of dissimilarity. We also ran the analyses using the community of native Passeriformes as a phylogenetically close contrasting control. Our results showed that the proportion of urban area, a variable related to colonization and propagule pressure, had a strong influence on Psittaciformes but not on alien Passeriformes. This latter group showed to be primarily influenced by environmental factors, similarly to what was found for native Passeriformes. On other hand, human connectivity, as measured by distance through roads and railways seemed to play a significant role in shaping the compositional dissimilarity of alien Passeriformes, but not Psittaciformes. Regardless of the group analysed, the relative importance of the explanatory variables was similar for both rare and common species. Our findings highlight differences between the factors driving compositional dissimilarity for distinct groups of birds.

Ensuring the delivery of these benefits requires an understanding of current and potential future forest conditions, yet urban forest dynamics are not well-understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining forest structure and composition in 126 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes (large [95-126 ha], medium [1-19 ha], and small [0.05-0.65 ha] patches) in the city of New Haven, CT. We detected significant shifts in forest structure and composition suggesting a suite of distinct successional trajectories within each patch size. Large patches comprised 95% native tree species in the canopy (>5 cm dbh), sapling (1-5 cm dbh), and seedling (<1 cm dbh) layers, suggesting that these large patches will continue to be native-dominated in the future-a primary objective for urban forest management. Moreover, in these large patches, shifts in the dominant species in each stratum suggest that as large patches move through succession they will transition from moderately shade-tolerant forest types (i.e., oaks) to shade-tolerant types (i.e., American beech)-a similar successional trajectory to surrounding second-growth forests in the region. Medium patches were the most heterogeneous patch size sampled. Despite this heterogeneity, they generally resembled large patches in the canopy and sapling layers but diverged in the seedling layer. In medium patches, the invasive Norway maple replaced American beech as primary seedling species suggesting a future shift toward non-native-dominated forest in the future. Small patches were the most compositionally and structurally distinct patch size sampled. Only 36% of the canopy trees and saplings in small patches were native species; however, this increased to 71% native in the seedling layer. Additionally, the most important seedling species included those that are bird-dispersed highlighting the potentially valuable role that these small, non-native, forest fragments play as wildlife corridors. Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple forest types, dynamics, and conditions can be found within a single city and that forest patch size offers a helpful framework to begin to parse out these differences.",10.1002/ecs2.4001,NA,13,6,diverging conditions of current and potential future urban forest patches,10.1002/ecs2.4001,NA

We asked, does the composition of the landscape surrounding a riparian survey point influence plant species distribution, community composition, or habitat structure? We expected, for example, that invasive non-native species might be more abundant as the amount of surrounding urbanization increased. We surveyed 137 points in riparian vegetation in Orange County, California, along an urbanization gradient. Using logistic regression we analyzed 79 individual plant species' distributions, finding 20 negatively associated and 12 positively associated with the amount of development within a 1-km radius around the survey points, even after accounting for the effects of elevation. However, after summarizing plant community composition with Detrended Correspondence Analysis we observed that, overall, community composition was not statistically correlated with the amount of development surrounding a survey point once the association between development and elevation was taken into account. Non-native species were not particularly associated with increasing development, but instead were distributed throughout vegetation and urbanization gradients. However, the extent of the tree and herb layers (structural attributes) was associated with development, with the tree layer increasing and the herb layer decreasing as urbanization increased. Thus, although the degree of surrounding urbanization appears to influence the distribution of a number of individual plant species, overall composition of the community in our study system seemed relatively unaffected. Instead, we suggest that community composition reflected larger-scale environmental conditions, such as stream order and other variables associated with elevation, and/or regional-scale disturbances, such as historic grazing or enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen.",10.1007/s10980-008-9210-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149131433&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-008-9210-2&partnerID=40&md5=a364b58737e0d3716e5ae0d159d1806a,23,2,"riparian plant composition in an urbanizing landscape in southern california, usa",10.1007/s10980-008-9210-2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9210-2; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-008-9210-2/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-008-9210-2.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20083114763.html; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083114763; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/463893

Land use projections are rarely used due to their unavailability and, when available, are often at coarse spatial and thematic resolutions, making them unsuitable to capture fine scale habitat suitability. This study aims to (a) show how coupled land use change (LUC) models of high thematic resolution (HTR) can be used in species distribution models (SDM), (b) compare the impacts of HTR and low thematic resolution (LTR) explanatory predictors on biodiversity scenarios and (c) assess the impact of species' present area of occupancy on the effect of thematic resolution in SDMs. Location Belgium Taxon Bumblebees (Bombus) Methods We compared species distribution models with 17 land use predictors (HTR) against models with 5 land use predictors (LTR). We modelled the distribution of 17 bumblebee species in Belgium projected until 2035. We examined how model performance, variable importance and projections of distribution change differed depending on the thematic resolution of the land use predictors. Results Overall, HTR models performed better than LTR models. LTR models predicted greater extent per species. HTR projected a greater percentage of range gains, and both models projected similar losses of suitable habitat. However, the percentage loss and connectivity of suitable habitats varied differently for HTR and LTR models along a gradient of rare to common species. The HTR models projected greater loss of suitable areas for rare species and less loss for common species compared to LTR models. Main conclusions These results illustrate the importance of using ecologically relevant explanatory variables in SDMs, particularly for rare and localized species with specific habitat requirements.

While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas.

Current efforts within urban landscapes aim to support biodiversity and diverse ecosystem services such as storm water management, sustainable food production, and toxin remediation. Arthropod natural enemies provide biocontrol services important for the ecosystem management of urban greenspaces. Establishing habitat for these and other beneficial arthropods is a growing area of urban conservation. Habitat design, resource inputs, management, and abiotic conditions shape the value of greenspace habitats for arthropods. In general, larger patches with diverse plant communities support a greater abundance and diversity of natural enemies and biocontrol services, yet opposing patterns or no effects have also been documented. The surrounding landscape is likely a contributor to this variation in natural enemy response to patch-scale habitat design and management. Looking across rural-urban landscape gradients, natural enemy communities shift toward dominance by habitat generalists and disturbance tolerant species in urban areas compared to rural or natural communities. These changes have been linked to variation in habitat fragmentation, plant productivity and management intensity. In landscape-scale studies focusing solely within cities, variables such as impervious surface area and greenspace connectivity affect the community assembly of natural enemies within a patch. Given these findings, a greater mechanistic understanding of how both the composition and spatial context of urban greenspaces influence natural enemy biodiversity-biocontrol relationships is needed to advance conservation planning and implementation.

The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts.MethodsFifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m(2) plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales.ResultsCanopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests.ConclusionsCanopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs.",10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059134834&doi=10.1186%2fs40490-018-0124-8&partnerID=40&md5=d4d28b85af06ee7dd61a75ff23ef949c,48,3,"invasive alien plant species, fragmentation and scale effects on urban forest community composition in durban, south africa",10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193189491; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8.pdf; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6268006; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8; https://nzjforestryscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8

In this paper, we analyse and compare the morphologies and sustainability potential of residential suburbs and their gardens in two case studies: Traditional-suburban and Modern-suburban in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Spatial distributions of land-cover patterns were estimated using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). The four sustainability parameters measured were: roof rain water collection; local food (vegetable) production; energy and CO2 emission savings from clothes lines; and carbon benefits of onsite tree canopy cover. Outcomes suggest that land cover such as tree canopy cover and other permeable and impermeable surfaces in garden spaces can significantly impact on sustainability. Impermeable surface cover is higher in the Modern-suburban compared to the Traditional-suburban development. Traditional-suburban is more capable of supporting environmental and ecological functions through better connectivity of green spaces and availability of onsite land areas for local food production. Modern-suburban has more capacity for roof rainwater collection due to larger building roof sizes, provided there is planning for sufficient tank spaces in the design phases. These results identify specific characteristics of two suburban forms which could make positive contributions to suburban sustainability.

Urban densification aims to counteract urban sprawl; however, it threatens urban green spaces that act as sustainable alternative habitats for wildlife. In this study, we used the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) as a model species to develop sustainable planning recommendations for urban green spaces. Using species distribution models (SDMs) in combinations with high-resolution predicting variables (2 x 2 m grid cell), we defined the suitable habitat of a Common Redstart territory in a moderately urbanized environment. We then predicted how the distribution would be affected under realistic scenarios of land-use modification (termed conservation scenario and threat scenario) in an effort to provide recommendations for urban green space planning. Tree canopy cover was the principal land-cover type in the SDMs that explained the current species distribution followed by impervious surface and short-cut lawn.

Wildlife show tremendous variation in their responses to urbanization; even within a single population, some individuals can specialize on urban or natural habitat types. This specialization could alter pathogen impacts on host populations via changes to wildlife movement and aggregation. Here, we build a mechanistic model to explore how habitat specialization in urban landscapes affects interactions between a mobile host population and a density-dependent specialist pathogen that confers no immunity. We model movement on a network of resource-stable urban sites and resource-fluctuating natural sites, where hosts are urban specialists, natural specialists, or generalists that use both patch types. We find that for generalists, natural and partially urban landscapes produce the highest infection prevalence and mortality, driven by high movement rates at natural sites and high densities at urban sites. However, habitat specialization protects hosts from these negative effects of partially urban landscapes by limiting movement between patch types. These findings suggest that habitat specialization can benefit populations by reducing infectious disease transmission, but by reducing movement between habitat types it could also carry the cost of reducing other movement-related ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and pollination.",10.1086/717655,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717655,199,3,habitat specialization by wildlife reduces pathogen spread in urbanizing landscapes,10.1086/717655,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717655

These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought.

Here, we analyze the effects of landscape contemporary changes and dynamics in paleodistribution during the Quaternary on genetic diversity and differentiation in the Pallas' long-tongued bat, Glossophaga soricina. We sampled 18 populations in landscapes with different land cover, and used nine microsatellite loci and the sequence of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (CYB) to obtain genetic data. We performed ecological niche modelling and used general linear mixed models and optimization of multiple resistance surfaces to analyze how landscape structure and climatic suitability affect genetic diversity and differentiation. Our results show that the conversion of natural vegetation, such as forests and savannas, to agriculture, pastures or urban matrices (unsuitable habitats) decreases genetic diversity and increases inbreeding, but has no effect on genetic differentiation among populations, that was likely affected by spatial distance. Our findings point to the importance of maintenance of large areas of natural vegetation remnants to conserve genetic diversity of G. soricina, an important bat pollinator in the Neotropics.

Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

While high resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density - 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m(2), aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery - 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7 -11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2-8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area.

We forecast the ecological condition of a modeled conservation network of cores and habitat linkages in the San Joaquin Valley, California, a highly developed agricultural area. We assessed current and projected future impacts from modeled urban growth representing seven regional urban growth policy scenarios to determine conservation and restoration priorities. We characterized current ecological condition of the linkages using a clustering algorithm that compared vegetation type, length, and major road and canal crossings. The modeled urban growth forecasts were overlaid on the ecological network to identify expected impacts. A threat index was calculated for individual network components and for component clusters, and revealed significant impact differences between the various urban growth scenarios.

Consequently, their impacts on nature and landscape have to be compensated by no net loss policies in many countries around the world. However, their practical implementation often poses challenges with regard to the optimal spatial coordination and assessment of measures, especially in the case of eco-accounts or other habitat banking approaches.Against this backdrop, different approaches to offset biodiversity loss at regional level are analysed with due consideration of indicators of economy, ecology, landscape aesthetics and food production. We used an interdisciplinary modelling approach based on estimates for offsetting demand until 2030. In the integrated land use model, we associated a biophysical crop growth model with an economic optimisation model. The Stuttgart Region - an area with stiff competition amongst anthropogenic land use patterns in Germany - served as the study area. Our main focus was on arable land that has a high potential for nature conservation enhancement. In this context, farmers are deemed to be a major stakeholder group.We observed differing economic and ecological outcomes for the offsetting scenarios we considered. In urban areas with high population density and low biodiversity (e.g. Stuttgart city), compensation close to the site of intervention (on-site) may be more expensive than off-site compensation. However, further added value can be generated by on-site compensation in terms of visual landscape quality enhancement and habitat connectivity, provided that the measures lend themselves to establishing connectivity. Consequently, spatially unrestricted markets for eco credits may exacerbate ecological polarisation between urban and rural areas. Therefore, we concluded that offset site selection should not be driven solely by economics, as this may not optimise overall welfare from a societal perspective, resulting in the need for legal constraints.Our results show the trade-offs between the political goals of spatial planning approaches and compensation strategies.

Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard, Podarcis rnuralis, are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only.

Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River.

We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity.

These processes cause changes in natural landscapes by decreasing area, connectivity, and fragment size, and increasing edge effects and number of fragments. Understanding which and how many species persist in disturbed fragments may indicate the species' minimum requirements and might contribute to their conservation. Here we show how the mammalian fauna of medium and large size (higher than 1 kg) are structured in a semideciduous seasonal forest fragment of 36.5 ha in the urban area of Jatai, Goias. We performed the sampling with 30 sand track plots (1 x 1 m). We analyzed the relative record frequency and built a collector's curve to demonstrate the sampling effort. With a total effort of 600 track plots x days, we recorded twelve species of mammals with our tracks sampling method, from which only the wild mammals were included in the analyzes (11 species). The estimated species richness reached 13 species (SD (Standard Deviation) = +/- 1, CI (Confidence Interval) = +/- 2 (11 - 15 species). The species with the highest relative record frequency was Didelphis albiventris and the species with the lowest was Tamandua tetradactyla. The fragment size must be a limiting factor to the richness and to the occurrence of species, as it may not be sufficient to allow the persistence of a population or an individual. Disturbances that originated from houses, like domestic animals and movement of people, also contributed to the removal and extinction of species. To conserve the species in the fragment, we suggest the prevention of entrance of people and of domestic animals. We also recommend increased connectivity of the fragment with the landscape external to the urban area in order to allow the movement of the currently present species.",10.1590/S1676-06032013000200008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882253279&doi=10.1590%2fS1676-06032013000200008&partnerID=40&md5=fcdf6ffdf8db36a11d8e1675ef8ad147,13,2,assemblage of medium and large size mammals in an urban semideciduous seasonal forest fragment in cerrado biome,10.1590/S1676-06032013000200008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882253279&doi=10.1590%2fS1676-06032013000200008&partnerID=40&md5=fcdf6ffdf8db36a11d8e1675ef8ad147

Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e. g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e. g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity.

Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated.

Seasonal difference in the crossing probability was found only for Varied Tit, and the probability was the highest in the breeding season.

Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence. 2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species. 3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack. 4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leafminer abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements. 5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants.

Effective management strategies for urban woodland require an understanding of the ecology and habitat requirements of all relevant taxa. Yet, little is known of how invertebrate, and in particular moth, assemblages utilise urban woodland despite being commonly found within the urban landscape. Here we show that the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages found within urban woodlands are determined by woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and the surrounding landscape. In general, mature broadleaved woodlands supported the highest abundance and diversity of moths. Large compact woodlands with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix were associated with higher moth abundance than small complex woodlands. Woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscape, suggesting that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be relatively more important for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix.

Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species. The metapopulation approach provides a valuable tool for understanding how colonization and extinction shape occupancy patterns in highly fragmented plant populations.

We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PA interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets.",10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01783,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421003334; https://kyushu-u.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/area-based-conservation-planning-in-japan-the-importance-of-oecms,30,3,area-based conservation planning in japan: the importance of oecms in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01783,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421003334; https://kyushu-u.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/area-based-conservation-planning-in-japan-the-importance-of-oecms

In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.",10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059859030&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-019-0825-7&partnerID=40&md5=d4201059e80a3e7e9ea18e26ab9875c3,22,3,short-distance pollen dispersal by bats in an urban setting: monitoring the movement of a vertebrate pollinator through fluorescent dyes,10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6337663; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193274834; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7

This process has many impacts on the ecological function and structure of the landscape. In this article, we analyze the effects of urban sprawl on the ecological patterns and processes in the Montreal Metropolitan Region (MMR) between 1966 and 2010. The dispersed sprawl of low-density urban areas within the territory during this period sharply increased the fragmentation of the territory, isolating the few remaining natural spaces and decreasing their ecological connectivity and, ultimately, biodiversity. The results obtained clearly show that land-use changes that occurred in the MMR have caused profound changes in landscape properties, both structurally and functionally, and especially from 1981 to 2010. In 1966, around 45% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38% in 1981.

We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads.

Secondly, a high value area with ecological continuity related to the river greenway is planned along the river greenway. Thirdly, a sufficient natural area is needed to give the area a river corridor influence, maintain the river's ecological continuity, and keep this natural area undisturbed by zoning.

Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal.

The metrics used in this study were landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch distance and patch context. These indices were simple to use and required land cover data that were recorded from aerial photography and a digital topographic map. The metrics indicated the highest species richness, highest potential for species dispersal and highest ecological stability for the mountain landscape, followed by the urban fringe, agricultural land and the urban area.

Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are felids capable of living in urban environments, but are sensitive to habitat fragmentation and, thus, useful indicators of landscape connectivity; in particular, bobcat habitat selection, movement, and mortality may be affected by roads. We analyzed movement patterns of 52 bobcats in southern California in three study sites and investigated: (1) how bobcats responded to two types of roads within their home ranges; (2) how they placed their home ranges with respect to roads within the study area; and (3) whether male and female bobcats differed in their behavioral responses to roads. Within home ranges, primary and secondary roads did not influence movements, but bobcats more frequently crossed secondary roads when road densities were higher within their home ranges, thus increasing mortality risk. However, road densities within each study site were several times higher than road densities within home ranges, suggesting bobcats selected against roaded areas in home-range placement. Male home ranges bordering roads were smaller than home ranges for other males, but male home ranges containing roads were larger than those without roads. Male bobcats also were more likely to cross roads than females, potentially reflecting larger male home range sizes. Our results suggest roads have important impacts on urban bobcats, with stronger effects on males than females, and continued efforts to mitigate the effects of roads on carnivores and other fragmentation-sensitive species would help promote connectivity conservation in urban systems.

Thus, timely monitoring and quantitative analysis of the changes in land use over time and identification of landscape pattern variation related to growth modes in different periods are essential. This study aimed to inspect spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape pattern responses to land use changes in Xuzhou, China durfing the period of 1985-2015. In this context, we propose a new spectral index, called the Normalized Difference Enhanced Urban Index (NDEUI), which combines Nighttime light from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System with annual maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index to reduce the detection confusion between urban areas and barren land. The NDEUI-assisted random forests algorithm was implemented to obtain the land use/land cover maps of Xuzhou in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively. Four different periods (1985-1995, 1995-2005, 2005-2015, and 1985-2015) were chosen for the change analysis of land use and landscape patterns. The results indicate that the urban area has increased by about 30.65%, 10.54%, 68.77%, and 143.75% during the four periods at the main expense of agricultural land, respectively. The spatial trend maps revealed that continuous transition from other land use types into urban land has occurred in a dual-core development mode throughout the urbanization process. We quantified the patch complexity, aggregation, connectivity, and diversity of the landscape, employing a number of landscape metrics to represent the changes in landscape patterns at both the class and landscape levels. The results show that with respect to the four aspects of landscape patterns, there were considerable differences among the four years, mainly owing to the increasing dominance of urbanized land. Spatiotemporal variation in landscape patterns was examined based on 900 x 900 m sub-grids. Combined with the land use changes and spatiotemporal variations in landscape patterns, urban growth mainly occurred in a leapfrog mode along both sides of the roads during the period of 1985 to 1995, and then shifted into edge-expansion mode during the period of 1995 to 2005, and the edge-expansion and leapfrog modes coexisted in the period from 2005 to 2015. The high value spatiotemporal information generated using remote sensing and geographic information system in this study could assist urban planners and policymakers to better understand urban dynamics and evaluate their spatiotemporal and environmental impacts at the local level to enable sustainable urban planning in the future.",10.3390/su10114287,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056794599&doi=10.3390%2fsu10114287&partnerID=40&md5=b17f85b717f86c33a7d549601651d6bb,10,3,"spatio-temporal variation analysis of landscape pattern response to land use change from 1985 to 2015 in xuzhou city, china",10.3390/su10114287,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056794599&doi=10.3390%2fsu10114287&partnerID=40&md5=b17f85b717f86c33a7d549601651d6bb

As a consequence, lower landscape connectivity is expected to enhance extinction risks through a decrease in gene flow and the resulting negative effects of genetic drift, accumulation of deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression. Such phenomena are particularly harmful for amphibian species, characterized by disjunct breeding habitats. The dispersal behaviour of amphibians being poorly understood, it is crucial to develop new tools, allowing us to determine the influence of landscape connectivity on the persistence of populations. In this study, we developed a new landscape genetics approach that aims at identifying land-uses affecting genetic differentiation, without a priori assumptions about associated ecological costs. We surveyed genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci for 19 Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) populations in western Switzerland. Using strips of varying widths that define a dispersal corridor between pairs of populations, we were able to identify land-uses that act as dispersal barriers (i.e. urban areas) and corridors (i.e. forests). Our results suggest that habitat destruction and landscape fragmentation might in the near future affect common species such as M. alpestris.

We investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the 200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover, species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also influenced species composition of bats and species richness of functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function in agricultural landscapes.",10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443&type=printable; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231029; http://mirjam-knoernschild.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Heim_et_al_2015.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/150231475; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4521758; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1034443H/abstract; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/table/pone.0134443.t002/; https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/26866; https://paperity.org/p/73755762/the-importance-of-landscape-elements-for-bat-activity-and-species-richness-in; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/; https://stri.si.edu/sites/publications/PDFs/2015_Tschapka_Knorschild.pdf; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,10,5,the importance of landscape elements for bat activity and species richness in agricultural areas,10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443&type=printable; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231029; http://mirjam-knoernschild.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Heim_et_al_2015.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/150231475; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4521758; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1034443H/abstract; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/table/pone.0134443.t002/; https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/26866; https://paperity.org/p/73755762/the-importance-of-landscape-elements-for-bat-activity-and-species-richness-in; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/; https://stri.si.edu/sites/publications/PDFs/2015_Tschapka_Knorschild.pdf; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134443

Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations.

Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes. Despite the abundant green surfaces present in Berlin, only 50% of them have direct access to freshwater surfaces, based on Urban Atlas land use land cover data.

The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness.

Although agriculture is a major factor in these land use changes, development of peri-urban areas is also driving the simplification of habitat structure through removal of both native and weedy understorey species and the subdivision of remnant habitat. This study investigated the influence of habitat modification and fragmentation on birds in an urbanizing area of south east Queensland, Australia. The influence of spatial factors, such as surrounding vegetation cover, was considered alongside that of site-level habitat factors (vegetation structure) including interspecific competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Spatial factors did not influence the abundance and species richness of small passerines, a group of conservation concern. However, site-level factors, specifically shrub density and interspecific competition from the noisy miner, had a substantial influence on small passerine species richness and abundance. The density of shrubs (which consisted mainly of the introduced weed Lantana camara) had a strong positive relationship with small passerines while the abundance of noisy miners had a strong negative influence. Consequently, protection of vegetation with an intact shrub layer in this developing area is essential for many small birds of conservation significance. Removal of weedy understorey plants should be accompanied by replacement with native shrubs. The results of the study emphasize that factors other than the spatial distribution of vegetation in the landscape need to be considered in order to develop appropriate conservation strategies.

This process is called biotic homogenization, which is usually studied at large scale from species lists. Our paper addresses the effects of urbanization on plant community at local scale in areas where urban policies are implemented. We focus on private gardens as they are the most common components of green spaces in European urbanized areas. They are also a place where exotic species are introduced. Observations were made on spontaneous flora sampled from gardens in two study sites of the French Mediterranean: a large city and a village located in an urbanizing rural area. We evaluated how urban landscape influences floristic similarity and how exotic species affect homogenization. We divided each study site in three built-up density zones. As the urbanization process of both sites did not take place at the same time, we were able to assess the effect of time on floristic similarity. Results indicate that floristic similarity is less important in high dense built-up areas than in low dense ones. Exotic species tend to reduce floristic similarity in city centers and increase floristic similarity in low dense built-up areas in both sites. Landscape metrics calculated in built-up areas surrounding the gardens influence floristic similarity. Lastly, we found that urban planning in terms of built-up density affects biodiversity distribution and that private gardens can provide landscape connectivity within urban areas.

Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties.

To fill this gap, we develop an ex-post evaluation approach which integrates counterfactual analysis and landscape graphs. Counterfactual analysis is combined with cellular automata simulation model, to uncover what the city might look like, if it had continued to expand in a monocentric structure; and the landscape graphs enable us to reveal the possible landscape connectivity in actual and counterfactual scenarios. We select Nanjing city as the study area and 4 target species, to delve into the varying impacts of the urban structure shift on different taxonomic groups.

Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4. Results: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves.

Indirect estimates of connectivity inferred from these genetic data were complemented by direct estimates of post-breeding dispersal of juvenile boobooks gathered from banding data resulting from this and other studies across Australia.

We show, for the first time, that anthropogenic gradients structure interaction networks, and exert greater structuring force than geographical proximity. We further showed that species turnover, especially of plants, is the major driver of interaction turnover, and that this contribution increased with anthropogenic induced environmental dissimilarity, but not spatial distance. Finally, to explore the extent to which it is possible to predict each of the components of interaction turnover, we compared the predictive performance of models that included site characteristics and interaction properties to models that contained species level effects. We show that if we are to accurately predict interaction turnover, data are required on the species-specific responses to environmental gradients.

This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape.

However, it is not clear how urbanization affects amphibian communities at both local (pond) and landscape scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings.

Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds.

Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.",10.1371/journal.pone.0125719,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929121313&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0125719&partnerID=40&md5=419b3af72eab22772acca1083abc8c87,10,4,"nest suitability, fine-scale population structure and male-mediated dispersal of a solitary ground nesting bee in an urban landscape",10.1371/journal.pone.0125719,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4423849; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125719; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25950429/; https://core.ac.uk/display/150314122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950429; https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/nest-suitability-fine-scale-population-structure-and-male-mediate; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125719; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1025719L/abstract; https://paperity.org/p/61860772/nest-suitability-fine-scale-population-structure-and-male-mediated-dispersal-of-a

Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.",10.1017/S0007485317000153,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013997268&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485317000153&partnerID=40&md5=87d7a82f0bc4fcb287170b96281d2e9d,107,2,"floral abundance, richness, and spatial distribution drive urban garden bee communities",10.1017/S0007485317000153,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013997268&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485317000153&partnerID=40&md5=87d7a82f0bc4fcb287170b96281d2e9d

Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations. To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments. Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2 x 2 km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses. For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of broadleaved woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations. At the 2 x 2 km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages.

Here, we compared testate amoeba communities in Moscow (63 samples from five urban parks) and Xiamen (69 samples from six urban parks) across four biotopes (tree hole, moss, soil, and sediment) to better understand microbial diversity and ecological processes shaping microbial communities. A total of 116 morphospecies (31 genera), corresponding to 90 in Moscow and 84 in Xiamen, were identified using light microscopy. The species richness per sample (mean +/- standard error) was higher in Moscow parks (14 +/- 1 species, n = 63) than Xiamen parks. The mean species richness per biotope was highest in the mosses (13 +/- 1 species, n = 33). 13-26% of the total species richness was shared by all biotopes, indicating the ubiquitous distribution of testate amoeba morphospecies. The community composition in different biotopes markedly differed in both Moscow and Xiamen regions. Community connectivity varied among biotopes, and community complexity and dynamics were substantially stronger in soil and sediment. The stochastic processes explained a significantly high percentage of community composition in all biotopes (57-81%) in 11 parks. The standardized effect size for C-score in all biotopes changed from 1.48 to 6.92, indicating the enhanced significance of deterministic processes for the testate amoeba communities.

Success of eradications is dependent on knowledge of population connectivity in order to determine reinvasion pathways, and hence populations requiring simultaneous eradication (eradication units). The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was introduced into New Zealand from Australia and Tasmania, and now occupies a wide range of habitats across the majority of New Zealand. Possums are one of the most destructive invaders within New Zealand, with extensive control operations occurring throughout the country. Understanding the population connectivity of possums on mainland New Zealand (North and South Islands) will enhance the success of planned eradications. We examined the genetic population structure of invasive possums to identify gene flow, thus reinvasion pathways, between seven populations around Dunedin and on the Otago Peninsula where eradication of possums is occurring. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite loci was comparable between all sampled populations and exhibited a significant isolation by distance pattern. Bayesian clustering methods supported the existence of two population clusters, indicating the presence of a reinvasion pathway onto the Otago Peninsula from urban areas at the Southern end of the Peninsula. To avoid recolonisation, all possums on the Otago Peninsula should be eradicated simultaneously, with the implementation and ongoing maintenance and monitoring of an urban buffer zone.

We mapped 33 surveys of stingless bees nests located in Cerrado areas (25 sampled by us and 8 from literature) on Landsat images and assessed the proportions of vegetated, urban and rural areas within a radius of 3 km from each nest. We performed two-step cluster analyses separately for common and rare Meliponini species and Melipona species and assessed the proportion of vegetation in the resulting clusters.

Some species, such as Oxytrigona tataira Smith, occurred predominantly in degraded areas. Most Melipona species were uncommon or absent in the degraded areas.

The concept of urban structure types (UST) allows the dynamics of a growing urban environment to be captured in its quantity and quality. They are defined as areas of homogenous appearance in the urban matrix with a recognisable mixture of built-up areas and open spaces. We used the vegetation-impervious-soil (V-I-S) model approach to classify and monitor different types of USTs in Santiago (similar to 800 km2), Chile between 1985 and 2015. The V-I-S model is based on a simplification of the large diversity of urban land cover types in three general categories: vegetation, impervious surfaces and soil. These categories were obtained by processing Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images. First, we applied standard radiometric calibration and co-registration methods to all datasets. Second, using a linear spectral unmixing algorithm we performed a soft classification of urban land cover types (end members): trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, soils, buildings, roads and water bodies. All end members were validated using a combination of photointerpretation on high-resolution images (similar to 1 m) and field data collection (only for 2015). In each pixel we used the resulting probability scores, logically grouped, to obtain final values for each V-I-S component. Third, we used statistical clustering of V-I-S values to create a set of eight pixel groups, which we interpreted as USTs and mapped them for each date. The overall accuracy for V-I-S components in 1985 and 2015 were 78% and 82%, respectively, and errors did not exhibit any spatial correlation. The main sources of differentiation between USTs were the trade-off proportions between vegetation and impervious components, whereas soil proportions remained near 5% across the city in both dates. To analyse the change in UST spatial configuration between dates, we used a set of selected landscape metrics and discussed their use as indicators for sustainable urban development. These indicators relate to the dispersion pattern of urban growth, the connectivity of open green space and the complexity in the composition of the UST types within the different sectors of the city. We were able to identify, using the dynamics exhibited by the USTs, three main zones: (1) city centre, where USTs of high-intensity development predominate, (2) eastern high-income areas whose spatial structure is marked by a relatively high urbanisation intensity with a very large proportion of vegetated spaces, and (3) peripheral areas, with significant changes in composition and configuration of USTs, in recent decades, showing high rates of urbanisation, shifting from low-medium to high densities. We concluded that these patterns and their dynamics are mainly determined by the spatial socio-economic stratification of the population.",10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-873-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979529820&doi=10.5194%2fisprsarchives-XLI-B8-873-2016&partnerID=40&md5=956205d1216ed8c69b82c2830c6ff330,41,3,urban morphological dynamics in santiago (chile): proposing sustainable indicators from remote sensing,10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-873-2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979529820&doi=10.5194%2fisprsarchives-XLI-B8-873-2016&partnerID=40&md5=956205d1216ed8c69b82c2830c6ff330

For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density, the Human Footprint Index, and impervious surface cover, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found minimal evidence, either positive or negative, for relationships between genetic metrics and urbanization. Together with previous work on focal species that also found varying effects of urbanization on genetic composition, it seems likely that the consequences of urbanization are not easily generalizable within or across amphibian species. Questions about the genetic consequences of urbanization for amphibians should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This contrasts with general negative effects of urbanization in mammals and consistent, but species-specific, positive and negative effects in birds.",10.1111/mec.16005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107795987&doi=10.1111%2fmec.16005&partnerID=40&md5=60c346df156f11ef5647894fe1a072f0,30,2,the population genetics of urban and rural amphibians in north america,10.1111/mec.16005,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34053153; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.16005

Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management.

However, while some species remain common others are rare and have declined at a sharper rate. The Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) is classified as 'Endangered' on the Irish Red List, and 'Vulnerable' at European level. We aimed to investigate the ecology of B. distinguendus within the wider bumblebee community in its only remaining Irish population to inform conservation management. Eight true bumblebee species were recorded in total in four habitat types surveyed, with highest species richness in species-rich grassland and highest abundance in urban habitats. Highest numbers of B. distinguendus were found in two designated nature reserves. However, outside these reserves the species was only found in three of twelve sites surveyed in both species-rich and coastal grassland habitats. B. distinguendus is a late emerging species in this region with a foraging preference for Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Availability of key forage species was lowest when numbers of B. distinguendus were highest, potentially limiting survival of this species. Some smaller suitable habitats in urban areas and roadside verges were not used by the species, which suggests potential issues with habitat connectivity, patch size and/or availability of nesting and hibernation sites. Implications for insect conservation Based on our findings, we suggest that existing species-rich and coastal grassland sites should be conserved, and other areas restored, for B. distinguendus in Ireland. Conservation management should focus on delaying cutting grasslands until late September, winter grazing of stock and reducing pesticides and fertilisers with the aim of increasing forage availability in late season, and ensuring that suitable habitats are connected in the landscape to allow adequate habitat area as well as movement and dispersal of the species to new areas.",10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101567501&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-021-00299-7&partnerID=40&md5=c0360dcc3fed554f9755e3cbdcf87df9,25,3,investigating the ecology of the great yellow bumblebee (bombus distinguendus) within the wider bumblebee community in north-west ireland,10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7

We analyzed the genetic variability and gene flow rates in four Italian sparrow populations sampled in areas affected by different levels of human activity Population variability was analyzed by DNA fingerprinting with M13 multilocus minisatellite probe, which yielded multibanded fingerprints (the average number of bands was 25, ranging in size from 23 kb to 0.3 kb). The population located within the pristine area of the Cilento-Vallo di Diano National Park (San Marco) showed the higher value of within-population similarity (Sw = 0.73). This suggests a probable higher level of inbreeding in comparison with the other localities. The genetic isolation of the San Marco population is also imputable to the between-populations similarity values (Sb), that seem to be related with a preferential direction of gene circulation along urbanised corridors. The results show that population variability and gene flow rate in the Italian sparrow are directly related to the presence of urbanised areas.

However, regional development measures are needed for the nation's economic growth, and without responsible government actions, these measures pose a threat to brown bear connectivity, a vital pillar of the entire Carpathian region. Despite having important implications for the species conservation, bears sex-specific behaviour has been overlooked in connectivity assessments. Objectives The study's main goals were to (i) develop sex-specific distribution and connectivity models, (ii) assess the movement patterns differences between females and males, and (iii) identify high-quality areas to be secured for species connectivity conservation. Methods We designed a methodological framework based on interdisciplinary approaches and modelling tools for landscape connectivity combined with novel spatial analysis. Telemetry data of sixteen bears (females and males) were utilized to predict habitat selection (MaxEnt), and circuit-theoretic approaches (Circuitscape) were applied to identify the potential movement corridors of both sexes and high-priority areas. Results The obtained results provided new evidence on the uneven movement patterns and pathways used by males and females in the study region. Males' movement preferences were related to river shores and dense forest coverage areas, avoiding urban areas, while females were predicted to move across forested and open areas and were more tolerant to human-modified areas. Three high-quality areas were delineated for both sexes, and connectivity conservation efforts are needed due to the vicinity of anthropic pressures. Conclusions This study depicts the usefulness of combining interdisciplinary approaches and provides planners, managers, and decision-makers with practical solutions to address sustainable design and management within the intervened landscapes.

Here, the possibility of applying the migratory connectivity framework to understanding contamination in birds is illustrated by considering flame retardants in inviable eggs of a migratory raptor, the black kite (Milvus migrans). The occurrence and concentration of legacy and emerging compounds in eggs from the southeastern peri-urban area of Madrid city, central Spain, were compared with those from Donana National Park in southern Spain. A much higher occurrence and concentration of multiple polybrominated diphenyl ethers and Dechlorane 602 were found in Madrid than Donana, but the opposite patterns were found for Dechlorane Plus. Individuals from these and other breeding areas in western Europe showed a strong intermixing pattern over widespread wintering areas in Africa, as assessed by ringing recoveries and movements tracked by satellite devices. This diffuse migratory connectivity reveals breeding areas as the main contamination grounds. High contamination burdens sequestered in eggs point to rapid assimilation of these compounds before laying, associated with important emission sources in Madrid, especially landfills of partially incinerated urban refuse, and other anthropogenic operations. Diet composition regarding aquatic vs. terrestrial prey, and bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes are suggested to explain differential assimilation of some compounds, especially Dechlorane Plus in Donana, although a local emission source polluting this area cannot be ruled out. Insight from the migratory connectivity framework can help to disentangle large-scale patterns of contaminant uptake and refocus attention on key regions and potential causes of chemical hazards in declining migratory species and human populations.",10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049089436&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2018.06.037&partnerID=40&md5=37e2475c33fdec28a4e5cea20431c6ca,166,8,integrating population connectivity into pollution assessment: overwintering mixing reveals flame retardant contamination in breeding areas in a migratory raptor,10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.037,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29960221; https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/196318; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193052995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118303414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29960221; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ER....166..553B/abstract; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6465367

This remains particularly difficult for species where there is no obvious demarcation of geographical populations and dispersal patterns are poorly known.

Sampling of such species usually occurs in the aquatic habitat (i.e., breeding sites) but these may represent neither genetically nor demographically distinct populations. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure of a stream-breeding species, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) along a rural-to-urban land use gradient. We used genetic data and Bayesian clustering approaches, which rely on genetic information without assuming predefined populations, to delineate distinctive genetic units along this gradient, and compare genetic diversity between rural and urban areas. The different analytical approaches used partitioned our dataset in slightly different but highly congruent clusters, that included localities which were up to 19 km apart from each other. Genetic breaks occurred at unexpected places while several landscape features reported to act as barriers on gene flow for amphibians did not lead to genetic breaks.

We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at < 8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance.

Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.

A key unanswered question is how urban subpopulations interact with their precedent exurban subpopulations. Two general models have been proposed to describe relationships among subpopulations in a metapopulation: (1) source-sink, where immigrants from sources sustain sinks; and (2) balanced dispersal, where dispersal is proportionally equal among subpopulations. I evaluated whether either of these models predict metapopulation dynamics of urban and exurban Cooper's Hawks in central New Mexico using demographic data in a Bayesian integrated population model. All urban female Cooper's Hawks began breeding in their first year; 69% settled at nests in the urban subpopulation and 31% emigrated and settled in an exurban subpopulation. The high rate of female emigration was likely because of a shortage of breeding urban males, caused by a 1 yr delay in male age-at-first-breeding. Emigration exceeded immigration by nearly 30%, making a balanced-dispersal model implausible. Although the urban subpopulation was a source, the primary recipient subpopulation was not a sink; urban emigrants appeared to have a competitive advantage obtaining exurban nest sites. High urban winter prey abundance supported year-long residency among urban female Cooper's Hawks, whereas nearly all exurban females migrated. Resident urban females that emigrated settled on exurban nesting territories before migrants returned, and thus without direct competition from them. Previous metapopulation models do not incorporate the concept that differences in dispersal behavior between subpopulations can drive dispersal dynamics in a metapopulation. These findings provide further evidence that patch dynamics in a metapopulation can be complex, and may be governed by factors other than just demographic rates and connectivity.",10.1650/CONDOR-17-124.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038422830&doi=10.1650%2fCONDOR-17-124.1&partnerID=40&md5=c2821ee620deab4327452d63bc24b0d7,120,1,demography and metapopulation dynamics of an urban cooper's hawk subpopulation,10.1650/CONDOR-17-124.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038422830&doi=10.1650%2fCONDOR-17-124.1&partnerID=40&md5=c2821ee620deab4327452d63bc24b0d7

Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other.

Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland) remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants.

The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention.

At the southernmost extent of the species' range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover; used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys); and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night.

It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human-altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human-mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee,Xylocopa virginica,across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat.X. virginicais a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human-associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human-altered areas as compared to semi-natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional-scale population structure across the study system (GMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEST = 0.146) and substantial co-ancestry between the sampling regions, where co-ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human-mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site-level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (<1 km), surprising givenX. virginica'slarge body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity.",10.1111/eva.13078,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089973858&doi=10.1111%2feva.13078&partnerID=40&md5=cec687f016e19da6c85dc4c7dbfb629d,14,2,"genetic structure across urban and agricultural landscapes reveals evidence of resource specialization and philopatry in the eastern carpenter bee,xylocopa virginical",10.1111/eva.13078,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819568/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33519961; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13078

Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. tree cover were separately recorded on 252 randomly selected plots of 100 m(2), within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 to 218 ha. Multiple linear regressions indicated that forest patch history is the most important variable determining oak and pine tree cover: new forest patches showed higher pine and lower oak tree cover than recently split patches (i.e. those that became fragmented from large forest areas after 1956). Patches already existing as such in 1956 (pre-existent patches) showed higher pine cover than recently split patches. Oak cover increased and pine cover decreased with increasing forest connectivity of the patch. Finally, highly frequented forests were related to high cover of pines. Climatic and topographic variables were not significant. We conclude that pine and oak cover in these peri-urban forests are mainly determined by recent patch dynamics, but also by the spatial pattern of patches.

Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets.

However, the habitats that border roads ('road verges') form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES). We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km(2) and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle-wildlife collisions. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.",10.1111/1365-2664.13556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078061617&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.13556&partnerID=40&md5=24002fa401dbae54b55aaac741ee6e69,57,4,ecosystem service provision by road verges,10.1111/1365-2664.13556,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/39645/9/Phillips_et_al-2020-Journal_of_Applied_Ecology.pdf; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13556; https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/39645; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13556; https://core.ac.uk/download/266991703.pdf

However, human activities that fragment aerial habitat with built structures, noise, and chemical or light pollution, may limit the ability of wildlife to use airspace efficiently.

Artificial light at night is a major component of urbanization that fragments dark skies across North America. Attraction of nocturnal migrants to urban light is well documented, but species-specific responses, especially throughout a full migration from breeding to wintering grounds, are not. We tested hypotheses about long-distance migratory movements in relation to artificial light using a highly nocturnal, Nearctic-Neotropical avian migrant (Eastern whip-poor-will Antrostomus vociferus). We applied a resource selection framework at multiple spatial scales to explore whether GPS-tracked birds (n = 10) responded to urbanization in general, or artificial light specifically, during migratory flights. We found little evidence of attraction to artificial light during nocturnal flights. Artificial light and urbanization were highly correlated and difficult to disentangle, but the birds generally avoided urban areas and selected dark-connected skies for travel. Migratory stopovers (locations where GPS-tracked birds (n = 20) paused for at least one night), were located almost exclusively in dark, rural areas.

We identify and weight environmental factors that determine the suitability for wild boar populations in a Mediterranean region, highly influenced by urban and agro-forestry activities. Marina Baja region (Spain) is selected to make a regional analysis. In the GIS modelling process, a suitability value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the habitat preference of the species. In the potential habitat model some variables were considered, the most important being land use. Voronoi polygons are generated by calculating the centroid of census transects located with GPS. These polygons are combined with the 'suitability' layer to obtain potentiality values, involving the displacement of the wild boar impedances within each Voronoi polygon. Finally, it performs the cartographic generalization process to obtain the resulting potential areas. We have obtained six potential areas that represent 39% of the region and they are best for the species. Natural vegetation is the most important landcover type in these areas. The cost-distance model is an efficient tool that gives good results in line with existing knowledge of species distribution. The model is constructed in order to explain, understand and predict the relations of analysed species using a determinate number of environmental variables.

This phenomenon is destroying the balance of ecosystems, triggering the reduction of biodiversity and the decay of ecosystem service functions.

Based on landscape classification data and socioeconomic data for three years, this study analyzes the spatial correlations between socioeconomic and landscape pattern factors and HQ, compares the dynamic changes in the explanatory power of different factors, and explores the joint effects between multiple fac-tors. The results show that: (1) The overall value of HQ index in Zhengzhou City decreased by .10 during 2000???2020, mainly occurring in suburban areas, with a small amount of HQ improvement occurring in the core areas of ecological protection, such as mountains and river channels. (2) The spatial autocorrela-tion of all influencing factors with HQ increased during this period, while the negative impact from socio-economic sources was stronger than the positive impact from landscape patterns. (3) Intensive human activities lead to a single habitat type, which reduces HQ; rich landscape types and complex landscape composition can enhance HQ. Improving the connectivity of blue-green landscapes helps to attenuate the negative effects of urbanization on HQ. (4) Changes of HQ in the study area and the development of multi-factor effects on HQ are driven by the Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area Plan.

Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual-based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban-to-rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near-panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban-to-rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution.

Establishing native species assemblages on green roofs may help conserve native plant diversity in urban areas, but these assemblages are susceptible to colonization by species from the surrounding landscape. In natural communities, colonization from the regional species pool reflects the filtering effects of both abiotic and biotic factors, but the relative effects of these factors on green roof colonization are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied colonization dynamics of 10 green roofs in New York City (NY, United States), each established at the same time with the same source materials. On each roof, 12 plots were established, with one-half of each plot planted with an erect C-4 graminoid dominant (Hempstead Plains: HP) and the other half with a tuft C-3 graminoid and forb dominant (Rocky Summit: RS) species assemblage derived from native communities. Six of the 12 split-plots contained shallow growing medium, while the other six contained deeper growing medium. Resident plants were planted in October 2010. Fifty-eight non-resident plant species colonized plots between August 2011 and August 2012, with two native and 10 non-native species accounting for 90% of total colonist dry mass. Colonist dry mass and richness decreased with increasing resident plant cover, but the effects of growing medium depth on colonist dry mass and richness differed between assemblages. Forbs accounted for 81% of the colonist dry mass from the HP assemblage, but just 31% in the RS assemblage. Further, forbs accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in June and July, while graminoids accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in August. These results indicate colonization of planted green roofs may be strongly affected by the composition of established plant assemblages and that these effects may vary temporally with colonist management regime, even within a single growing season. Further, the inconsistent effects of growing medium depth suggest that niche overlap and complementarity in rhizosphere dynamics may influence colonization more in some systems compared with others. Additional research is required to describe the effects of colonist management strategies, as well as the roles of priority effects, niche complementarity and community assembly, on long-term dynamics of colonization on green roofs planted with native plants.",10.3389/fevo.2018.00238,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full,6,4,plant colonization of green roofs is affected by composition of established native plant communities,10.3389/fevo.2018.00238,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full

A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population.

Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended.

Over the course of two years, a monthly sampling was carried out on a 270 m trail across the Reserve from 08:00 to 12:00, collecting all the individuals located within 5 m on each side of the trail. To better represent the richness, individuals were also randomly collected for more than ten years, but the butterflies collected in this way were not included in the statistical analysis. Photographs were taken of all the species in order to provide an identification guide. For the cryptic species, drawings and dissections of the genitalia were made. For the community indexes we used Microsoft Excel and the Shannon index with base two logarithm. For the summary of the monthly data analysis were done according to dry and wet season.

The dry seasons are also grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The reserve has connectivity with other green areas via a stream. During the wet season, plant growth increases connectivity, which could lead to the entry of new individuals of different species that are not permanent residents of RELO and establish small populations, increasing the richness and abundance of species.

Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong'an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities. Methods. A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity. Results. Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD). Discussion. Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species ff-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region.

I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km(2)) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas.

Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity.

We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from 17 green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dry-habitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most influential factors affecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats.",10.1016/j.ufug.2017.11.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034829208&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2017.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=6a6f7b8b7c8290c52614967d74fb7485,29,6,local habitat characteristics have a stronger effect than the surrounding urban landscape on beetle communities on green roofs,10.1016/j.ufug.2017.11.009,https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/local-habitat-characteristics-have-a-stronger-effect-than-the-sur; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866717301802; https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11310

Light pollution is a near inseparable feature of human-altered landscapes and is a potential contributing factor to insect declines. However, despite the wide recognition of the deleterious effects of lights on insects, whether these effects scale up to impact insect populations remains unclear. Here, we relied on a combination of ecological niche modeling, geographical information systems, and interviews on local ecological knowledge to assess the synergistic effects of landscape light pollution and habitat loss and fragmentation on populations of the Choc ' o golden scarab Chrysina argenteola. Sightings of C. argenteola by locals revealed individuals are scarcer in areas with reduced forest cover and rely on inter-patch dispersal to cope with habitat fragmentation, where they were constantly attracted to urban lights. Increasingly lit landscapes had more individuals attracted to lights, but the opposite was true in areas with less than 4 km2 of remaining forest cover. We suggest this pattern arises as landscape light pollution intercepts individuals during inter-patch dispersal. This hinders habitat connectivity, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics, being populations inhabiting areas with scarce fragmented habitat more vulnerable to this process.

Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.",10.3390/su141912123,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139780457&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912123&partnerID=40&md5=4d7055fac262098eba44ac5139d4099f,14,3,"bird flight resistance analysis and planning strategies in urban regeneration areas: a case study of a certain area in shenzhen, china",10.3390/su141912123,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724317606?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=BfKrLFUkPsV779vhO52gmRh9uoQ%3D

In the 21st century, urban development and sea level rise (SLR) are predicted to affect large areas of the United States, further exacerbating already fragmented and densely populated landscapes. Increasing or restoring habitat connectivity may ameliorate these effects, but the broad-reaching efforts required to assess current and future changes to connectivity, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to SLR, are still under development. To address these issues, we strategically identified a small group of regionally significant species that represent a range of characteristics and ecological requirements useful for examining landscape connectivity. We used expert opinion to parameterize divergent species responses (i.e. resistance) to landscape features and to assess permeability of the landscape. From this, we estimated contemporary and future low-resistance habitat cores in the year 2100. We modeled six species for habitat connectivity using a multiscaled circuit theory-based approach and analysed them collectively to indicate landscape connectivity across the Southeastern United States. Using this approach, we were able to forecast changing connectivity patterns based on predicted urbanization and SLR. Our results suggest that there will be a 41% reduction in the number of low-resistance cores and a 35% decrease in mean area of remaining cores. In addition, current areas of high landscape connectivity will become more fragmented as future connectivity values indicate a more homogenized landscape structure. In the future landscape, pathways for connectivity are likely to move inland and northward as sea level and urbanization pressures increase.

A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately ""wildlife-friendly"", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0259537,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118985924&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0259537&partnerID=40&md5=76b01a35119c4e640228a6e09aedf52d,16,4,an assessment of a conservation strategy to increase garden connectivity for hedgehogs that requires cooperation between immediate neighbours: a barrier too far?,10.1371/journal.pone.0259537,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259537; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34739512

In recent years, increasing efforts have been directed towards the restoration and revitalization of disturbed streams and rivers to reverse this trend. Although it is widely acknowledged that species dispersal is the key to the recolonization of restored streams and rivers and ultimately to their ecological recovery, dispersal often remains unaddressed in restoration ecology. In this study, we present an approach to predict larval (aquatic) and adult (terrestrial) dispersal ranges of three lotic insect species (Hydropsyche dinarica [Trichoptera], Calopteryx virgo [Odonata] and Dinocras cephalotes [Plecoptera]) within one life cycle. The actual species' distributions (presence / absence) were obtained from a total of 1,198 sites evenly distributed within the Ruhr catchment, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The predictions for aquatic and terrestrial dispersal were made for two scenarios: with and without dispersal barriers included in the predictive modelling. In-stream dispersal barriers included weirs, dams, culverts and impounded water bodies, whereas terrestrial barriers were related to the stream corridor (degraded riparian vegetation) and different forms of land use (urban land use, coniferous and deciduous or mixed forest, open land, road infrastructure). We applied a least-cost modelling approach and combined each species' life-cycle-specific dispersal capabilities and the corresponding dispersal barrier's ""friction"" costs in a gridbased GIS model. Among the three model species, H. dinarica was the best disperser and was predicted to be able to reach between 81 % (without barriers) and 67 % (with barriers) of all river sections in the model catchment within one life cycle. Aerial (terrestrial) dispersal was by far the most important dispersal mechanism. For validation purposes, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify sample sites with environmentally suitable habitats. Within these sites that are not considered constrained by habitat limitations, the comparison of actual and predicted absences revealed a better match, if barriers were included in the dispersal models. At the same time the mismatch of actual absences and predicted presences decreased. Our results suggest that dispersal models can contribute to a better assessment of the potential recolonization of rivers.

Here, we assemble a large cross-taxa inventory of 1446 species from 12 taxonomic groups, including several understudied invertebrate groups, sampled in 251 sites in Zurich, Switzerland. We investigate the species diversity distributions and the structure of species assemblages along artificial urban ecological gradients by applying predictive models. We find that the general species diversity distribution law, where assemblages are dominated by a few very abundant and frequent species, applied consistently across all taxonomic groups (3% of the species accounting for approximately 50% of abundance). Furthermore, only species of intermediate abundance and frequency are spatially structured along urban intensity gradients, with rare species numbers keeping constant even in the most urbanised parts of the city. In addition, we show that green areas with low mowing regimes are associated with higher species diversity in the majority of taxonomic groups.

UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a significant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city.

These threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance, but ultimately ecosystem functions and services. Thus, seed dispersers such as the straw-coloured fruit bat, E. helvum, which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes, are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking of movements, field observations and gut retention experiments, we quantify dispersal distances for small-and large-seeded fruits foraged by E. helvum during periods of colony population low (wet season) and high (dry season) in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of Ghana. Gut passage time averaged 116 min (range 4-1143 min), comparable to other fruit bats. Movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season. As the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts, median dispersal distances were similar for both large (42-67 m) and small (42-65 m) seeds. However, small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 75.4 km, four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similar-sized frugivore. Maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural (49.7 km) compare to the urban (31.2 km) landscape. Within the urban landscape, estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season (75.4 km) compared to the wet season (22.8 km); in contrast, distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season (67 km) compared to the dry season (24.4). Dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season (551 m) in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season (319 m). We found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances. The maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts (mean distance from food tree 263 m) was 4.7%. Small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances, >500 and >1000 m, with a likelihood of 3.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. Our data show that E. helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances, probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical Africa. We suggest E. helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

China is among the countries undergoing the fastest urban expansion. For a long time, ecological environment protection has not been a priority in China's urban planning process. Current urban growth optimization research has some limitations regarding the selection of more scientific ecological constraint indicators and the interaction between urban expansion and ecological factors. This paper at first aimed to establish a reasonable comprehensive biodiversity constraint indicator based on the indicators of net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality, and then conducted a case study in Beijing and compared biodiversity loss and urban growth patterns under different developing situations. The integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model and GIS-related methods were used to obtain biodiversity and ecological spatial distribution layers. Then an ecological priority-oriented urban growth simulation method was proposed to search for minimum biodiversity loss. The results showed that the important biodiversity security areas were mostly distributed in the western part of the study area and that the ecological degradation in 2000 had a radial pattern and was well in line with the urban construction and ring road distribution patterns.

Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.",10.1111/gcb.14151,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049502770&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.14151&partnerID=40&md5=ded7075d349fd083ce5081c6db8dff0f,24,3,increased body size along urbanization gradients at both community and intraspecific level in macro-moths,10.1111/gcb.14151,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GCBio..24.3837M/abstract; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14151; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29791767; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29791767/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791767

Degradation, pollution, and deterioration along riparian corridors in urban landscapes change species composition and biodiversity. Birds are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ecological changes. The main objective of our study was to spatially compare bird species richness, abundance, and community structure along the Asar River, an urban riparian corridor in Duzce, Turkey. We identified 63 bird species, comprising 6722 individuals, and classified them into one of three groups: generalist species (11 species), woodland species (40 species), and waterbird species (12 species). Bird species richness was positively related to vegetative cover and negatively to urbanization. Richness was low in the winter and was higher during spring and summer. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores (mean = 54.8 +/- 33.7; max. = 97 and min. = 5) were relatively low for all sampling plots and was reduced by human activities (e.g., roads, farmland, settlement). The number of woodland bird species changed positively (r = 0.71) with RQI. The generalist bird species, adapted to urbanization, were more common around settlements and open areas. Human population and settlement around Asar River increased one-third and farmland and natural habitat decreased onefifth during the last decade. The area has high potential for growth and increased urbanization, thus increasing the pressure on the natural areas. Activities that diminish the amount of tree cover in the riparian corridor should be avoided. Habitat restoration and rehabilitation will increase RQI values, which can be used as indicators for bird richness in urban landscapes and benefit avian diversity along the riparian corridor.

In this study, the parks in Kucukcekmece District were examined in terms of ecological quality, principles, and standards. Ecological quality is a composite of the structural and functional features determining the habitat values of a landscape. An objective evaluation on the ecological quality of parks is important from the point of rehabilitation from an existing situation, and providing areas which will have high habitat value in the future. Recovery in the existing park area will generate a livable urban atmosphere. In line with this basic comprehension, the ecological quality of the parks in Istanbul's Kucukcekmece District was examined. There are four principles determining ecological quality of an area: vegetative production, water, permeability (soil), and natural vegetation cover (biological diversity). This research was done in two phases regarding the permeability and natural vegetation cover using ecological quality principles. In the first phase of the study, a vegetation list was provided by the Park and Garden Department of the Kucukcekmece Municipality, The park names and size were acquired from the ""Kucukcekmece District green corridor Transformation Project"". The space where the soil surface is covered by soil material, or is suppressed because of overuse and can not sustain plant growth is accepted as an impermeable soil surface. Whether there is a relation between park areas and permeable surface areas was examined using the Spearman correlation test. Whether permeability ratio of parks changes according to their location was analyzed using the Chi-Square test. In the second stage of the study, the existing vegetation cover was analyzed on-site. Existing vegetation cover analysis is made according to trees, shrubs, bushes, flowers, and trailings. Findings of, this study show that the average permeability ratio is 35.19% and the naturality ratio is 52% in the 63 parks under examination. This study shows that the permeable land surfaces of the parks remain incapable of sustaining vegetative growth and therefore the habitat values of the park areas, which can have an economic, social and ecologic contribution to the urban environment, will reduce. Result of this study will contribute to the sampling used for the ecological quality principles in other parks in other districts.

Ponds also provide important habitats for species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment. Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity. However, there is a need for a finer-scale investigation of the different potential mechanism in which residents in areas with differing socio-economic status could indirectly influence ponds.",10.1007/s11252-017-0673-2,https://core.ac.uk/display/132543159; https://nrm.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1154313; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5868603; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-017-0673-2.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/79481104/is-there-a-relationship-between-socio-economic-factors-and-biodiversity-in-urban-ponds-a; http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1154313; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-017-0673-2,20,8,is there a relationship between socio-economic factors and biodiversity in urban ponds? a study in the city of stockholm,10.1007/s11252-017-0673-2,https://core.ac.uk/display/132543159; https://nrm.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1154313; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5868603; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-017-0673-2.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/79481104/is-there-a-relationship-between-socio-economic-factors-and-biodiversity-in-urban-ponds-a; http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1154313; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-017-0673-2

However, roads are also known to contribute toward a number of deleterious landscape processes, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution (e.g., chemical, noise and light) and animal mortality. Few studies however have investigated their effects on avifauna. We investigated the influence of road width on movements of nearby bird assemblages in Australia by comparing crossing counts of four species guilds and sizes over roads of varying widths in Southern Brisbane. In addition, we also sought to determine the association of seasonality with species crossing richness and abundance. Species guild affiliations were based on definitions from previous literature: small forest dependent, large forest dependent, honeyeater, and urban tolerant; whereas body size classifications were arbitrarily defined: small (< 20 cm), medium (20-29 cm), and large (> 30 cm). Road sites were selected based on their vegetation likeness, both within and between sites, and this was assessed using the Specht classification system. We detected strong, negative correlations between road width and forest species richness, crossing species richness and species crossing abundance. In particular, analysis of species guild classifications revealed species richness and crossing likelihoods of the small forest dependent guild to be consistently lower than those of large forest dependent, honeyeater and urban tolerant guilds. Analysis of species by body size classification yielded similar outcomes: small birds were consistently less likely to be present nearby and cross over roads of all widths compared to medium and large birds. We believe gap permeability, particularly changes in vegetation structure and complexity that may restrict a species ability to access to the gap, as well as competition and predation, play an important role in determining species presence and crossing likelihood.

The nature of the matrix impacts the persistence of species in human-modified landscapes through its pervasive influence on adjacent habitat and through the habitat value of the matrix itself. However, previous studies have not isolated the effects of the matrix from the effects of other aspects of landscape modification, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, and much remains to be understood about the independent impact of the matrix on wildlife. We investigated the effects of the matrix on mammal abundance and landscape use in south-east Queensland, Australia. Mammals were surveyed in patch 'core', patch 'edge' and 'matrix' landscape elements along a rural-suburban gradient of matrix development intensity quantified by a weighted road-length metric, which was significantly correlated with housing density, while controlling for potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes. Response to increasing matrix development intensity was highly species-specific. Several native species declined in abundance; however, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels of matrix development intensity. Exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. An ability to use the matrix per se, however, may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix.",10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x/abstract; https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:238258; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x; https://core.ac.uk/display/15113896; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113069278,36,5,mammal responses to matrix development intensity,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x/abstract; https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:238258; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x; https://core.ac.uk/display/15113896; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113069278

We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity.

Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human-carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes. The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range.

Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity.

We performed the experiment in winter and late summer near Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. We recorded 1078 travel paths from 6 resident and 12 migratory species in 249 experimental sites. In both seasons, birds preferred to travel under forest cover rather than cross open areas, even when the forested detour conveyed a substantially longer route than the short cut in the open. Only when the detour under forest cover. This was considerably longer than the short-cut in the open, in both relative and absolute terms, were birds more likely to take short cuts, indicating that gap-crossing decisions are scale dependent. However, birds rarely ventured > 25 m from forest edges despite having the opportunity to do so.

The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production. The positive contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are observed at distance thresholds exceeding 200 m at the landscape scale, which allows us to capture the response of habitat priority to landscape dynamics. Accordingly, we develop a balanced conservation strategy for multiple species and the targeted conservation measures based on the coupled analysis of quality and conservation priority of habitat patches.

Current federal wetland regulations in the United States do not protect isolated wetlands or extend protection to surrounding terrestrial habitat. Consequently, some land managers, city planners, and policy makers at the state and local levels are making an effort to protect these wetland and neighboring upland habitats. Balancing human land-use and habitat conservation is challenging, and well-informed land-use policy is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the specific risks of varying amounts of habitat loss. Using projections of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations, we related the amount of high-quality terrestrial habitat surrounding isolated wetlands to the decline and risk of extinction of local amphibian populations. These simulations showed that current state-level wetland regulations protecting 30 m or less of surrounding terrestrial habitat are inadequate to support viable populations of pool-breeding amphibians. We also found that species with different life-history strategies responded differently to the loss and degradation of terrestrial habitat. The wood frog, with a short life span and high fecundity, was most sensitive to habitat loss and isolation, whereas the longer-lived spotted salamander with lower fecundity was most sensitive to habitat degradation that lowered adult survival rates.

Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on ""where tree species should be in the future"" and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK.

Ants and other arthropods were surveyed on the bark of 341 trees in three types of arrangement: isolated trees, trees in linear corridors and trees in patches. Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees.

Green infrastructure (GI) is premised on the various social and ecological benefits of high-quality ESs that humans acquire from natural ecosystems; hence, the conservation of GI can be considered an effective way to safeguard ecological security and contain rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion. Taking Hangzhou, a typical ecologically sensitive but rapidly urbanizing area, as the case study, a GI network was established according to the quantification and mapping of diverse ES values. The equivalent ES value in China based on Xie?s table was adjusted by calculating the priority index and the spatial difference index, and then the adjusted value was applied to obtain the spatial distribution of the comprehensive ES value in Hangzhou. On this basis, the high-level spatial agglomeration area with the highest comprehensive ES value was extracted as a hub using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, while the accumulated channel with the lowest cost of comprehensive ES value was generated as a corridor through the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Both the established GI network and its buffer were delineated as the GI conservation area, which further supported the revision of the construction area in the Hangzhou Urban Master Plan (2020e2040), which was formulated by urban development policy to coordinate the conflicts between rapid urbanization and ecological protection. This study provides a characteristic example of how to establish GI networks based on ES evaluations and provides a strong reference for land-use and environmental planning in other developing countries and regions that are exposed to severe ecological deterioration. It also proves that GI network identification is not only applicable to ecological security safeguards but can also be regarded as a useful tool for containing rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion to shape and promote a sustainable urban growth pattern. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

At each site, we placed four 4 m x 5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate).

Urbanisation is one of the main land-use changes behind global insect collapse. Despite that previous studies have described the negative effects of urbanisation on insect communities, so far there is no synthesis that considers multiple urban drivers, their combined effects, and the role of species traits altogether. 2. Here we developed an integrative framework of the underlying mechanisms behind terrestrial insect species loss in cities by exploring five leading drivers: impervious surfaces, habitat fragmentation, urban heat island, pollution, and exotic plants. For each driver, we identified the main direct and indirect (mediated through species interactions or changes in resources) effects on insect populations and communities, emphasising the role of species traits as moderators of such effects. 3. Body size, mobility, and oviposition/nesting requirements were the traits that frequently defined insect vulnerability to urban drivers. Urban heat island and pollution deserve further research from a community-level approach. Direct effects of drivers dominated the literature, while most indirect paths were mediated by changes in resources rather than species interactions. 4. In conclusion, our review showed the challenges of recognising particular effects and mechanisms for each urban driver and their combined effects.

Within the city, community assembly processes vary among green space types and taxa resulting in important changes in community taxonomic and functional composition. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that urban community assembly is a multi-scale process dominated by the strong environmental filtering from a regional to an urban species pool. This leads to the selection of species pre-adapted to urban conditions. Spatial habitat heterogeneity within and among UGS types can maintain an important taxonomic diversity within cities. However, increasing urban functional diversity would require stronger management efforts that consider regional ecological processes.",10.1111/jbi.13772,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13772,47,3,the origin of urban communities: from the regional species pool to community assemblages in city,10.1111/jbi.13772,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13772

Shenzhen, as a highly urbanized area in China, is facing the dual pressures of urban development and ecological conservation. The ecological corridors in Shenzhen are being constantly eroded by urban expansion, resulting in an urgent need to carry out sensitivity evaluations and ecological land management studies. By identifying the spatial range of planned ecological corridors in Shenzhen, we develop a GIS-based ecological sensitivity evaluation model from the perspectives of soil environment, habitat conditions, geological hazards, and human disturbance. Management strategies are proposed with regard to macroscopic protection guidance and microscopic land-use control. The results show that there is little difference in the sensitivity grade of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. With regard to spatial distribution, the sensitivity level is high in the north and low in the south, with moderately sensitive corridors being the dominant type. Meanwhile, we design the land-use control program by taking into account the present management and new land demand and provide the path for implementing the withdrawal, reservation, occupation, and avoidance polices. The results of the sensitivity evaluation objectively reflect the eco-environmental condition of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. The classified and graded protection guidance and space regulatory framework proposed in this study are of significance for guiding the ecological conservation, land use, and sustainable development in urban contexts with similar issues.

Understanding movement patterns is crucial for the effective conservation of amphibian populations isolated by urban development. Here, we conducted a capture-recapture study over 6 years in a population of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) inhabiting a 7.3-ha patch of forest and disturbed land-use types in an urbanised catchment north-west of Budapest, Hungary. We investigated relationships between movement distances and environmental, spatial and demographic parameters in order to understand how this species is able to persist in a relatively small and isolated habitat patch. We found that most movement was aggregated around a permanent stream and that movement distances were generally <= 200 m, with maximum distances of 925 and 707 m for males and females, respectively. Movement patterns within the population were best modelled using a negative exponential function characterised by infrequent long-distance movement. Males had substantially larger home range sizes than females and were predicted to have larger movement distances. Mean movement distances were predicted to be larger in disturbed areas in the upper stream catchment which included residential areas, compared with smaller movements in more natural forest near the stream. There was a positive relationship between mean movement distance and body condition. Our results suggest that this local population persists in a relatively small habitat patch because it provides a stable breeding site and suitable foraging and shelter microhabitats.

Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces.

An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (gamma-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (alpha-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in alpha-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the alpha-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the alpha-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas.

Furthermore, we found the positive relationship between native and alien species richness existed across all the green spaces and was particularly prevalent in the artificial ones. Additionally, successful establishment of alien species instigated by anthropogenic disturbances and most frequent species assemblages caused biotic homogenization in the artificial habitats. In contrast, biotic differentiation in the near-natural habitats was still preserved due to a greater level of protection for native species, which showed some resistance against the establishment of alien species.

These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species' colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.04.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064317616&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2019.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=e9ad6c2c09775cbfe214a7c918f4ed96,103,4,"eco-estates: diversity hotspots or isolated developments? connectivity of eco-estates in the indian ocean coastal belt, kwazulu-natal, south africa",10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.04.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X1930250X; https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902289000642191

I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegetation structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird species richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual species. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species-particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes-to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improvements in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into account the target species of management.",10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0343963260&doi=10.1046%2fj.1523-1739.2000.98600.x&partnerID=40&md5=25960ff17321fad936825a01657fd415,14,1,avifaunal use of wooded streets in an urban landscape,10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20000612468; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x/abstract; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x/full; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x; https://www.bio.purdue.edu/people/faculty/faculty_files/publications/36207_118867181.PDF; https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98600.x; https://www.jstor.org/stable/2641616; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20000612468.html

However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.",10.3389/fevo.2022.779005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128435012&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2022.779005&partnerID=40&md5=5ab1c125cc2574e2014b273f9bfa530b,10,2,small urban green roof plots near larger green spaces may not provide additional habitat for birds,10.3389/fevo.2022.779005,NA

Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeatvisit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (x = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (x = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (x = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (x = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (x = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (x = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores.

How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution.

Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes.

Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters.

We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands.

Principal component analysis of environmental traits of 18 parks showed that plant traits in parks have relatively high and positive contribution. Correlation analysis indicated that bird diversity was positively affected by water area, the highest altitude, habitats diversity and tree evenness in park, while negatively regulated by building coverage around each park. The top 20 most abundant bird species accounted for 87.5% of the total birds in the study period. Nycticorax nycticorax, Urocissa erythroryncha and Podiceps ruficollis were observed more frequently in hillside parks, while Pycnonotus aurigaster, Passer montanus, Acridotheres cristatellus were observed more frequently in riverside parks. Principal coordinates analysis also indicated that bird communities significantly differed between hillside parks and riverside parks. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of conserving mountains and rivers as buffer zones for serious anthropogenic disturbance in the city center.

Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types. Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes.

Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as ""microreserves.''

From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species.

Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.",10.1007/s11284-014-1238-y,NA; html; html; html; unknown; html,30,23,determinants of tree frog calling ponds in a human-transformed landscape,10.1007/s11284-014-1238-y,NA; html; html; html; unknown; html

We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes.

We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments. Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m. Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

Here, we analyzed the samples of M. alternatus collected in a fine-scale in order to estimate the effects of landscape types on the genetic structure and dispersal of M. alternatus. The landscapes included the geographical scales, forest types and land uses. The individuals of M. alternatus were genotyped by using whole-genome resequencing. Population genetic structures were clearly differentiated at the range of 250 kms, suggesting the intermediate scale is an effective barrier against natural dispersal of M. alternatus. We used the least-cost distances, least-cost transect analysis, and distance-based redundancy analysis to estimate the effects of forest types and land uses within the fine scales. The results showed that the gene flow and genetic diversity were positively correlated with host and mixed forests, whereas negatively with non-host forests. Among land-use landscapes, the roads had the positive effect on gene flow and genetic diversity but farmland and urban uses had negative effects. This highlights that humanmediated transport via roads was likely to be the main factor leading to the long-distance invasion of M. alternatus, whereas non-host landscapes could suppress the spread of this species.

Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structuredexhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity.",10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05493.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862778502&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-294X.2012.05493.x&partnerID=40&md5=a0664332749440a07881997a883dbb2f,21,8,gene flow and pathogen transmission among bobcats (lynx rufus) in a fragmented urban landscape,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05493.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862778502&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-294X.2012.05493.x&partnerID=40&md5=a0664332749440a07881997a883dbb2f

Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected.

In this paper, we asked whether local (area of forest patches) and landscape (amount of suitable habitat surrounding of focal patches) factors affect the breeding success of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Tokyo, Central Japan. The breeding success of raccoon dogs is easy to judge as adults travel with pups during the breeding season. We selected 21 forest patches (3.3-797.8 ha) as study sites. In each forest patch, we used infrared-triggered cameras for a total of 60 camera days per site. We inspected each photo to determine whether it was of an adult or a pup. Although we found adult raccoon dogs in all 21 forest patches, pups were found only in 13 patches. To estimate probability of occurrence and detection for raccoon in 21 forest fragments, we used single season site occupancy models in PRESENCE program. Model selection based on AIC and model averaging showed that the occupancy probability of pups was positively affected by patch area. This result suggests that large forests improve breeding success of raccoon dogs. A major reason for the low habitat value of small, isolated patches may be the low availability of food sources and the high risk of being killed on the roads in such areas.

We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban - rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quanti. ed wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a signi. cant negative in. uence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post- breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad- scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes.

In addition, we observed nine species (10% of all species collected) that are conservation concerns in Switzerland and Central Europe as well as numerous stenotopic species (from grasslands and pioneer vegetation). This indicates that, besides sustaining local populations of common species, green roofs can also offer suitable ecological conditions of high conservation interest.

Based on the remote sensing images of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in the Yangtze River Basin in 2001-2019, the dynamic attitude and transfer matrix of LULC, and landscape pattern indices were employed to analyze the LUCC and the impact of LULC on the landscape pattern of the Yangtze River Basin. The results of LUCC show that the main LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2019 is mainly manifested by the increase of water body, forest, wetland, crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM) and urban, among which the forest increased the most by 62,635 km2. The areas of grassland and cropland are decreasing, with the grassland decreasing the most. Forest, crop/NVM and cropland are transformed into grassland, which complements the lack of grassland to some extent. LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin is most intense between grassland and forest. Landscape pattern shows: Grassland occupies an important advantage in the whole landscape structure. Forest, grassland and urban landscapes are seriously fragmented, and their LSI (Landscape Shape Index) is more complex than others. The connectivity between various landscape types is weakened, and the degree of landscape fragmentation is increased, but the LULC structure is becoming more and more abundant. The areas with high landscape fragmentation value have richer landscape diversity and diverse LULC types. There is a strong correlation between grassland and the four landscape pattern indices.

Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (HE: 0.224-0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region (Ne = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane (Ne = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity (HE: 0.188 - 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo pop-ulations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity.

However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird. The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations. Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry. Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations.

Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than ""natural"" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales.

We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and regional and fine-scale population structure in a currently widespread and common cooperatively breeding bird species found across south-eastern Australia, the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus. Despite its relative abundance and classification as an urban tolerant species, the superb fairy-wren has declined disproportionately from low tree-cover agricultural landscapes across the Box-Ironbark region of north-central Victoria, Australia. Loss of genetic connectivity and disruption to its complex social system may be associated with the decline of this species from apparently suitable habitat in landscapes with low levels of tree cover. To assess whether reduced structural connectivity has had negative consequences for genetic connectivity in the superb fairy-wren, we used a landscape-scale approach to compare patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow at large (landscape/regional) and fine (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, using genetic distances, for each sex, we tested landscape models of decreased dispersal through treeless areas (isolation-by-resistance) while controlling for the effect of isolation-by-distance. Landscape models indicated that larger-scale gene flow across the Box-Ironbark region was constrained by distance rather than by lack of structural connectivity. Nonetheless, a pattern of isolation-by-resistance for males (the less-dispersive sex) and lower genetic diversity and higher genetic similarity within sites in low-cover fragmented landscapes indicated disruption to fine-scale gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems. Although loss of structural connectivity did not appear to impede gene flow at larger spatial scales, fragmentation appeared to affect fine-scale population processes (e.g. local gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems) adversely and may contribute to the decline of superb fairy-wrens in fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark region.",10.1111/1365-2656.12007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873991625&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2656.12007&partnerID=40&md5=daee2322bc1f8d505a1b2b34259a67ae,82,7,disrupted fine-scale population processes in fragmented landscapes despite large-scale genetic connectivity for a widespread and common cooperative breeder: the superb fairy-wren (malurus cyaneus),10.1111/1365-2656.12007,http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30051580/harrison-disruptedfinescale-2012.pdf; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2656.12007; https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12007; http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30051580; https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/disrupted-fine-scale-population-processes-in-fragmented-landscape; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23190389; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12007; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23190389; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12007/abstract; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12007%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2656.MOLECOL_JANE; http://core.ac.uk/display/14003298; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12007; http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30051580

The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.",10.1196/annals.1319.017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3242685041&doi=10.1196%2fannals.1319.017&partnerID=40&md5=5f19d3b170d5478473cd548838da1cd6,1023,11,"the dynamics of social-ecological systems in urban landscapes - stockholm and the national urban park, sweden",10.1196/annals.1319.017,NA; unknown; html; unknown; html; html; html; html; html; unknown; html

Upon the new concepts and measurement of linear landscape diversity and cellular landscape diversity, we proposed greenway potential index incorporating land suitability and landscape diversity. The greenway potential index was combined with connectivity analysis to connect path between a future greenway's origin and destination that meets both land suitability and landscape diversity requirements. Specially, with Wuchang (Wuhan City, China) as a case study area, we proposed three greenway alignment planning scenarios respectively according to the criteria of suitability, diversity and the synthesis of them. Markedly differences were revealed between the results of suitability greenways and diversity greenways.

Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (<15 ha) contribute significantly to overall connectivity, which may have implications for future conservation efforts. In Lisbon, connectivity (342 ha) is concentrated within patches. We also applied the improved Indicator 2 to a case study in southwestern Montreal, where a greenway network (""green infrastructure"") has been proposed by a local community organization. We assessed the contribution of Meadowbrook Golf Course to connectivity in scenarios of the proposed greenway network and the effect that residential development would have. Not only would this development eliminate the golf course's current contribution to connectivity, but also its much greater potential contribution to connectivity in future scenarios. Restoring and establishing additional natural areas would significantly increase connectivity in the network. Our results demonstrate that the improved version of Indicator 2 is a suitable method in the CBI. It is equally useful for identifying options to increase the connectivity of natural areas within cities in the future and for determining the impacts of urban development on connectivity. More advanced methods for quantifying connectivity exist and may also be included in Part I of the CBI. However, they are often challenging to use and this frequently discourages city planners from including any indicator of connectivity in their biodiversity monitoring. The connectivity metric presented here overcomes this problem through its practicality in a wide range of planning structures while still generating meaningful results which may then inspire city planners to move towards using more advanced methods of measuring connectivity.

We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts.

Analysis of residence type of birds showed that passengers were the most prevalent (37%), indicating that Beijing is a major node in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Park size was crucial for total species abundance, but foliage height diversity was the most important factor influencing avian species diversity. Thus, optimizing the configuration of vertical vegetation structure in certain park areas is critical for supporting avian communities in urban parks. Human visitation also showed negative impact on species diversity.

Our results show that, bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments.

The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. Tn general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation, In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation. A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural).

This study was designed to characterize the spatial pattern of green spaces and the extent of changes driven by the urbanization along the urban-rural gradient using a combination of landscape metrics and floristic plots. Our results revealed that the number of patches was directly proportional to the degree of urbanization of the city, whereas the area of the green spaces and the index of the largest patch showed an inverse relationship with the urbanization degree. Urban green spaces were dominated by attached and roadside spaces that are more equipped and present a higher occurrence of cultivated plants. By contrast, peri-urban green spaces were characterized by buffer zones, fields, abandoned areas, and informal spaces, with an elevated proportion of invasive species and natural vegetation. Moreover, it was found that the number of exotic species increased with the degree of urbanization, reaching values considered a threat to the indigenous flora.

Although gene flow among fragmented populations has been investigated for many species, there has been little research into the effects of urbanisation on gene flow in large mammals. Singapore is a small, densely urbanised tropical city-state where more than 99% of its original forest has been cleared. The wild pig is currently the largest native terrestrial mammal in Singapore and has important roles in maintaining plant diversity and seed dispersal. Pigs are widespread and present in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) as well as other forest patches in Singapore. Due to the extent of urbanisation, it is unclear if genetic connectivity exists between the CCNR and other forest fragments. In this study, genome libraries from 48 samples of pig blood were collected from two sites: 1) the CCNR and 2) forest fragments in the northeast of Singapore. Genome-wide SNP loci were used to understand the population genomics of the two pig populations. The results indicated that the pig populations formed two distinct genetic clusters that did not align with the respective sites. Both sites included individuals with signatures from both genetic clusters, although with different frequencies. This suggests that pigs can move across heavily urbanised landscapes. Future studies should involve long term collaring studies to identify specific corridors used by the pigs for dispersal, and a larger population genomic assessment to understand pig dispersal and gene flow to and from forest patches other than the CCNR and the Northeast.",10.26107/RBZ-2019-0002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065889684&doi=10.26107%2fRBZ-2019-0002&partnerID=40&md5=19a582a11a9473eb01ffa19df6d52fbc,67,4,evidence of genetic connectivity between fragmented pig populations in a tropical urban city-state,10.26107/RBZ-2019-0002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065889684&doi=10.26107%2fRBZ-2019-0002&partnerID=40&md5=19a582a11a9473eb01ffa19df6d52fbc

It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (F-ST=0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations.

Within the urban habitat, the PD of birds reduces as impervious area and noise levels increase, while in the urban cells with most forested areas reach the highest PD values.

Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics.

Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments. In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types.

An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration.

The land use type FOR presented the highest alpha and beta diversity, with a high number of native species occurring only in areas defined by this land use. The results indicate that the category FOR plays an important role in the conservation of regional flora and is a possible source of germplasm for restoration programs in sites degraded by human disturbance.

In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied.

Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line.

The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.",10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,19,4,dispersal-related traits of the snail cornu aspersum along an urbanisation gradient: maintenance of mobility across life stages despite high costs,10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y

Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs. 2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary. 3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it. 4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate. 5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency. 6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes.

Drawing on a sample of 199 nature-based solutions across Europe, we identify how cities work with nature-based solutions to conserve nature, restore nature, and to find ways to thrive through harnessing nature's contribution to people. Our findings show that cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature-based solutions, and often adopt specific and quantifiable targets to guide their actions. Yet there is significant variation in the ways in which biodiversity goals and interventions are being pursued. Where biodiversity goals and actions are included in nature-based solutions, they are mainly ecosystem-based - focusing on the protection, restoration or enhancement of the integrity, functionality, and connectivity of habitats and ecosystems - with fewer focused on specific species, and very few projects concerned with genetic diversity. Although it is often assumed that urban action towards biodiversity goals will be undertaken through local planning processes, our analysis shows that European cities are taking project-based actions for biodiversity through a set of explicit, quantitative and measurable targets, which are tailored to the specific conditions of urban settings. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that if cities are to achieve ambitious goals for biodiversity over the next decade, new international frameworks being developed for the post-2020 period should include targets that acknowledge the way in which biodiversity is governed in cities and the contribution that cities make to conserve, restore and thrive with nature to guide urban action.",10.1016/j.envsci.2020.04.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084547621&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2020.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=1a49553a27c56725976dae5278ad2d2e,110,2,nature-based solutions for urban biodiversity governance,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.04.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901119314480; https://dro.dur.ac.uk/30804/

We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai.

A total of 48 species including 2,599 individual birds were recorded; the majority of which (>80%) were species of open habitat. Generalized linear mixed model indicated that the area of green cover had the strongest influence on number of individuals. Specifically, the abundance of individuals was increased by the presence of river corridors and roadside reserves. Areas located further away from water bodies and with less green cover had fewer birds. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a varied landscape matrix into urban planning so as to maintain urban bird diversity and demonstrate the usefulness of citizen science in biodiversity monitoring.

These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.",10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019858331&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-017-9992-0&partnerID=40&md5=8097597afb461bfec8a361246ebd0160,21,3,the role of small secondary biotopes in a highly fragmented landscape as habitat and connectivity providers for dragonflies (insecta: odonata),10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0

As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Location England, UK. Time period 1990-2018. Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants. Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity. Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa.

The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands.

Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland. (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning.

This study investigated how host natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban rural interface. 3. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected. 4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable. 5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban rural interface can also have an effect on host natural enemy communities.

In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory.

Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.",10.1016/0169-2046(93)90109-Q,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027884327&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2893%2990109-Q&partnerID=40&md5=a5ce01637599a703edd86a5bd6616c86,23,1,"the avian population of an urban bushland reserve at wollongong, new-south-wales - implications for management",10.1016/0169-2046(93)90109-Q,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027884327&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2893%2990109-Q&partnerID=40&md5=a5ce01637599a703edd86a5bd6616c86

Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0.99 km(2)), Michigan (mean = 1.34 km(2)), Nebraska (mean = 1.20 km(2)), and Wisconsin (mean = 1.47 km(2)) did not differ across the region (F (3,175) = 0.42, P = 0.737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape.

We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.",10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/17982/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-020-00978-4.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/241802809/vegetated-roofs-in-boreal-climate-support-mobile-open-habitat-arthropods-with,23,8,"vegetated roofs in boreal climate support mobile open habitat arthropods, with differentiation between meadow and succulent roofs",10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/17982/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-020-00978-4.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/241802809/vegetated-roofs-in-boreal-climate-support-mobile-open-habitat-arthropods-with

We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all combinations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model.

Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment. Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units. In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality. The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard.

The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.",10.1071/WR19076,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095133822&doi=10.1071%2fWR19076&partnerID=40&md5=c5ffcb5d9d6208e09b88b83a02575933,48,9,regional variation in habitat matrix determines movement metrics in baudin's cockatoos in southwest western australia,10.1071/WR19076,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095133822&doi=10.1071%2fWR19076&partnerID=40&md5=c5ffcb5d9d6208e09b88b83a02575933

Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.",10.1603/022.038.0509,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/biosci_pubs/961/; https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/38/5/1411/407854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825296; https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.short; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103029900.html; http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/5/1411; https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103029900; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19825296,38,4,habitat-specific movement and edge-mediated behavior of the saproxylic insect odontotaenius disjunctus (coleoptera: passalidae),10.1603/022.038.0509,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/biosci_pubs/961/; https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/38/5/1411/407854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825296; https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.short; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103029900.html; http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/5/1411; https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103029900; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19825296

They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities.

Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix. We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision. We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance. When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit. Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes.

We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway.

Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies.

The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages.

The isolating nature of catchment boundaries over evolutionary timescales makes them potentially important in defining natural units for biodiversity management. We sought to clarify biogeographical relationships amongst drainages within Australia's biodiverse mid-eastern coastal region (Fitzroy, Burnett, and Mary Catchments) where freshwater communities face considerable urban pressure, using a locally endemic riverine specialist, the white-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula. Mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite data sets were employed to investigate past and present influences on population connectivity and to identify units for management. Populations within catchments were largely well connected genetically. However, the Fitzroy Catchment contained a distinct genetic lineage, deeply divergent from a second lineage present across the Burnett and Mary Catchments. The two lineages can be considered evolutionarily significant units that reflect historical isolation of the Fitzroy and recent coalescence of the Burnett-Mary Catchments during lowered Pleistocene sea levels. Congruence with geological evidence and patterns reported for fish and macroinvertebrates supports a shared biogeographical history of a diverse regional biota.

Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively).

However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods.

Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations. The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei. Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment. This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.",10.1002/aqc.3324,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082051137&doi=10.1002%2faqc.3324&partnerID=40&md5=626030bf8b7f6c7f4129c123c977ebc7,30,4,land use surrounding wetlands influences urban populations of a freshwater turtle,10.1002/aqc.3324,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/55271/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aqc.3324

Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation.

Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic.

Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (n = 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2 h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations.

The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority.

Some are limited to a short period and pass by, others are of a permanent nature. Often these two kinds of disturbances occur simultaneously. This makes it difficult to disentangle the specific behavioural response to each disturbance. As species may respond to different disturbances in different ways, it is important to know the species-specific and disturbance-specific responses to develop effective species conservation action. We investigated the behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Berlin to temporary disturbance (in the form of an open-air music festival) and permanent disturbance (in the form of habitat fragmentation). We show that a music festival is a major stressor that strongly influences all investigated behaviours. Urban hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area showed subtle behavioural changes compared to those in low-fragmented areas, suggesting that fragmentation was a moderate challenge which they could cope with. Thus, the temporary disturbance by a music festival had a more serious impact on hedgehog behaviour than permanent disturbance caused by fragmentation. Moreover, we show that males responded stronger to the transient disturbance and females responded stronger to habitat fragmentation. Anthropogenic activities can result in both transient and permanent changes in the environment. We studied spatial and temporal behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) to a transient (open-air music festival) and a permanent (highly fragmented area) disturbance in the city of Berlin, Germany. Activity, foraging and movement patterns were observed in two distinct areas in 2016 and 2017 using a ""Before & After"" and ""Control & Impact"" study design. Confronted with a music festival, hedgehogs substantially changed their movement behaviour and nesting patterns and decreased the rhythmic synchronization (DFC) of their activity patterns with the environment. These findings suggest that a music festival is a substantial stressor influencing the trade-off between foraging and risk avoidance. Hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area used larger home ranges and moved faster than in low-fragmented and low-disturbed areas. They also showed behaviours and high DFCs similar to individuals in low-fragmented, low disturbed environment, suggesting that fragmentation posed a moderate challenge which they could accommodate. The acute but transient disturbance of a music festival, therefore, had more substantial and severe behavioural effects than the permanent disturbance through fragmentation.

We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat.",10.5751/ES-02993-140213,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73849125969&doi=10.5751%2fES-02993-140213&partnerID=40&md5=8f1ac2f3ccdcc79ee5dfa3b4b1727ab1,14,2,can road-crossing structures improve population viability of an urban gliding mammal?,10.5751/ES-02993-140213,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73849125969&doi=10.5751%2fES-02993-140213&partnerID=40&md5=8f1ac2f3ccdcc79ee5dfa3b4b1727ab1

Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among ""Greater Wildland Ecosystems."" Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales.

It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions.

In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1-7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation.

In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves.

Menelaides is speciose and intensively sampled, with nearly 260 years of systematic study complicated by polytypy resulting from discontinuous morphological variation. This variation is structured by the mainland-island matrix of the geologically complex Indo-Australian Region, where drawing species boundaries has been difficult. We sampled variation across the biogeographic range of Menelaides, covering 97% of currently recognized species and nearly half of all subspecies. We generated a well-supported mito-nuclear phylogeny, on which we delineated species based on two species delimitation methods (GMYC and mPTP) and strongly supported reciprocal monophyly. These analyses showed that the true species diversity in this group may be up to 25% greater than traditional taxonomy suggests, and prompts extensive taxonomic restructuring. Biogeographic analyses showed that Menelaides have diversified largely in allopatry in Indo-Australian subregions by repeated dispersals across key biogeographic barriers. These results provide critical insights into the diversification process in this morphologically diverse and taxonomically complicated model group.

These hypotheses state that urban avifaunal communities are less diverse, with greater representation by generalists, but that certain mangrove specialists can utilize urban landscapes. Much of this is said to be driven by food resources, with frugivores and nectarivores benefiting from abundant residential flowers and fruits, while insectivores are driven away by low food resources. This study used passive acoustic monitoring to identify the audible anuran and avifaunal species in mangroves across the urban gradient of Puerto Rico. Three anurans and twenty-four avian species were detected across all sites, with eighteen species found at the most diverse site, and six at the least diverse site. The most urban communities were more similar to each other and characterized by low diversity, especially of invertivores, mangrove specialists, and endemics. The least urban communities, however, were less like each other and more diverse than their more urban counterparts. Greater surrounding vegetation cover was the strongest overall predictor of increased faunal diversity, although urban coverage and population density were also strongly correlated with some guilds and species. Soundscape analyses showed that acoustic space use was a strong predictor of site diversity and is thus a sufficiently accurate faster alternative to detecting individual species.

In general, population declines of the magnitudes now detected should lead to reduced effective population sizes for animals living in proximity to humans and disturbed lands. This is cause for concern because effective population sizes set the rate of genetic diversity loss due to genetic drift, the rate of increase in inbreeding, and the efficiency with which selection can act on beneficial alleles. We predicted that the effects of urbanization should decrease effective population size and genetic diversity, and increase population-level genetic differentiation. To test for such patterns, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived genetic data sets for North American birds and mammals. After filtering, we had usable raw genotype data from 85 studies and 41,023 individuals, sampled from 1,008 locations spanning 41 mammal and 25 bird species. We used census-based urban-rural designations, human population density, and the Human Footprint Index as measures of urbanization and habitat disturbance. As predicted, mammals sampled in more disturbed environments had lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and were more genetically differentiated from those in more natural environments.

This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality.

We used an original combination of habitat and dispersal data to revisit these predictions under various climatic scenarios. We used the future range of suitable habitat, predicted with habitat variables only, as a base layer to further predict the range or reachable habitat by accounting for both dispersal ability and landscape connectivity. Our results confirm the northward shift in range and indicate that the area of co-occurrences should also increase. However, reachable habitat should expand less than suitable habitat, especially when accounting for landscape connectivity. In addition, the potential range expansion was further limited for the red-listed D. plantarius, which is more habitat-specialist and has a lower ability to disperse.

Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface - the “catscape” - that potential prey have to navigate. There were almost no gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 meters to their owner’s home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats.

However, it is not well understood whether these effects are generally applicable across taxa. Here, we repurposed and synthesized raw microsatellite data from online repositories from 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 sites in North America.

Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density and the Human Footprint Index, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found no consistent relationships for any of our genetic metrics. While we did not detect directional effects for most species, a few generalist species responded positively to urbanization. These results contrast with consistent negative effects of urbanization in mammals and species specific positive and negative effects in birds.

Studies investigating the role of urbanization in altering these ecological parameters have mostly focused on avian communities or plant species, while arthropods such as spiders which are integral components of urban households have largely been overlooked. This study aims to understand the impact of urbanization on both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of spider assemblages across an urban–semi-urban–forest gradient in Guwahati, a rapidly growing city in northeast India. We surveyed spiders at 13 sites representing four habitat types (urban, urban parks, semi-urban, and forests) using belt transects, and also recorded functional traits relating to key life history processes. Spider species composition differed significantly between various habitats. The taxonomic diversity of spiders was highest in forests and lowest in urban parks. The turnover component was the major contributor to changing the β-diversity of spiders. Reduced diversity in urban regions was likely due to the dominance of a few synanthropic species. Generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the habitat types significantly impacted spider abundance. Functional richness was maximum in forests (Fric = 23.43) and minimum in urban habitats (Fric = 12.98), while functional divergence was maximum in urban sites (Fdiv = 0.79).

With the development of statistical tools to quantify and partially isolate the role of each of these processes, empirical metacommunity studies have multiplied worldwide. However, few works attempt a multi-taxon approach and even fewer compare two distant biogeographical regions using the same methodology. Under this framework, we tested the expectation that temperate (mediterranean-climate) pond metacommunities would be more influenced by environmental and spatial processes than tropical ones, because of stronger environmental gradients and greater isolation of waterbodies.We surveyed 30 tropical and 32 mediterranean temporary ponds from Costa Rica and Spain, respectively, and obtained data on 49 environmental variables (including limnological, hydrogeomorphological, biotic, climatic, and landscape variables). We characterized the biological communities of Bacteria and Archaea (from both the water column and the sediments), phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, amphibians and birds, and estimated the relative role of space and environment on metacommunity organization for each group and region, by means of variation partitioning using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).Environmental selection was important in both tropical and mediterranean ponds, but markedly stronger in the latter, probably due to their larger limnological heterogeneity. Spatialized environment and pure spatial effects were greater in the tropics, related to higher climatic heterogeneity and dispersal processes (e.g. restriction, surplus) acting at different scales. The variability between taxonomic groups in spatial and environmental contributions was very wide. Effects on passive and active dispersers were similar within regions but different across regions, with higher environmental effects in mediterranean active dispersers. The residual (unexplained) variation was larger in tropical pond metacommunities, suggesting a higher role for stochastic processes and/or effects of biotic interactions in the tropics.

This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
