We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.",10.1016/j.ufug.2016.06.024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978998628&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2016.06.024&partnerID=40&md5=50ebdd8c7513ea006e07ef10be00d1df,19,6,urban permeability for birds: an approach combining mobbing-call experiments and circuit theory,10.1016/j.ufug.2016.06.024,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5247302; https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/71426/1/Urban%20For.%20Urban%20Green.19_167-175.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866715301291; https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2115/71426; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866715301291; https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120006502482

We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500-m scale and patch isolation at the 100-m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro-ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss.",10.1111/gcb.12825,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924626442&doi=10.1111%2fgcb.12825&partnerID=40&md5=e6d1410a99be56abd68bf2d2b2bed2ae,21,2,a landscape ecology approach identifies important drivers of urban biodiversity,10.1111/gcb.12825,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/25620599; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12825/abstract; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015GCBio..21.1652T/abstract; https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12825; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25620599/

Loss of genome-wide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genome-wide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genome-wide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10,000 SNP markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genome-wide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genome-wide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations.

Here, in order to find the potentials of improvements in ecological connectivity, we provide a spatial analysis to present differences in ecological connectivity based on land cover maps and urban habitat maps in Suwon city, Republic of Korea. We generated two permeability maps for use in a network analysis, one being land cover and the other urban habitat, including a 5-km buffer area from the city boundary. We then determined the current-flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) for each map. Our results indicate that forests are typically the most highly connected areas in both maps. However, in the land cover map results, nearly all high-priority areas were in the mountainous region (CFBC value: 0.0100 ± 0.0028), but the urban habitat indicated that grasslands and rivers within the city also significantly contribute to connectivity (CFBC value: 0.0071 ± 0.0022).

In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5–20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure – through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity – but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.",10.1007/s11252-014-0433-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939654773&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-014-0433-5&partnerID=40&md5=94c858a2649f36465070ee069971c5c9,18,4,"effects of habitat structure, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity on urban forest bird communities",10.1007/s11252-014-0433-5,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/4400128; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-014-0433-5; https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chan_Ryul_Park/publication/271843506_Effects_of_habitat_structure_human_disturbance_and_habitat_connectivity_on_urban_forest_bird_communities/links/5540b4570cf2718618da81bd.pdf

Recent policies have acknowledged the value of urban green areas in counterbalancing such impacts. These policies aim to increase the ecological value of green areas, making cities more permeable to natural populations. However, they are largely focused on the role and management of public green areas, ignoring the role and potential of private green areas for urban ecological value.This study aims to evaluate the benefits of considering private green areas for conservation efforts in cities. Using data on bat activity and information on vegetation and building height, we quantify the respective role of public and private green areas in habitat availability and connectivity for the common pipistrelle in the city of Paris, France. Our results show that despite the low proportion of private green areas in Paris (36% of the total green areas), they still contributed up to 47.9% of bat habitat availability and decrease the resistance of the city matrix by 88%. The distribution in the city matrix and vegetation composition of those areas appeared especially beneficial for bat habitat availability and connectivity. The study demonstrates the importance of private green areas in the ecological value of cities in complementing the role of public green areas.

The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation.

However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.",10.1890/13-0705.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904093237&doi=10.1890%2f13-0705.1&partnerID=40&md5=9ad6a6c0ac1df4a2388fa3752daff538,95,4,habitat connectivity shapes urban arthropod communities: the key role of green roofs,10.1890/13-0705.1,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/mapping/view/pub:132026; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24933819; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0705.1/abstract; http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-0705.1; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0705.1/abstract; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24933819/; https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/wsl/islandora/object/wsl:4891; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0705.1; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0705.1/full; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/13-0705.1; http://www.wsl.ch/wsl/info/mitarbeitende/obrist/pdf/13628.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933819; https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/wsl/islandora/object/wsl%3A4891/datastream/PDF/view; http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/13-0705.1?af=R

While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of “urban-adapted” species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the influence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning significantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes.

We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9% independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p < 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area <500 m2. Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density.

The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5 km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks' relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity.

This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. ‘current’), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance. Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data. Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised. Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly.

Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, traffic or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene flow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene flow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene flow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence-absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe.",10.1111/mec.13810,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027948686&doi=10.1111%2fmec.13810&partnerID=40&md5=28fe757327936751349cf4c54fd93097,25,7,cityscape genetics: structural vs. functional connectivity of an urban lizard population,10.1111/mec.13810,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27543765; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543765; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13810/full

To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this study takes Aksu City and Wensu County, important cities and towns in southern Xinjiang, as examples, focusing on the impact of human activities on the distribution of critical ecological protection areas. First, we simulated the range, intensity, and local natural conditions of human activities in the study area using geospatial data. We created corresponding resistance surfaces (human activity resistance surface and natural landscape resistance surface). We then assign different weights to the two resistance surfaces based on several possible scenarios, resulting in different synthetic resistance surfaces. Finally, we used the Linkage Mapper plugin to identify critical ecological reserves and compared several results. The results show that: Human activities have greatly interfered with the migration and dispersal of species, affecting the distribution of critical ecological reserves. The specific performance is that in the urban center area with high intensity of human activities, the number and location of the surrounding ecological corridors change significantly with the increase in the proportion of human activity resistance and the total area remains unchanged; As part of the ecological corridors, the ecological pinch points changes with the location of the corridor, and the whole area remains unchanged; The threshold range of the restoration value of ecological barrier points is reduced.

Thus, an urban ecological network is essential to support their PAs. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the PAs connectivity in an urban landscape in Brazil and understanding whether urban forest fragments can support an urban ecological network. Besides spatial models based on functional connectivity and graph theory, we used participatory techniques to design the resistance surface and the least-cost paths (LCPs) for Atlantic Forest birds. The results showed critical paths (LCPs), important areas for restoration programs for improving PAs connectivity, and essential forest fragments for conservation and restoration. Although the landscape has a forest structure with 1873 forest fragments and 516 links through which the LCPs were structured, most forest fragments and LCPs cannot provide the necessary support for the PAs connectivity. The current ecological network is dependent on forest fragments neighboring (outside PAs) and the flux dispersions occurred mainly in the peri-urban areas. Riparian zones and anthropic grasslands also showed importance for the PAs connectivity. We identified only 28 forest fragments spatially connected, pre-senting several sizes, and located near large forest areas, relevant PAs, and riparian zones. Six of these forest fragments, smaller than ten hectares and strategically located in the urban matrix, were indicated for restoration actions.

Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links.

But the potential effect of landscape configuration on biodiversity’s response to intensification has rarely been considered; besides, studies have often taken yield as an indicator of agricultural management and have generalized conclusions from studying particular taxonomic groups.

In particular, we study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined gradient in matrix quality and configurational heterogeneity of habitat patches, and considering community dynamics. We found that species richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape heterogeneity increases, as stricter survival thresholds are applied to species or as habitat area is reduced.

In this study, a series of graph-based connectivity indices was calculated to 1) evaluate the optimal threshold distance, 2) identify the key landscape units at the component and patch levels, and 3) classify the functional types of components and patches and analyze functional patterns at different structural levels. The relationship between patch size and patch functional performance in maintaining landscape connectivity was discussed. With a natural forest area in Minqing County of China as the study area, recommendations regarding forest conservation and connectivity enhancement were provided based on the research conclusions. This study provides a way to comprehensively analyze habitat fragmentation and functional patterns for local forest conservation.

Within this context, improving the permeability of urban landscapes is expected to be an effective strategy to facilitate the process of forest migration through cities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to assess the permeability of urban green spaces as stepping stones for forest migration, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Design/methodology/approach The proposed method combines a least-cost path (LCP) model and a graph theory-based approach. The LCP model is applied to map the potential pathways of seed dispersal at multiple spatial and temporal scales, based on which graph theory-based indices are used to quantify the accessibility of urban landscapes for seed dispersers. This method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. Eurasian jay, Eurasian siskin, coal tit and grey squirrel are selected as the main seed dispersers in the study area. Findings The results provide a comparison of the landscape permeability maps generated from different seed dispersers and identify key areas likely to facilitate the process of forest migration. Recommendations regarding landscape management for improving permeability are also discussed. Originality/value This method allows designers to re-visualise highly modified and fragmented urban landscapes as stepping stones for seed dispersal, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to optimise urban landscapes for climate adaptation.",10.1108/SASBE-12-2018-0065,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067055513&doi=10.1108%2fSASBE-12-2018-0065&partnerID=40&md5=aee99f1509decc2ce62a341460d4c09c,9,2,stepping stones assessing the permeability of urban greenspaces to climate-driven migration of trees,10.1108/SASBE-12-2018-0065,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067055513&doi=10.1108%2fSASBE-12-2018-0065&partnerID=40&md5=aee99f1509decc2ce62a341460d4c09c

In this study, we performed a graph-theoretical analysis to identify the relationship between nest distribution of the black-billed magpie Pica pica sericea and well-connected habitat patches. We analyzed 134 nest sites to determine environmental variables important for nesting magpies and identify habitat patches using a logistic model. Connectivity was estimated by Euclidean distance between habitat patches. A randomization procedure was implemented to verify the association between the nest distribution and the degree of habitat connectivity measured at multiple spatial scales. Preferred nesting habitat was areas close to the forest edge, containing more forest cover within 30 m of the nest. Connectivity analysis showed that the nest location was highly related to large clusters of habitat patches when patches are connected at large spatial scales. In addition, the nests in forest patches were close to grass patches with high connectivity. However, the size of habitat clusters adjacent to nests was much smaller than the average size of total habitat clusters across most scales, indicating that there are anthropogenic factors (e.g., effect of supplementary food in an urban matrix) affecting the distribution of magpie nests. Our results suggest that the distribution of magpie nests is related to landscape connectivity, which can be more clearly explained by taking into account the anthropogenic factors.

The persistence of species in these small, sometimes ephemeral, aquatic habitats depends on the dispersal of individuals among ponds in the landscape. However, the number of ponds across the landscape is at a historical low as urbanisation and intensified agricultural practices have led to a substantial loss of ponds (nodes in the pond network) over more than a century. Here, we examine the extent and drivers of pond loss in a heavily urbanised landscape (Birmingham, UK) over 105 years and determine how pond loss influences key structural properties of the pond network using graph theoretic approaches. Specifically, we calculated minimum spanning trees (MST) and performed percolation analyses to determine changes in both the spatial configuration and resilience of the pond network through time. Pond numbers declined by 82% between ca1904 and 2009, such that pond density decreased from 7.1 km(-2) to 1.3 km(-2). The MST analyses revealed increased distance between ponds in the network (i.e. edge length increased) by up to 49% over the 105-year period, indicating that ponds in the modern landscape (2009) were considerably more isolated, with fewer neighbours.

In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity.

The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria.

While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Munster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement.

We studied a 500km(2) Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental-shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic releves, we built species-area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental-shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near-shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor.

The modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden. The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as stepping stones and barriers were accounted for. Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land cover types are important.

We used a graph-theoretic approach to model structural and functional connectivity for a widespread but declining pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). This involved assessing species movement among breeding ponds and associated landscapes with different levels of urban and rural development and linear barriers. We used recent regional pond survey data for great crested newts combined with published data on movement and habitat use to explore connectivity. Landscape connectivity was affected by factors such as habitat quality and quantity, scale of movement and different degrees of road permeability. Linear barriers to movement and differences in their permeability were critical for predicting their impact on both migratory and dispersal movements in Triturus cristatus. Incorporating landscape connectivity modelling which includes the impact of barriers such as roads would substantially improve population-level outcomes from mitigation schemes.

To solve this problem, a multi-scale index system was constructed to identify ecological sources comprehensively. The minimum-cost path method, the circuit theory, and the cyclic window search method were adopted to quantitatively identify the important ecological sources and corridors in scale nesting and pinch points and barrier points that affect multi-level connectivity. Furthermore, the specific optimization layout strategy of the ecological network structure of the Hefei metropolitan area was proposed. According to the results, if ecological sources and corridors at two scales are overlaid, the coincident area of ecological sources at two scales is 1719.95 km2. As important ecological sources, Chaohu Lake Basin, Niuwangzhai, and Wuding Mountain, which are important areas to maintain the ecological network, need to be protected. Ten overlapping ecological corridors, which are mainly distributed in Changfeng County, are easily damaged long term. As a result, ecological nodes should be set up as temporary habitats for species transfer. In addition, based on the circuit theory and the cyclic window search method, calculating areas of pinch points at two scales yields 1637.75 km2 and 434.22 km2, respectively, and for areas of barrier points yields 2182.75 km2 and 126.97 km2, respectively. The ecological pinch points at two overlapping scales among them are important areas for future protection. Due to the small and fragmented spatial distribution in the urban area, pinch points with an average size of 0.58 km2 are easy to be restored and will greatly improve the connectivity of the ecological network after restoration. Furthermore, through the quantitative identification of ecological network elements of two scales, the paper puts forward an optimization strategy for an ecological network in the Hefei metropolitan area from three aspects of “point-line-polygon.” The research results can reference decision-making concerning the delineation of urban growth boundary, regional ecological security pattern, land space renovation, and ecosystem restoration.",10/grsk86,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2530130515?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=%2BkrXsR3%2BrGimgx94uTyH87Cl75U%3D,13,7,construction of ecological network based on multi-scale conversion and nesting,10/grsk86,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2530130515?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=%2BkrXsR3%2BrGimgx94uTyH87Cl75U%3D

Green and ecological networks have been developed as an attempt to maintain the functioning of landscapes, promote the sustainable use and conservation of nature, support the movement of species and increase people's use and enjoyment of the nature (Bennett and Wit, 2001; Bennett and Mulongoy, 2006; Lawton et al., 2010). These can be achieved by the identification and selection of the main features of ecological and green networks based on ecological and / or social functions we intend them to fulfil as well as the determination of objective conservation measures. The main purpose of this research is to focus on critically examining different ways of defining green and ecological networks and their functionality for biodiversity and people in the case of Sheffield, which were derived from different theoretical and professional perspectives (planning and ecology), and to explore the potential for different approaches to define ecological / green networks. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this thesis uses a mixed research methodology, based on different methods of data collection and analysis. This research commences with the analysis of existing green and ecological network approaches, namely the Green Network (Sheffield City Council) and the Living Don (Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust). In order to analyse these approaches, policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and ArcGIS spatial analyses were conducted to understand the rationale, aims and the spatial structure of current networks in the case of Sheffield. For the identification of criteria to develop alternative routes of connectivity, ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS were used. After generating land cover and land use maps at a very fine scale (2m raster resolution) and with different levels of detail, the alternative connectivity routes, for both biodiversity and people, were identified on the basis of two connectivity measures. The first set of spatial analyses took into account structural connectivity of landscape components as the main criteria, to develop potential routes using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS in combination. On the other hand, based on functional connectivity, the second set of alternative connectivity routes were developed using a least-cost corridor approach in ArcGIS. For the delineation of alternative connectivity routes for biodiversity, 10 species were selected from 3 different taxon groups (birds, mammals and reptiles); and for people, the alternative routes from residential buildings to (a) green and open spaces, (b) public buildings and (c) industrial / commercial units were used considering the effects of physical / legal accessibility and slope. Then, existing approaches and derived alternative routes of connectivity were compared and contrasted to each other in ArcGIS, to analyse the relationship between their structural properties and the urban morphologies in which they occur, with a view to predicting the implications for ecological connectivity and use by members of the public. The Sheffield City Council and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust aim at maintaining and enhancing ecological connectivity for the benefit of wildlife as well as supporting public enjoyment and movement, and both of their network approaches benefit from the linear connectivity formed around the main rivers, streams and valleys. However, it was found that there are significant differences in the representation, spatial coverage and arrangement of the Green Network and the Living Don based on the methods and the site selection criteria used for developing green and ecological networks. Regarding the structural connectivity routes for biodiversity and people, significant differences were found in the spatial extent and arrangement of alternative routes. On the other hand, functional connectivity routes for biodiversity showed both similarities and differences in their spatial extents and arrangements according to selected species' habitat requirements and movement behaviours across the landscape. Similarly, functional connectivity routes for people changed as I used different destinations and parameters. The overall results of this research provide further support for the conceptual premise that the definition of green and ecological networks is highly dependent on the methodology, ecological and / or social functions that are considered, and also criteria for the inclusion of different habitats or land uses within the network.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1807095279?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=vxz6FY0Bj1gJu016kpsdgyGoSpQ%3D,NA,1,"an integrated approach to enhancing ecological connectivity and accessibility in urban areas: a case study of sheffield, uk",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1807095279?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=vxz6FY0Bj1gJu016kpsdgyGoSpQ%3D

Further, it remains unclear whether species exhibit parallel responses to independent landscapes. Commensal rodents are widely distributed within cities and around the world, offering a useful model for understanding the influence of cities on gene flow, genetic drift, and habitat distribution. Here I study the population genetics and landscape ecology of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in four urban landscapes, New York City (NYC), New Orleans (NOL), Salvador (SAL), Vancouver (VAN), using genome-wide SNPs to understand the influence of urban landscapes on eco-evolutionary processes governing their distribution and functional connectivity.Rat populations in each city exhibited significant genetic discontinuities that coincide with landscape features, despite widespread isolation-by-distance processes. Genetic variation in NYC and SAL rats was clinal, but I identified genetic clusters separated by areas with lower genetic diversity and reduced migration. Rats in NOL and SAL exhibited stark genetic structure that coincided with a canal and major roadways, respectively. I identified spatially restricted dispersal in all populations leading to parallel decays in spatial autocorrelation with increased distance. Habitat suitability modeling revealed a consistent response of rat distribution to human population density, income, and building characteristics. Landscape genetic modeling indicated that models incorporating features of the built physical environment consistently predict gene flow processes, though unique landscape effects were identified in each city, particularly at local spatial scales. Further, I found that habitat suitability and genetic connectivity were uncoupled (i.e., driven by different factors) and habitat is rarely the best predictor of gene flow for urban rats. My results demonstrate the utility of multi-landscape studies in identifying generalized trends across populations, with implications for the management of invasive pest populations.

Habitat alteration can have severe consequences for native species that remain in previously undisturbed areas. Urban development has shown to reduce abundance and density of populations and create barriers to gene flow for stream salamanders in urban areas. Although they are still relatively common and abundant through the Northeast, Northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) populations are declining in urban habitats including in New York City. In this study, I explored genetic structure of E. bislineata across an urban, suburban and rural habitat to better understand how urbanization is affecting genetic connectivity between headwater streams. Next, I investigated what environmental and/or urban features influence gene flow patterns in E. bislineata across these same three habitats using landscape genetic methods. Lastly, I used environmental DNA monitoring with metabarcoding techniques to explore stream salamander presence on an urban-to-rural gradient and to investigate overall vertebrate species richness differences to further understand how urban development may be affecting biodiversity in urban aquatic ecosystems.E. bislineata within the urban habitat had greater genetic structure, yet exhibited comparable genetic diversity levels to individuals in the suburban and rural habitat. A mixture of terrestrial variables influence gene flow in the urban habitat, percent canopy cover is most influential for gene flow in the suburban habitat, and variation in aquatic variables affects gene flow patterns for rural stream salamanders. Urbanization factors were identified as the second most important features affecting genetic variation for salamanders in the suburban and urban habitats. Finally, using eDNA from stream water, I found that E. bislineata is present in streams across a gradient of urban development, while another common stream salamander species, Desmognathus fuscus was only detected in more non-urban habitats. With this method, I also detected differences in species composition in urban versus non-urban habitats, mostly due to more non-native species eDNA detected in more urbanized streams. This dissertation provides further understanding of how urbanization affects the evolution of a native amphibian species and how urban development affects stream salamander distribution in the NYC metropolitan area.

Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wroclaw city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2-20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system.

These range from spatially tracking optimal environments, to phenotypically plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation. Due to increases in anthropogenic influence on environments, characteristics of change such as their duration and magnitude are undergoing fundamental shifts away from the natural disturbance regimes that shaped species’ evolution. This dissertation uses empirical data and simulation models to examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change across real, heterogeneous landscapes for multiple species, with an emphasis on anthropogenic changes. I used landscape genetics to evaluate the effects of urbanization on two native amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Population isolation was positively associated with local urbanization and lessened genetic diversity for both species. Resistance surface modelling revealed connectivity was diminished by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic landscape features relative to natural features. Further study of a subset of wood frog populations revealed adaptive evolution associated with urban environments. I identified a set of 37 loci with the capacity to correctly reassign individuals into rural or urban populations with 87.5 and 93.8% accuracy, respectively. I developed an agent-based model to examine how gene flow, rates of change, and strength of landscape spatial and temporal autocorrelation influence abundance outcomes for species experiencing an environmental shift. Analysis of 36 environmental scenarios suggests that environmental variation, which is an emergent property of landscape autocorrelation, is negatively associated with the magnitude and duration of abundance declines following environmental change. Higher levels of gene flow lessened this effect, particularly in abrupt change scenarios, although gradual changes also resulted in demographic costs. Lastly, I used an investigation of an emerging disease in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) to study within-generation responses to environmental pressures. Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing I identified eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the disease and seven related to environmental differences.

This thesis examines how the matrix affects the Neotropical bird community in central Jamaica in landscapes where forest is embedded in three human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) and one natural “matrix” (continuous forest). First, I examine whether richness, community composition, and abundances of resident birds differ in ∼ 100 forest patches within the four matrix types, and relate species responses to traits influencing dispersal, resource acquisition, and/or population growth. Agricultural landscapes were found to retain avian diversity and community assemblages most similar to intact forest relative to peri-urban and bauxite landscapes. Traits related to resource acquisition best predicted species responses, indicating that resource limitation driven by the matrix may be a primary factor driving bird responses to fragmentation. Next, I determine the relative influence of patch area, isolation, vegetation structure, and matrix type on the occupancy dynamics of resident insectivorous birds. Within-patch vegetation and matrix type were the most important determinants of colonization and extinction, but the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation on occupancy dynamics were matrix- and species-dependent. Across the community, the matrix influenced extinction probabilities more than colonization, indicating that extinction processes likely drive population dynamics. Finally, I examine the relative permeability of peri-urban, bauxite, and forested landscapes on the movement of the migrant American Redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla) and the resident Jamaican Tody (Todus todus) by experimentally translocating > 140 birds 0.6–4 km from their territories across landscape treatments. Redstarts returned with greater success and faster speed than Todies. Return success was not impacted by landscape treatment, but both species returned more rapidly in forest relative to bauxite matrix, with return times intermediate in a peri-urban matrix. These findings indicate that bird mobility in fragmented landscapes is mediated by the landscape matrix. This research is among few empirical studies to discern the impacts of different matrix types on species patterns and processes.

The New England cottontail’s range has declined by over 86% (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Fenderson et al. 2014, Brubaker et al. 2014) and remaining populations are small and exhibit fine-scale structure, limited dispersal, and loss of metapopulation function (Fenderson 2011, 2014, Cheeseman 2017, Chapter 1). In the Northeast, declining species of shrubland birds outnumber increasing species three to one (Schlossberg & King 2007). In response to these losses, active management is ongoing to maintain and create shrubland habitat on the landscape to restore populations of specialists dependent on this habitat type. Given the extensive investments and collaboration focused on restoring shrubland habitats in New England, research is needed to monitor the effects of habitat creation on populations of shrubland specialists. Understanding how shrubland specialists are responding to ongoing habitat creation will inform additional restoration strategies in an adaptive management context, an iterative process of incorporating new information into management practices and learning from previous management outcomes. Shrubland habitat creation and management in New England is largely focused on restoring habitat for the New England cottontail, with the idea that other species will also benefit. The New England cottontail is a highly threatened shrubland obligate requiring multiple patches of shrubland habitat within a short dispersal distance to support viable metapopulations long-term. Much of this management has been initiated by the New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative in response to the cottontail’s nine-year candidate listing status under the Endangered Species Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Keystone Initiative. Conservation efforts implemented for the New England cottontail have included the development of a range-wide inter-agency conservation strategy, designation of focal habitat restoration areas and habitat acreage and cottontail population recovery goals, engagement with private organizations and landowners to create shrubland habitat, implementation of a range-wide cottontail occupancy monitoring protocol, and public outreach and education (Fuller & Tur 2012). Habitat management underway incorporates techniques to set back forest succession, including harvesting trees, cutting and mowing to promote shrub regrowth, planting to improve old field habitat, and controlled burning on fire-maintained habitats like pitch pine-scrub oak. Landscape-level conservation design has been initiated to identify best parcels in terms of vegetation type and patch size that can be targeted for restoration (Tash & Litvaitis 2007, Fuller et al. 2011). Knowing how other species respond to widespread habitat management for cottontails is important to understand the full impacts and benefits of currently implemented management and to inform future management strategies. Given the resources invested in restoring shrubland habitat for cottontail populations, and the potential for other shrubland specialist species to benefit from this restoration, designating the New England cottontail a representative species could benefit strategic management for multiple species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Representative species designations are a tool for strategic management to provide the greatest benefit for the most species with available resources. Research is needed to identify which additional species would benefit most from restoration to create habitat for cottontails. I investigated shrubland specialist birds as a suite of species that could benefit from habitat management for cottontails, given declining population trends for shrubland birds and their high conservation need in the Northeast. In this thesis, I investigated the effects of habitat restoration on shrubland specialists in three case studies focused on New England cottontails and shrubland birds. In Chapter 1, I used genetic tools to assess the population structure, genetic diversity, effective population size, and census population size of an isolated New England cottontail population in an urban landscape in Londonderry, New Hampshire. I documented attributes of small populations that pose conservation challenges, including limited dispersal and loss of metapopulation function (Chandler et al. 2015), low genetic diversity, high relatedness (Brook et al. 2002, O’Grady et al. 2006), skewed sex ratios (Tella 2001, Clout et al. 2002), and stochastic decline on isolated patches (Stacey & Taper 1992). I used a resistance surface approach to highlight areas of potential connectivity in the landscape, including powerlines, a shrub wetland, and rail corridor. I parameterized a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that serves as a proof-of-concept for future work to compare the outcomes of alternate restoration scenarios on cottontail population size, genetic diversity, connectivity, and ability to persist in fragmented landscapes given best-case restoration scenarios.

With increases in infrastructure and human settlement, natural areas become fragmented, and small populations in these patches become more vulnerable to genetic drift and are unable to disperse due to barriers to gene flow. Often these pervasive alterations to the environment result in the introduction of exotic species that can thrive in urban habitats with anthropogenically made available resources. Both native and nonnative wildlife that inhabit cities and nearby non-urban areas serve as ideal models to show how populations are evolving in response to developmental pressures. While native rodents in urban areas exhibit patterns of low genetic diversity and genetic connectivity, populations of invasive rodents reveal high connectivity and gene flow. Studying the evolutionary implications of this ecological change, particularly in understudied regions of rapid development like in biodiverse rich areas of Southeast Asia, will be vital to understand the variation of species responses to urbanization. In this study, I explored genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of populations of the native Müller's giant Sunda rat (Sundamys muelleri) and invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) across an urbanization gradient on the island on Borneo. Sundamys muelleri exhibited decreased genetic diversity in urban areas and was differentiated from rural and suburban locations. Populations of S. muelleri also displayed low genetic connectivity with urbanization posing a potential barrier to gene flow. Rattus rattus exhibited decreased genetic diversity in rural areas and a clinal genetic structure across the urbanization gradient. Populations of R. rattus also displayed high genetic connectivity, but development likely still prevents dispersal opportunities. This research provides useful information on how urbanization evolutionarily affects these two species of rodents (a native and invasive) and how development impacts population structure and connectivity.

The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity of Eurycea bislineata (northern two‐lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.",10/grsk56,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2479466639?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=L5B6vj1fRfaCpvXUtbMekgGw%2FzQ%3D,14,3,urbanization reduces gene flow but not genetic diversity of stream salamander populations in the new york city metropolitan area,10/grsk56,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2479466639?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=L5B6vj1fRfaCpvXUtbMekgGw%2FzQ%3D

Despite the ubiquity and the continued growth of urban areas, the effects of urban development on the diversity and composition of plant communities remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I address this issue by investigating the effects of urban development on patches of remnant riparian forest in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. To do this, I used a rural-to-urban gradient approach, comparing the plant species and environmental conditions of sites surrounded by different amounts of urban development. I first explored the effects of different “filters” created by urban development on plant biodiversity using structural equation modeling. In this, I tested the predictions of an established conceptual framework and developed a general model that could be used to compare the effects of urbanization on plant biodiversity across cities. I then examined changes in plant species’ functional traits along the rural-to-urban gradient and compared the species and traits found at these sites to high-quality riparian plant communities that represent potential targets for restoration. I found that plant traits change somewhat predictably along an urbanization gradient, particularly with regard to species’ seed dispersal modes, but that traits may not be as useful for predicting which species will establish in urban restoration efforts. Finally, I assessed the ability of environmental variables and spatial variables describing habitat connectivity to explain variation in plant species composition across sites. I found that species with limited dispersal ability showed the strongest signal of dispersal limitation across sites, and that urban development between sites appears to reduce connectivity for these species. This dissertation provides insight into the ways that urban development is altering riparian forests in the Research Triangle, which may have important impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Ecological theories suggest that areas with higher levels of functional connectivity sustain a more diverse avian population. By identifying the key habitat features that dictate the distribution and abundance of avian populations it is possible to inform planning policy to maximise biodiversity. Bird species presence and abundance across an urban gradient in Birmingham (UK) was surveyed at 70 sites over three sampling periods (between 2009 and 2010), in combination with a tree survey and digital analysis of land use. Functional connectivity was shown to increase the abundance of bird species and to ameliorate the impacts of urban development. Bird species were found to vary with their associations with vegetation structure and a proxy for invertebrate productivity. There was clear evidence for increasing native tree species in the urban matrix to support more bird species. Ringing data collected between 2008 and 2011 were used to examine bird movements through the city and the influence of habitat factors such as connectivity and built space in the matrix. Bird movements between ringing sites demonstrated the permeability of the city and the importance of connectivity in the landscape. This work showed that the composition of the matrix influences bird occupancy and turnover of sites.

Our main goal was to identify shared and private factors in the comparison among species. 199 bank voles and 194 wood mice were collected in 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape, and genotyped at 8 and 7 microsatellites, respectively. Genetic variation and structure were analysed with standard approaches. Effective migration surfaces, isolation by resistance analysis, and regression with randomization were used to study isolation by distance and to estimate the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. Genetic structure was similarly affected by isolation by distance in these species, but the isolation-by-resistance analysis suggests that i) the wood mouse has constrained patterns of dispersal across woodland patches and facilitated connectivity in cultivated areas; ii) the bank vole connectivity is hindered by urban areas, while permeability is facilitated by the presence of woodlands, and cultivated terrains.

In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, we examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the eastern United States. We focused our sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). We performed ddRAD‐Seqon 473 samples, recovered 35,200 SNPs, and then used multiple evolutionary clustering analyses to investigate population structuring. These analyses revealed that pigeons formed two genetic clusters—a northern cluster containing samples from Boston and Providence and a southern cluster containing all other samples. This substructuring is possibly due to reduced urbanization across coastal Connecticut that separates Boston and Providence from New York and mid‐Atlantic cities. We found that pairs of pigeons within 25 km are highly related (Mantel r = 0.217, p = .001) and that beyond 50 km, pigeons are no more related than they would be at random.

Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity on a landscape scale, and for evaluating the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity on forest bird diversity in an urban-rural gradient. The purpose of the analyses was to develop knowledge and methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and assessments in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional scales. The study area was situated in and around Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, covering the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Data on breeding forest birds were collected through bird censuses in an urban-suburban gradient. In order to embrace also the peri-urban areas for a more complete urban-rural gradient, data on two fragmentation-sensitive forest grouse species were obtained through a questionnaire to hunters in the whole study area. Response variables in the analyses were forest bird species richness and diversity, relative species richness and occurrence of single sensitive species like selected sedentary forest birds, including the forest grouse species, and red list species. Habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were analysed using available data on abiotic conditions, including urban disturbances, and vegetation in geographical information systems. In addition, a field study on vegetation structure and composition was performed in a subset of the smaller sample sites. Relationships between the response variables and habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were explored using multivariate statistics. Further, for some models, spatial dependencies were quantified and accounted for. When habitat models were retrieved, they were used for spatial predictions of habitat suitability. They were also applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on sensitive species. In the urban-rural gradient, the forest structure and composition changed, so that in more urban areas, coniferous forest on rich soils, wet forests and wetlands became less abundant and more scattered.

We found evidence of coyotes on 24 of 30 (80%) suburban and 7 of 11 (64%) urban plots. Overall fifty-eight percent of coyote evidence was found within edge habitats, with den sites and tracks the only types of evidence found strictly in interior habitats. Land cover around evidence points included more wooded land cover than expected in suburban areas, suggesting the importance of tree cover for coyote occupancy, and more open space and wooded land cover than expected in urban areas, highlighting their avoidance of heavily populated areas. Coyote diet was assessed through identification of remains of food items recovered in coyote scat. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and small rodents were the most consumed prey in both urban and suburban areas. Coyote consumption of white-tailed deer biomass was 7.2% greater than expected in suburban areas and 10.0% less than expected in urban areas and the difference was significant (P< 0.004). More white-tailed deer, raccoon, and woodchuck biomass was consumed compared to other studies, likely due to high use of road-kill. In suburban areas, coyote selection for road-killed white-tailed deer was positive regardless of white-tailed deer or rabbit abundance. Coyotes in urban areas used a foraging strategy that incorporated both prey selection and switching, with no strong discernable pattern. Radio-telemetry technology was used to gather relocations of coyotes for analysis of home range and cores areas frequented by coyotes. Smaller home ranges were made up of greater proportions of urban land than natural land cover, although there was variation. Core areas were dominated by relatively large patches of natural land cover and had greater connectivity compared to home range areas. Radio-telemetry data suggested that coyotes were selective in their use of space, avoiding urban land in favor of natural land cover.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1790625849?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=yoaaUmh8yhK40gVm9c7KEh3FYd4%3D,NA,1,ecology of coyotes (canis latrans) in the greater detroit area of southeastern michigan,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1790625849?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=yoaaUmh8yhK40gVm9c7KEh3FYd4%3D

Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods. Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables. Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications, functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities. The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks. Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species. Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth. Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either patch density or the presence of linear features. These findings have considerable implications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation. In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species. The most important factors influencing the composition of sites were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity. Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1774248530?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=tTNjAZ32U%2Bx%2FSTqbdyVrOOUOr9w%3D,NA,1,botanical processes in urban derelict spaces,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1774248530?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=tTNjAZ32U%2Bx%2FSTqbdyVrOOUOr9w%3D

My study area consisted of 387 habitat fragments, 54 of which were colonized by prairie dogs. These fragments were highly isolated and surrounded by roads and development, and my studies represent the first studies of prairie dogs in highly urban environments. I evaluate the interactions between urban prairie dogs and vegetation and find that prairie dogs in urban areas tend to be present on sites with high grass coverage, though the grass layer is reduced in the immediate vicinity of the colonies. Prairie dogs interact with vegetation similarly in urban areas and natural habitat, providing evidence that the ecological role of prairie dogs as keystone species may be partly retained in human-dominated landscapes. I provide the first study using mark-resight methodology to evaluate the local population density of prairie dogs, and find it more accurate than traditional methods of burrow counts or visual indices. I observed extremely high densities for prairie dogs in urban settings, probably because of a fence effect where animals are restricted to available habitat due to the difficulty of dispersal in an urban environment. I compare connectivity metrics to determine which have the best predictive power for the occurrence of colonies in this area, and find that complex methods incorporating area of patches and cost-weighted distance surfaces perform best. In general, inclusion of biological information improves the ability of metrics to predict wildlife distribution. This study provides a rare opportunity to compare the performance of connectivity metrics using empirical data on wildlife distribution and will be of benefit to future spatial and landscape analyses. Finally, I evaluate a series of landscape and local variables to determine which have the most importance to the distribution of prairie dogs across our study system. Fragment area and local variables such as litter coverage have the most explanatory power, but all tested metrics had importance to prairie dog occurrence.

My study examines the effects of urbanization on the movements and distribution of songbirds in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I conducted playback and translocation experiments to assess the permeability of small-scale (e.g. transportation corridors, rivers) and large-scale (e.g. multi-lane expressways, areas of urban development) features of the urban landscape, respectively. I then used these empirical data to parameterize spatially explicit models and determine functional landscape connectivity across the study area. Finally, using point surveys conducted at 183 sites across the urban matrix, I examined the role of land cover type, local vegetation characteristics, landscape-level forest cover, and isolation from natural features on the distribution of songbirds. In 563 playback trials involving the responses of 2241 birds, I found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement across linear features; the likelihood of movement sharply decreasing as the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m. The results of 176 translocation trials provided further evidence of the barrier effect of gaps. Multiple gaps, in particular, constrained the movements of both yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) and black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). The bird surveys revealed that natural forest stands played a critical role in sustaining regional avian diversity in the study area. Moreover, functional distance to the nearest forested natural area or water body often explained more variation in the probability of occurrence of focal species than straight-line distance, suggesting that barriers identified from the permeability experiments may have affected not only the movements of songbirds but their settlement patterns as well. Taken together, my results suggest that preserving a functionally connected network of natural areas is vital to conserving avian biodiversity in cities.

This dissertation has two major goals: (1) to document some of the effects of human development on bird distributions and movement in the North Carolina Piedmont, and (2) to test and develop graph theory as a tool that can be used for habitat assessment and conservation in fragmented habitats. These issues are critical to explaining and predicting bird occurrences in today's landscapes and are important for both basic ecological research and management. The first portion of this dissertation uses empirical data collected from 272 point counts to quantify the effects of urbanization on forest songbirds. Initial results indicate that avian community composition varies across the study area with urban land cover and road density. However, an in-depth examination of the effects of roads on species abundance revealed that the importance of roads is simply an artifact of the vegetation and land cover changes that typically accompany them rather than a direct effect of the roads themselves. A final analysis of the field data considered the importance of roads and other land cover classes to bird movement in fragmented landscapes. Using alternative representations of bird dispersal behavior to predict species abundance, I showed that forest interior birds experience high dispersal cost through non-forest habitat but no cost of dispersing over roads. The second portion of this dissertation presents graph theory as a tool for understanding bird movement, distribution, and conservation in fragmented landscapes. I compare the performance of graph theory to a more computationallyand data-intense spatially explicit population model (SEPM) in selecting important habitat patches for conservation, and show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in some cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM.

This urban landscape change may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, I examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the Northeastern United States. I focused my sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). I performed ddRAD‐Seq on 473 samples. My analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. I conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in pigeons. Additionally, spatial genetic patterns may diverge between cities as food accessibility, nesting site availability, and eradication policies differ. Pigeon hobbyists (people who collect, breed, trade, and race pigeons) also vary by region leading to differing degrees of public tolerance for pigeons and impacting the spatial genetic patterns. Fancy and racing pigeons display a variety of characters which are often seen in the feral population, suggesting that these breeds may partially contribute to feral populations. I found that pigeon population structure is influenced by continued introduction of racing/fancy pigeons and the local conditions including attitudes towards pigeons, management practices, and food availability. Furthermore, variation in behavioral traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behavior. I examined the flight initiation distance of pigeons across New York City, USA. I then assessed this behavioral response across the landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment, and the ecological community. I found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity demonstrating that pigeon behavior varies with urbanization, human activity, and ecological attributes. Since behavioral changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes. Overall this research demonstrates that urban landscape heterogeneity may contribute to variable spatial genetic and behavioral responses across a single city, therefore researchers must examine patters at different spatial scales. Moreover, organisms such as pigeons that depend on humans, exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure that reflects human patterns and distributions, stressing the importance of sampling across urban areas.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2572620583?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=OlCpIaxcowniBqWjuWnqSjfS9Kw%3D,NA,1,evolution and ecology of urban pigeons (columba livia) in northeastern north america,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2572620583?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=OlCpIaxcowniBqWjuWnqSjfS9Kw%3D

Specifically, the circuit theory model and gravity floating catchment area method were adopted to evaluate ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS under multiple scenarios in terms of different species dispersal distances and resident travelling modes, and Pareto ranking analysis was utilized to identify conservation priorities of UGS. Wuhan City in central China was taken as a case study. The results show that Wuhan exhibits low synergic relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS, and only approximately 7.51% of UGS patches on average rank high. Based on the frequency of UGS Pareto ranks under different scenarios, the differentiated conservation strategy was developed, which identified 10 key green areas that need to be protected and 11 green areas that need to be restored.

North Texas is home to some the fastest-growing urban areas in the country, including Denton County, as well as at least two declining bumble bee species (B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus). Using a combination of field, molecular DNA and GIS methods I evaluated the persistence of historic bumble bee species in Denton County, and investigated the genetic structure and connectivity of the populations in these spaces. Field sampling resulted in the discovery of both B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus in Denton County's urban green spaces. While the relative abundance of B. fraternus in these spaces was significantly lower than historic levels gleaned from museum records, that of B. pensylvanicus was significantly higher.

To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species.

However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence. Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine-scale variation in socio-economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity. We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.

The planning decisions about urban green space, however, have been based mostly on two factors. Green areas that are perceived as more natural are generally seen as more valuable than those, like playing fields, which are heavily managed. The second factor is the degree of isolation; green spaces, which link together to form 'green corridors', are expected to be more valuable. One might also expect green spaces located within less built-up residential areas to be of higher quality than those within dense housing. This study investigated the relative importance of three factors on the plant diversity of urban green spaces in two case study areas: Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria. These were the position of the green spaces relative to housing of different densities; the type of green spaces, and level of management to which they had been subjected; and the effects of the size of the green space and whether they were connected to others. First, three residential morphology types (high, medium and low density) were delineated from maps and high-quality aerial photographs using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software. The interpretation of aerial photographs showed that high density housing covers 18.0%, medium density 60% and low density 22% of the overall residential areas in Bolton. In Sofia the largest proportion was made up of low density housing (46%), followed by medium density (43%) and high density (11%). A set of 24 sampling plots positioned within the residential green spaces were selected in each of the case study areas. The focus of the study was the herbaceous component of grasslands. The four studied green space types were: parks and recreational gardens, playing fields (in Sofia substituted by roadside verges), derelict areas, and remnants of semi-natural vegetation. These green spaces could be grouped into two categories of management: managed and unmanaged. Overall 174 species of herbaceous angiosperms were identified in Bolton and 246 in Sofia. There were significant differences between the mean species numbers identified in the three housing densities in both case study areas. Least species rich were the green spaces within the high density residential areas. Most species were found in the medium density in Bolton and within the low density in Sofia. There were also differences between the types of green spaces. The most species were found in semi-natural remnants of vegetation and derelict areas. The managed green spaces were less species rich compared with unmanaged ones in both case study areas. A positive correlation was observed between the size of the green space and number of species in Bolton, but in Sofia, the lack of aerial photographs made this test impossible. The connectivity between the green spaces did not, however, correlate with their species richness. In conclusion, these results suggest that the size, management method, type and position within particular residential type are the important factors which determine plant diversity in urban areas. Connectivity between green spaces does not seem to affect diversity. Therefore, the negative effects of urbanisation may best be mitigated by better management of existing urban green space. The results also suggest, albeit tentatively, that the concept of the green corridor may not be that important for maintaining urban plant diversity.

I studied this relationship in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at 18 sites in the Seattle, WA, metropolitan region. Genetic differentiation was best predicted by resistance distances in which resistance to dispersal was linearly related to age of development and a second set of resistance distances in which high and medium urbanization were 100 times more resistant than vegetation land covers. My results suggest that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. The relation to development age suggests that genetic differentiation in the urban system has not yet reached equilibrium, so the effects of connectivity loss will increase. Urbanization can decrease habitat quality that can result in source-sink population dynamics I combined a study of demographic rates with genetic methods to study source-sink population dynamics in Song Sparrows.

The trend in Song Sparrow relative abundance revealed an intrinsic rate of increase of −7.8% annually, and four of 15 sampled populations had finite rates of increase (λ) significantly less than one. Net immigration estimated from genetic assignments was negatively correlated with λ. Net immigration or λ were not correlated with landscape or local habitat metrics. Genetic methods suggest that gene flow is common throughout the region, and Song Sparrows exhibit source-sink population dynamics. I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team to examine the influence of destinations within walking distance and vegetation on walking trips and body mass index (BMI) for residents of Seattle, WA. We measured accessibility and greenness, and self-reported destinations, natural features, walking trips, BMI were measured through a postal survey. Objective accessibility was related to walking trips per month, as was subjective greenness. In areas with high accessibility, BMI was lower in areas that had more greenness. Objective and subjective measurements of accessibility and greenness led to an understanding of variation among walking trips and BMI in different neighborhoods.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305017381?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VQgkHuF9ZodEsKQ1U6L0GKYk14Y%3D,NA,1,urban landscape relationships with song sparrow (melospiza melodia) population structure and connectivity and human health and behavior,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305017381?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VQgkHuF9ZodEsKQ1U6L0GKYk14Y%3D

Gardens represent a considerable proportion of the urban landscape in the UK and have significant potential to promote urban biodiversity and reduce species loss providing they can be designed and managed appropriately. This research focused on gardens in St Andrews, Scotland, and investigated the influence of environmental variables such as age and area on arachnid and beetle biodiversity with the aim of identifying key predictors of arthropod species richness in urban environments. The key result of this research was that the age and area of individual gardens was not a strong predictor of ground active arthropod biodiversity. This suggests that more recently developed or smaller gardens can contribute to the overall urban region species richness pool as well as larger or more ancient gardens. The most important predictor of ground active arachnid and beetle species richness was the proportion of porous (or 'green') habitat surrounding each garden, and suggested that urban density and habitat connectivity at the regional scale are of key importance. In general, variables measured within gardens (e.g. the provision of microhabitats such as leaf litter, non-managed vegetation, etc.) did not exert any measurable effect on the biodiversity of arachnids or beetles.

Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating raptor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes.Methods To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered.Results Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species.

Additionally, urban rivers also offer environmental amenities and can be catalysts for social and economic revitalization in human communities. Despite its importance for both humans and wildlife, blue space in cities used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. My principal objective was to determine how urbanization and water availability affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. I surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a LTER long-term study system located in Phoenix, Arizona. Water physiognomy (shape and size) was the largest factor in shaping the bird community. Connectivity was an important element for waterbird diversity, but not abundance. Urbanization had guild-specific effects on abundance but was not important for waterbird diversity. Habitat-level environmental characteristics were more important than land use on waterbird abundance, as well as diversity. Diving and fish-eating birds were positively associated with large open bodies of water, whereas dabbling ducks, wading birds, and marsh species favored areas with large amounts of shoreline and emergent vegetation. My study supports that Phoenix blue space offers an important subsidy to migrating waterbird communities; while alternative habitat is not a replacement, it is important to consider as part of the larger conservation picture as traditional wetlands decline. Additionally, arid cities have the potential to support high levels of waterbird biodiversity, heterogeneous land use matrix can be advantageous in supporting regional diversity, and waterbirds are tolerant of urbanization if proper resources are provided via the habitat. The implications of this study are particularly relevant to urban planning in arid cities; Phoenix alone contains over 1,400 bodies of water, offering the opportunity to design and improve urban blue space to optimize potential habitat while providing public amenities.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1796864371?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=q%2FGCfVOknRoiqtxYkFOIS6%2F1%2B3k%3D,NA,1,"response of waterbird communities to habitat and landscape structure along an urban gradient in phoenix, arizona",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1796864371?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=q%2FGCfVOknRoiqtxYkFOIS6%2F1%2B3k%3D

We used 13 microsatellite loci to genotype 387 adult and subadult wild boar from four urban forests, adjacent built-up areas and the surrounding rural forests. We applied genetic clustering algorithms to analyse the population genetic structure of the urban boar. We used approximate Bayesian computation to infer the boar's colonization history of the city.

The magnitude of difference between these scores had no interdependence along a development gradient. Assessment of Northern Red-legged Frog locations in Forest Park, resulted in habitat quality scores which were sensitive to the presence or visibility of water sources and other structural components such as woody debris.

Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach.The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests.The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold.

More recently, tick-borne disease emergence is occurring in urban landscapes due to complex feedbacks between the environment, humans, wildlife, and ticks. In this dissertation, I focus on the ecological conditions that allow for tick-borne disease emergence in a city. I use a combination of spatial landscape modeling, empirical data collection, wildlife movement tracking to determine drivers of zoonotic hazards in New York City, NY, and employ vector genomics to examine vector dispersal in the northeastern United States. In chapter one, I pair tick collection throughout the five boroughs of New York City with landscape connectivity modeling to examine how green space connectivity and habitat availability affects the density and infection of questing nymphs – an important epidemiological measure of human risk for tick-borne diseases. I found that green spaces that were highly connected for deer had higher nymph density and infection prevalence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. In chapter two, I use camera trapping, live trapping, and tick collection on Staten Island, NY, to examine how landscape fragmentation – through changing habitat size and connectivity – shapes the host community available for questing Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Further, I examined whether patterns in host species abundance and activity correlate with the density of nymphs and their infection prevalence with three different pathogens that vary in host-specificity, B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. I found associations between host species and the size and connectivity of the park habitat, identified host species which amplified and removed ticks in the environment, and determined links between host activity and abundance and the infection prevalence of nymphs with host-specific pathogens. In chapter three, I utilize movement data from 59 white-tailed deer on Staten Island, NY, to assess the drivers of movement and its impact on tick-borne disease hazard across the landscape. I found that white-tailed deer avoid anthropogenic development at fine spatial scales when establishing home ranges but select for anthropogenic resources within their home range, increasing the potential to distribute ticks into environments that interface with humans. Finally in chapter four, I use double digest Restriction Associated DNA sequencing to examine the genetic differentiation of six I. scapularis populations across the Northeast region. I found high levels of gene flow across a spatial scale of 400 km, likely resulting from frequent host-mediated dispersal events combined with large I. scapularis populations. Taken together, this work emphasizes that host movement and ecology are critical determinants of urban tick-borne disease emergence through directing vector and pathogen dispersal, serving as pathogen reservoirs in urban habitats, and interfacing with humans in unique ways that increase human exposure to zoonotic hazards.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2626931840?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=pK6%2FtapEd3JxZXiABBDUXMGc15E%3D,NA,1,the ecological drivers of urban tick-borne disease emergence,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2626931840?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=pK6%2FtapEd3JxZXiABBDUXMGc15E%3D

We used playback to survey primate populations in 22 focal patches and assessed the landscape within a 1000 m buffer zone around each site. In A. caraya, occupancy was influenced by the shape of the focal patches, the amount of forest and fragmentation level of the landscape. Focal patch size and the permeability of the matrix were the principal determinants of the occupancy of S. libidinosus. None of the predictors influenced patch occupancy in C. penicillata, and the structure of the vegetation did not influence occupancy in any of the species.

We address this gap, focusing on spatial fit in an urban and peri-urban regional landscape. Such landscapes typically exhibit significant fragmentation of remnant habitats, which can limit critical species dispersal. This may have detrimental effects on species persistence and ecosystem functioning if land use is planned without consideration of the spatial patterns of fragmentation. Managing habitat fragmentation is particularly challenging when the scale of fragmentation reaches beyond the control of single managers, thereby requiring different actors to coordinate their activities to address the problem at the appropriate scale. We present a research approach that maps patterns of collaborations between actors who manage different parts of a landscape, and then relates these patterns to structures of ecological connectivity. We applied our approach to evaluate the fit between a collaborative wetland management network comprising all 26 municipalities in the Stockholm County in Sweden and an ecologically defined network of dispersed but ecologically interconnected wetlands. Many wetlands in this landscape are either intersected by the boundary between two or more municipalities, or are located close to such boundaries, which implies a degree of ecological interconnectedness and a need for intermunicipal coordination related to wetland management across boundaries. We first estimated the level of ecological connectivity between wetlands in neighboring municipalities, and then used this estimate to elaborate the level of social-ecological fit vis-a-vis intermunicipal collaboration. We found that the level of fit was generally weak. Also, we identified critical misalignments of ecological connectivity and intermunicipal collaboration, respectively, as well as collaborations that represented an adequate alignment. These findings inform on where to most effectively allocate limited resources of collaborative capacity to enhance the level of social-ecological fit.

The present study focused on the connotation of ecological property, set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks with Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thereafter, seven typical urban parks in Xiamen were taken as a case to verify the index system. Firstly, this study set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks taking the rationality of ecological structure as well as the efficiency of functions as the criterias. The index system consisted of four aspects, which were community structure, landscape pattern, ecological service function and garden ornamental function. Then the degree of ecological property was divided into four grades according to their scores, which were excellent(grade I), good(grade II), fair(grade III), and poor(grade IV). Secondly, we measured the principal indexes such as vegetation quantity, tree species diversity, landscape diversity, birds diversity, and carbon fixation and oxygen release, decrease of temperature and increase of humidity, dust-retention and noise reduction in seven typical parks of Xiamen. According to their vegetation characteristics, seven parks were classified to semi-natural parks(Huweishan Park, Xianyue Park and Zhonglun Park)and artificial parks(Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, Bailuzhou Park and Huli Park). Finally, these seven parks were evaluated using the index system and the evaluating scores were in the order of Huweishan Park(0.6830, II)>Xianyue Park(0.6698, II)>Zhongshan Park(0.6365, II)>Nanhu Park(0.6120, II)>Zhonglun Park(0.6057, II)>Huli Park(0.5181, III)>Bailuzhou Park(0.5067, III). According to our investigation and evaluation, the structure and function of the seven parks were further analyzed. The results indicated that Huweishan Park and Xianyue Park had higher green space ratios and native species percentages, richer community levels and more diverse bird species than artificial parks. Their average patch areas were larger and plaque integrity and connectivity were better, but the landscape diversities were lower. These two parks thus had better ecological service functions, but weak garden ornamental functions. In Zhonglun Park, the community structure was simplified after artificial modification, and its ecological service functions were poorer than the other semi-natural pakrs. In the artificial parks, Zhongshan Park and Nanhu Park had more diverse tree species than the others, with more rational collocation of native species and exotic species. The landscape types were diverse, but their fragmentation degrees were high. In Bailuzhou Park, the community structure was simple and tree species were poor. In Huli Park, there was a large number of recreation facilities and water surface area and the green space ratio was low. With regard to functions, Zhongshan Park had strong ecological service functions while the other three artificial parks had weak ecological service functions, but strong garden ornamental functions.

Some of the most significant change has occurred in developing countries, where amenity migration to rural areas within commuting distance of expanding urban centers has fundamentally restructured the configuration, hydrology and ecologies of surrounding watersheds. The export of urbanization to the countryside is manifested by rapid conversions of greenfields to impervious covers designed for human use, conversions that have consumed and fragmented networks of green infrastructure supporting growing populations. While the benefits of urbanization to human populations have been substantial, the ability of novel and evolving landscapes to sustain the production of environmental services, such as the ability to purify water, sequester climate-changing carbon, and harbor biodiversity, is poorly understood and historically shown to be compromised. The pace of urbanization, and particularly the combinatorial effects of climate change and development-caused hydrological alteration, has made the task of managing landscapes for human well-being increasingly difficult. Given the persistence of land change drivers such as urban population growth, there is a critical need to describe the trajectory of land cover change using both theory and projection, and anticipate impacts associated with urban form in order to proactively respond to environmental vulnerabilities. A socio-ecological systems approach to the challenge of sustainable environmental provisioning has facilitated efforts to understand the dynamics of co-evolving human and environmental systems. However, a lack of concise theory regarding urban pattern and process, and the paucity of representative case study, has left the role of spatial structure in modulating ecosystem function largely unexplored. To overcome some of these challenges, I describe a series of three related studies where I used a novel integration of land change and ecosystem services simulations in order to map and measure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in transitioning socio-ecological landscapes (SEL), and generate ecosystemscale cause and effect data. In the first study I used this data to estimate the costs of waterborne non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration, and land cover based revenues for a rapidly urbanizing model system over a 24 year period. I also compared the effect associated with alternative patterns of urban growth, contrasting sprawl, infill and de-regulated scenarios with business as usual trends to gauge the effectiveness of environmental planning paradigms, such as “smart growth”. In the second, I tested the capacity a leading theory to explain the role of spatial heterogeneity in modulating ecosystem function in urban systems, to induce the integrated simulation results. Using structural equation modeling to translate the conceptualizations of Alberti (2005) into testable hypotheses, I tested for direct, indirect and modulating effects of landscape composition, connectivity, form, and land use intensity on the production of NPSP and carbon storage. In the third I examined land cover projection data for the presence of patterns suggesting that landscapes evolved in predictable ways. Using a dynamic proxy to bridge human and environmental effect, I tracked the evolution of connectivity in urbanizing watersheds by holding magnitude of change constant for three pattern alternative, and analyzing spatial configuration using distance-based, structural and circuit-based methods. These methods represent a move to predictive, rather than reactive, analytical paradigm, and allow us to move beyond the focus of managing current problems. They emphasize the utility of integrated urban growth-ecosystem service analyses in order to anticipate environmental trade-offs likely required by society. My findings emphasize the need for ecosystem service analyses to more adequately understand development tradeoffs in the metropolitan context. We conclude that not all urban growth impacts environments evenly, and that by controlling the compositional mix, configuration and connectedness, not just the amount of development, we can influence more benign environmental outcomes. To reduce environmental impacts regionally, planners are advised to manage amplifying effects of development by maintaining land cover diversity, and limiting the connectivity of developed land covers along hydrological gradients.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1884277983?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=0leUTZuDuZPteWSzipU863XXHFw%3D,NA,1,the role of spatial heterogeneity and urban pattern in modulating ecosystem services,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1884277983?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=0leUTZuDuZPteWSzipU863XXHFw%3D

Landscape ecological planning can effectively reduce landscape fragmentation and improve intensive management. The result found that the descending order of the Shannon index was current landscape, landscape ecological planning, and traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning could protect the natural diversity than traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning enables the creation of long corridors, with higher densities and connectivity and lower average corridor widths than traditional planning.

This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly.

Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme - can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance.

The amount of suitable habitat declined with increasing urbanisation whilst fragmentation increased. Towards the city centre, habitat clustered around major waterways. Riparian networks showed clear potential to facilitate the restoration of connectivity between urban and fringing habitat and we identify 'missing links' in this network - key opportunities for habitat restoration.

We sampled riparian forest plant communities along an urban-to-rural gradient and used redundancy analysis to identify predictors of species composition patterns for groups of species categorized by nativity and seed dispersal mode. We first compared the ability of different models of habitat connectivity (least-cost paths that avoided urban land cover versus Euclidean and along-stream distance) to explain spatial patterns of species composition. We then partitioned the variation in species composition explained by habitat connectivity models, local environmental conditions and measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape. ResultsMain conclusionsWe found that several groups of native species were best explained by least-cost path models that avoided urban development, suggesting that urbanization impedes dispersal within this landscape, particularly for short-dispersed species. Environmental variables related to urbanization (e.g., temperature, stream incision) were important predictors of species composition for many species groups, but measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape were more important for exotic than for native species. Our results demonstrate that urbanization influences plant species composition via its effects on both habitat connectivity and environmental conditions. However, the strength of these effects varies somewhat predictably across seed dispersal modes and between native and exotic species.

However, the assessment of urban landscape permeability usually considers biotic and abiotic conditions, with sociopolitical dimensions (e.g., zoning regulations) - also important in shaping urban biodiversity - being underrepresented in the formulation of resistance surfaces. Our main goal was to compare urban landscape permeability for birds between two scenarios: one that considers only species' responses to land cover for the formulation of resistance surfaces (LandC), and another that incorporates how birds would respond to different levels of occupation (i.e., amount of permeable area and maximum building height per individual lot) given the urban zoning regulations defined by the city's master plan (LandC + UrbZ). We used the software LSCorridors to simulate Multiple Least Cost Corridors (MLCC) for five forest bird species. We hypothesized that incorporating master plan regulations would better describe the variation on landscape resistance through the urban landscape. The simulations resulted in different MLCC among species and between scenarios, highlighted by differences in landscape permeability. As expected, simulations for scenario LandC resulted in more options for straighter paths than simulations for scenario LandC + UrbZ. Our results demonstrate the potential influences of sociopolitical aspects on landscape permeability modelling. Within cities, species movements are influenced not only by behavioral and environmental characteristics, but also by the urban landscape that was shaped by planning and management decisions throughout a city's history.

However, it is not known whether varying habitat structures and natural resource availability associated with racial segregation affect the demographics and evolution of urban wildlife populations. To address this question, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived nuclear genetic data from 7,698 individuals spanning 39 terrestrial vertebrate species sampled in 268 urban locations throughout the United States. We found generally consistent patterns of reduced genetic diversity and decreased connectivity in neighborhoods with fewer White residents, likely because of environmental differences across these neighborhoods. The strength of relationships between the racial composition of neighborhoods, genetic diversity, and differentiation tended to be weak relative to other factors affecting genetic diversity, possibly in part due to the recency of environmental pressures on urban wildlife populations. However, the consistency of the direction of effects across disparate taxa suggest that systemic racism alters the demography of urban wildlife populations in ways that generally limit population sizes and negatively affect their chances of persistence. Our results thus support the idea that limited capacity to support large, well-connected wildlife populations reduces access to nature and builds on existing environmental inequities shouldered by predominantly non-White neighborhoods.

This landscape context could lead to an increase in risk-taking behavior by carnivores if burned areas do not allow them to meet their energetic needs, potentially leading to human-wildlife conflict.2,3 We studied mountain lion behavior using GPS location and accelerometer data from 17 individuals tracked before and after a large wildfire (the 2018 Woolsey Fire) within a highly urbanized area (Los Angeles, California, USA). After the wildfire, mountain lions avoided burned areas and increased behaviors associated with anthropogenic risk, including more frequent road and freeway crossings (mean crossings increased from 3 to 5 per month) and greater activity during the daytime (means from increased 10% to 16% of daytime active), a time when they are most likely to encounter humans. Mountain lions also increased their amount of space used, distance traveled (mean distances increased from 250 to 390 km per month), and intrasexual overlap, potentially putting them at risk of intraspecific conflict.

Few studies have been conducted on the impacts of land use type's changes on real-world multi-species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of overall and land use changes on real-world multispecies' habitat changes, particularly changes in landscape connectivity. We attempted to answer the following research questions: ( 1 ) how to measure the positive or negative effects of overall and land use changes on landscape connectivity of multispecies with different ecological requirements; (2) how to spatialize the impacts to identify priority of the protected areas? Gongyi City of Henan Province, a typical agricultural area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, was selected as a case study area. The mammals lived in the region, Sil>erian Weasel (Mus tela sibirica) , Tolai Hare (Lepus tolai) and Yellow-throated Marten (Martes flavigula) , were selected as the target species. Each species disj>ersal capacity was determined as 3 km, 7 km, and 7 km respectively according to their biological and ecological needs. Based on geographic information system technology, the land use changes in the study area from 1990 to 2011 were analyzed and were divided into 121 land use change types. Two connectivity indicators, the probability index of connectivity (PC) and the importance value (percentage of the variation in PC, dPCk) , were calculated. Then, the spatial distribution map of connectivity degree was constructed by using the inverse distance weight function. The results showed that great changes have taken place among 121 land use types from 1990 to 2011. The overall land use changes resulted in the increase of landscape connectivity (representing by the PC) , with an increase of 22.22%, 25.64% and 45.46% to Siberian Weasel, Tolai Hare and Yellow-throated Marten, respectively. There was a difference between the PC calculated from overall and land use types changes. The impact of each land use type change on the PC was different. The increase and decrease of the PC were closely related to the increase and decrease of habitat patches area, respectively. From the spatial distribution map of multi-species landscape connectivity, the key areas of species conservation could he well identified. The study results highlighted the importance of habitat area and habitat connectivity for the biological conservation. This methodology used in this study was useful for conservation planning and landscape management, especially to spatialize the impacts of land use change on multi-species landscape connectivity. © 2020 Science Press.

With rapid urbanization in the Three Gorges Reservoir region, natural area fragmen- tation and habitat loss are inevitable. Taking Kaizhou New Town as an example, our study built the urban ecological networks by least-cost path modeling and GIS technology in order to facilitate the establishment of native tree species. The best threshold for urban ecological networks was ob- tained by the verification from graph theory functioning index. Finally, the priority of habitat pro- tection and restoration was determined after evaluating the importance grades of patches/ connec- tivities. We set a native tree, Pterocarya stenoptera as a surrogate species and used the habitat suitability assessment values to build the cost surface for least-cost model by Linkage Mapper Toolist. The observed maximum seed dispersal distance (300 m) of P. stenoptera was used as the distance threshold for network analysis. 75 target patches were selected as habitat sources to de-velop networks. Under the 300 m distance threshold, 98 links were simulated for the network, and were grouped into six grades according to their importance values. We found the links with higher importance values almost all existed along the bank between the Pengxi River and Hanfeng Lake. Among these, the most important link was between Hanfeng Lake Park and Kaizhou Plan- ning Institute; the second important link was located on both sides of the highway bridge over the Pengxi River. The integral index of connectivity of the whole landscape would be reduced by 19.1% if the two links were removed. Additionally, we found that the importance of the link was not significantly correlated with the important values of the two patches that the link connected. Link importance may also relate to the shape and spatial location of patches. Based on these re- sults, we proposed some network improvement strategies.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the effects of urbanization levels on birds relative density and richness during spring-summer (breeding season) and autumn-winter seasons (non-breeding season). Generalized linear models (GLM) were identified for the landscape composition and configuration that drive relative density and richness in native bird communities. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we identified the landscape composition and configuration factors affecting bird foraging and roosting at urbanization levels. The results showed high dependency of waders and granivores on paddy fields and dry arable land respectively during the breeding season. During non-breeding season, wetland abundance, land cover, connectivity and total area of BGI were important habitat factors in attracting birds. Moreover, the landscape composition and configuration factors of BGI: wetlands as well as farmland habitats, are the main environmental cues that influence bird foraging. Therefore, to increase habitat suitability over landscape matrix, we propose creation of multiple waterbodies and green corridors of variable types and sizes on natural patches to improve the connectivity of ecological network.

The total area of the patches was about 70.45 km2, and 40% of patches area had a low contribution to connectivity. The southern part of the study area exhibited the best landscape connectivity, followed by the middle and northern parts. In the south, numerous corridors clustered into net structure, and the network structure is complex. In the middle of the study area, the Qinhuai River mainly formed a circular corridor.

Ideally, least-cost models should be parameterized with field data for a specific organism (usually a small animal); however, these data are difficult and time-consuming to collect, and this has resulted in a large number of studies relying entirely or in large part on collective expert opinion. Different experts may assign different values and therefore affect the reliability of network simulation. Therefore, we adopted the Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, which is a measure of human disturbance of ecosystems, to quantify the relative costs of land use/cover types. In addition, we chose not to use small mammals as the individual surrogate for designing our urban ecological network. Most studies of animal movement patterns have been conducted in continuous forest landscapes, which are very different from patchy urban environments. These are characterized by much smaller and fragmented habitat patches, surrounded by a non-living concrete matrix with various threats hostile to life. Instead, we used native trees as individual surrogates and their seed dispersal pattern, based on a field survey, for devising and simulating a functional urban ecological network. Taking Christchurch, New Zealand, as an example, our study used a climax native forest tree, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides as a surrogate in establishing our urban ecological network. We used the LDI index to build the cost surface for a least-cost model in ArcGIS 10.0, and the observed maximum seed dispersal distance of D. dacrydioides (1200 m) as the threshold distance for network analysis in Conefor 2.6. Under the 1200 m threshold distance, a total of 408 links were simulated in the study area. These were grouped into 10 importance grades using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis in SPSS 21.0 combined with input from decision-makers. Among these, the three most important links were between Richmond Park and Petrie Park, Hansons Reserve and Auburn Reserve, and between Centaurus Park and King George Reserve. They were identified as the cut-links in a landscape graph, i.e. removal would disconnect critical components in the landscape. Indeed, if these links were absent, the Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC) of the whole landscape would be reduced by 31.73%. Additionally, our study found that there was no linear relationship (Pearson’s r =0.078, P =0.118) between link importance value and total area of habitat connected. That is, the links between larger habitats are not necessarily more important to the network. Further studies are needed to support this finding. Overall, our case study suggests that the combination of least-cost pathway analysis and graph-theoretical algorithms is an efficient approach for simulating and prioritizing functional connectivity in urban landscapes, and might be valuable for Chinese urban ecological network planning. Furthermore, the energy-consumption based LDI index was shown to be a reliable measurement of relative cost values of land use/cover types. However, it should be pointed out that the LDI index was calculated based on western land use/cover types, which are different from those used in China. It is recommended that when being applied in China, the LDI index should be adjusted to China’s land use/cover types. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

In order to explore the responses of urban plant diversity to the changes of landscape pattern, we chose the urban area surrounded by round-city highway as research object, set 36 plots in different directions with the Gupeng Square as the center, investigated the plant group in each of the plots through coverage rank method of Braun-Blanquet, and examined the features of plant species diversity in Xuzhou's greenlands. Meanwhile, we divided the landscape of the research area into seven categories: buildings, grasslands, forest lands, waste lands, water areas, roads and farmlands with the help of Erdas, GIS software and Landsat TM remote sensing images from 2005 to 2015 as basic data source. The features of landscape pattern in the research area were analyzed by Fragstats software. We set nine different buffer districts within each of the sample plot by applying the space analyzing function of GIS, calculated 39 landscape pattern metrics using Fragstats, and explored the features of how plant diversity responsed to landscape pattern. After that, the landscape pattern metrics with significant influence on the plant diversity of urban greenlands under different extents were selected by redundant analysis (RDA). The results showed that the plant diversity had obvious temporal and spatial scale effects in responses to landscape pattern and landscape elements. In 2005, the patch area and shape metrics of unused land and farmland could better explain plant diversity in 800 m buffer zone. The patch fragmentation and connectivity metrics of construction land had significant impacts on plant diversity within the extent of 800-2000 m. In 2015, grassland and forest landscapes better explained plant diversity in the 800 m buffer zone while construction sites and unused land had a remarkable impact on plant diversity in the extent of 1000-2000 m. The current plant diversity was more strongly influenced by the 2005 landscape type metrics, indicating that the plant diversity lagged in its response to the changes of landscape pattern. The pattern metrics of landscape level were more consistent with the landscape-class level metrics, indicating that the interaction between species and spatial scale was more dependent on the landscape type.

As an important component of urban biodiversity, spontaneous herbaceous plants play an essential role in the ecological functions of urban river corridors. Currently, the influence of the landscape structure within corridors on plant diversity has been poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the species and functional diversity, especially the functional traits of origin, pollination, and dispersal, of spontaneous herbaceous plants in the Wenyu River-North Canal riparian corridor in Beijing. The results showed that urban riparian corridors have a positive effect on the spread of alien and invasive plants as well as increasing the native plant diversity. No significant differences in diversity indicators but significant differences in the composition of functional traits between habitat types. Plants with long pollination and dispersal distances tended to be more closely related to the landscape structure indices at larger scales. Invasive plants were more common in patches with significant connectivity, while native plants were positively correlated with water and road connectivity. Anemophilous and anemochores were more common in habitats with sinuous edges. Ant-dispersed plants were closely related to the water bodies. Autochores were positively correlated with the connectivity of habitat patches. Plants dispersed by birds and mammals were weakly correlated with landscape structure. Our study underlines that emphasis should be placed on the support for plant pollination and dispersal, together with the prevention and control of invasive plants in the construction and management of future urban ecological corridors. © 2023",10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109869,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145974709&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2023.109869&partnerID=40&md5=c135cb9a2c7bdb2de703b89d4e1a54a3,146,7,"how urban riparian corridors affect the diversity of spontaneous herbaceous plants as pollination and dispersal routes - a case of the wenyu river- north canal in beijing, china",10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109869,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145974709&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2023.109869&partnerID=40&md5=c135cb9a2c7bdb2de703b89d4e1a54a3

These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density.

A rapid survey in 71 nature reserves in the metropolitan of Perth noted surrounding land uses, types of disturbances, rated the level of weeds, rubbish, formal and informal walking paths and fire influence, and estimated vegetation condition. These data were analysed against information on reserve area and shape, connectivity to other native vegetation, period of patch encapsulation, distance from the city centre and local population density to reveal patterns of fragmentation and disturbance in the metropolitan area. Smaller reserves occurred in the highly populated inner metropolitan area, and these reserves displayed high levels of fragmentation, higher levels of weed infestation and path density and low vegetation condition. Reserves were larger, with high levels of connectivity and with less weed cover and higher vegetation condition in the outer metropolitan area. The research highlighted that whilst reserve attributes are largely set in inner urban areas, planning is required in outer metropolitan areas to ensure patches remain well connected and of optimal size and shape. Inner metropolitan reserves should also be preserved and managed, as they are highly valuable for representing the vegetation types that once occurred there, and for providing natural areas for inner city residents.

As such, native species richness should increase with forest patch size within the urban landscape and increased connectivity to other urban forest patches and rural forests. Our objective was to link urban land cover with forest patch richness and recruitment. We used U.S. National Park Service (NPS) data from parks in the Eastern USA to examine forest patchiness and connectivity in relatively large, intact landscapes.We applied a similar approach to field data collected along an urban-rural gradient in Western New York (WNY). We predicted that urban forest patches are isolated habitats with tree seedling and canopy richness driven by patch size and connectivity with surrounding forest patches. The WNY forest patches were surrounded by much less forest cover compared to NPS forests, and native tree species richness and abundance were negatively impacted by urban land cover. In all parks, we found increased tree seedling richness with park area, and decreasing species richness with the incursion of non-native species.

From a management perspective, three options are available: Increase park area, increase habitat quality within parks and increase connectivity between parks. We used two woodpecker species, a generalist species (Great Spotted Woodpecker) and a habitat specialist (Middle Spotted Woodpecker), as indicators to identify key variables promoting biodiversity in the city parks of Vienna. Bird surveys were carried out during winter time between 2005 and 2015 in 29 urban parks. An information theoretic approach based on generalised linear models identified park area as the most relevant local variable, positively affecting the occurrence of both species. The variable was included in all best ranked models of the two woodpecker species (based on Akaike's information criterion corrected for small-sample sizes). Other local scale variables as well as the position of city parks within the urban matrix and their connectivity were of minor importance. Our results also provide some evidence that city parks may act as refuges for birds during cold winters.

As landscape planners try to increase the quality of living in the urban environment, efforts are focused only on the hot spots which often cater only to the recreational needs of urban dwellers. In Quezon City, the local government unit plans to create the Green Lung Network featuring a chain of developments linking La Mesa Nature Reserve, the largest green space in Metro Manila, to all the open spaces and parks in the city. However, the chosen areas to be connected are based only on area size of green spaces and opportunities for economic development. To support and enhance the connectivity plan of the city government, this study aims to identify the focal nodes which represent the key habitat patches of interest on the landscape between which flows are modelled in circuit analysis for simulating an ecological connectivity network. Parameters are based on empirical habitat-use data on the preference of biological indicators/focal species. For computational feasibility, instead of treating every occurrence of suitable habitat on the landscape as a focal node, this study applies the Habitat Availability (reachability) concept using the GIS tool Conefor Sensinode. This allows ranking habitat patches (patches prioritization) by their contribution to landscape connectivity, which provides objective criteria for the selection of the most critical habitat areas for conservation planning purposes. Not only the spatial arrangement of the habitat is considered (structural connectivity), but also the dispersal distances and the behavioural response of species to the physical structure of the landscape (functional connectivity) is taken into account in the analysis. The results revealed that focal nodes of Quezon City include not only the ecological cores but also other tiny patches of green spaces. Moreover, a more surprising result is that some highly vegetated nodes did not qualify as priority nodes for conservation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1755-1315/501/1/012013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087048336&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f501%2f1%2f012013&partnerID=40&md5=d1fb0fb2f57e87cea5acbea1ab11a5d9,501,1,"focal nodes identification using habitat availability concept for simulation of ecological connectivity network of quezon city, philippines",10.1088/1755-1315/501/1/012013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087048336&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f501%2f1%2f012013&partnerID=40&md5=d1fb0fb2f57e87cea5acbea1ab11a5d9

In this study, we used least-cost path and UNICOR cumulative resistant kernel analyses to simulate the ecological connectivity network across the Luohe Region of China, and used the results to prioritize ecological connectivity network linkages and core areas. Our analysis produced three main results: (1) Least-cost paths passed through all the core areas because they did not consider species’ dispersal limits. (2) Species with dispersal abilities ≤ 2 km, conversely, were predicted by resistant kernel analysis to have highly fragmented functional connectivity networks in the Luohe region, while species with dispersal abilities between 4 km and 8 km were predicted to have moderate levels of functional connectivity, and species with dispersal abilities ≥ 16 km showed high connectivity across most of the study area.

The intersection of least-cost paths with the 2 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths was the first protection priority, the intersection of least-cost paths with the 8 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths was the second protection priority, 8 km threshold scenario of factorial least-cost paths without core areas was the third protection priority.

The dispersal ability of organisms across changing landscapes is critical for long-term biodiversity conservation, and successful dispersal of organisms always depends on the landscape connectivity. The landscape fragmentation caused by roads has significant effects on the landscape pattern and ecological processes, such as the migration of species and biodiversity maintenance in different ecosystems of landscape. This paper aims to analyse the road impact on forest landscape connectivity in mountain area of Gongyi City, Henan Province, China. The landscape connectivity is evaluated based on a graph-theory framework, in which a graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally. Both the graph structure and the habitat availability metrics provide significant improvements for analyzing landscape connectivity and decision making in conservation planning of different ecosystems or landscapes. The geographic data sets for the study area, such as DEM, landuse, soil, vegetation and hydrology, were collected and managed in GIS. Two connectivity indicators, the probability index of connectivity (PC) and the importance value (Percentage of the variation in PC, dPCk), were calculated. Considering the dispersal distances for different organisms, we examined the variation of landscape connectivity of the woodland in the low and middle mountainous areas according to five distance thresholds: 0.5 km, 1 km, 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km. The importance values of the woodland patches were calculated in the scenarios with roads and without roads in different dispersal distances. In addition, the impact of roads on the landscape connectivity of five selected woodland patches was elucidated in detail. The results shows that: (1) the woodland landscape PC values tend to increase with the distance thresholds from 0.5 km to 10 km, in both scenarios of with roads or without roads; (2) there are few patches with larger area, and in the “very high” and “high” categories of contribution to woodland landscape connectivity; (3) the dPCk values of woodland landscape patches gradually decrease with the segmentation of roads, especially for some small patches. We conclude that the roads have important effects on the forest connectivity in the study area. The landscape indexes (such as distance threshold, node position of forest patch and forest area) and the topographical factors (elevation and slope) should be comprehensively considered when analyzing the relationships between roads and forest connectivity. Moreover, the case study also proves that the analysis of landscape connectivity could and should be used as a criterion for selecting important patches in woodland restoration planning. The analytical methods used in this paper are relatively easy to implement, and thus have application potentials in ecological restoration management and landscape planning. © 2014, Science Press.

Maintaining landscape connectivity of natural habitats is one of the most effective methods for alleviating these related problems. Landscape connectivity describes the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes ecological flow and movement among habitat patches. By integrating information related to landscape structure and ecological processes, landscape connectivity describes the effects of habitat fragmentation on the organisms living within the landscape. Graph theory provides powerful tools for assessing landscape connectivity, and has become a popular research method in recent years. However, some issues related to the application of graph-based methods still need to be discussed and analyzed, such as choosing a proper threshold distance and gaining an understanding of various connectivity indices. This study used the graph theory method to assess the landscape connectivity of natural forest in Minqing County, Fuzhou City, China. A comprehensive method was utilized to assign a reasonable threshold distance, which consisted of three steps; namely, determining the range of the maximum dispersal distance of a focal species, enumerating a gradient distance value, and an experiment using link thresholding. Six indices were used to assess the landscape connectivity of the study area; number of links (NL), number of components (NC), Harary index (H), area-weighted flux (AWF), integral index of connectivity (IIC), and probability of connectivity (PC). We harvested data related to the natural commonweal forests of Mingqing County from the data of 2010 National Forest Resource Inventory using ArcGIS 10.2 to define habitat patches in the study area. The six landscape connectivity indices were calculated using Conefor Sensinode 2.6 software. Using the comprehensive method, 1 km was found to be the optimal threshold distance that best presented the structure of the landscape. A medium-level structure, consisting of 56 components was detected using the NL and NC indices. Based on the binary (H, IIC) and probability (AWF, PC) indices, the level of landscape connectivity of the natural forests in Minqing is comparatively low. The patch importance indices (dIs) aided in identifying the most important patches that could potentially affect the overall level of connectivity. We determinded that the main component provided 90% of the connecting functions in maintaining the landscape connectivity; however, losing a single critical patch could significantly reduce overall connectivity. The results indicated that this new method involving evaluation of the threshold distance could help researchers determine more accurate distance values for landscape connectivity, and therefore, this method would be applicable for both scientific research and planning. In addition, binary and probability indices could be used together to reveal landscape structure and the spatial patterns of patch importance. In our analysis, we found that the values of dI are generally proportional to the area of patches; however, patch area is not the dominate element that determines the dI values of the most critical patches. Other patch features, such as patch position, may have greater influence on the dI values for the extremely important patches. This may be caused by a commonly used but inaccurate method of evaluating patch attributes. This topic required further investigation and improvement in future studies. In conclusion, this study will help promote the application of graph theory in research studies related to landscape connectivity, and can provide guidance for land managers tasked with conserving biodiversity. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

This ecological problem is spreading from cities to counties dominated by villages and towns, and is especially prevalent in economically developed areas. Constructing a reasonable ecological network is an effective way to balance the contradiction between regional development and ecological protection. Taking Anji County of the Zhejiang Province, China as an example, this study first identified ecological sources based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and connectivity analysis, and then extracted and constructed ecological networks by using a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and network analysis. Finally, the results were optimized by adding additional ecological sources and setting stepping stones. The priority of the corridor is determined by the gravity model, and the analysis of the ecological networks in this study drills down to the town scale. The results show that the initially constructed ecological network includes 10 ecological sources and 22 ecological corridors, of which six are important ecological corridors that need priority construction. However, the ecological networks were less distributed in the central and northern regions, so four supplementary ecological sources and two stepping stones were added to optimize the ecological network. The connectivity of the optimized ecological network improved, and the values of alpha (the closure), beta (line-point rate) and gamma (network connectivity) increased by 4.6%, 10.45% and 2.18%, respectively. In addition, there were obvious differences in the area and land use types of ecological networks among towns, so it is necessary to formulate targeted construction strategies.

Although urban forest are known to host a high diversity of saproxylic beetles (i.e. those associated with dead wood), contributions dealing with the role of urban green spaces for their conservation are lacking. We investigated the importance of urban green spaces for saproxylic and non-saproxylic tenebrionid beetles in urban Rome. Based on species vulnerability scores we calculated two indices of area prioritisation, the Biodiversity Conservation Concern (BCC) and the Biodiversity Conservation Weight (BCW) for saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. Site area and forest surface correlated positively with saproxylic richness, whereas site isolation correlated negatively with non-saproxylic richness. BCC and BCW values for saproxylic species were positively correlated with distance from the city centre. For non-saproxylic species, BCW values were negatively correlated with distance from adjacent areas. These results suggest that saproxylic beetles require large areas covered by forest, but are not strongly influenced by isolation, which is important for non-saproxylic species. Non-saproxylic tenebrionids have limited dispersal capabilities, which explains their sensitivity to isolation, but are generally eurytopic species frequently found even in the city centre. By contrast, most saproxylic species are able to fly, but are mainly found in peripheral areas with large and relatively well preserved forest fragments. Maintaining and possibly enhancing connectivity among green spaces is important for the conservation of non-saproxylic species, whereas preserving large forest surfaces, especially in peripheral areas, is needed for the conservation of saproxylic species.",10.1007/s10841-016-9900-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983410218&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-016-9900-z&partnerID=40&md5=0ca816bbcf4894d1928727a705a7e038,20,2,"role of urban green spaces for saproxylic beetle conservation: a case study of tenebrionids in rome, italy",10.1007/s10841-016-9900-z,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-016-9900-z/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-016-9900-z

For the past fifteen years this expansion has also affected the lowlands of the Geneva basin. When entering the Plateau area, the red deer face a landscape highly fragmented by urbanisation. In addition their natural habitats are broken up and are often reduced to small patches. In this context it is hard to imagine how a red deer population manages to find all the resources required for survival, and how the animals manage to connect the scattered habitats in their area. A study was initiated in 2009 in order to assess this population's use of the space available. Sixteen individuals were fitted with GPS collars in order to monitor their movements. The results show that these individuals manage to connect a set of habitats, forests and agricultural areas, thanks to the presence of transit corridors, the whole system forming a network superposed on the urban network. It was however observed that the functionality of these corridors is often threatened and that their size has been reduced in the last decade. However, even though the landscape matrix is dominated by agricultural environments and is strongly fragmented, the animals are, at present, able to find enough resources by moving between habitat patches using the network which remains.

The rapid sprawl of urban settings often comprises a drastic landscape transformation due to the replacement of natural vegetation by impervious surfaces. However, cities can serve as critical refuges for some native fauna, particularly for pollinators. Here we used citizen data to contrast the structure of hummingbird-plant meta-networks across different greenspaces (natural protected areas, urban parks, urban gardens and street trees areas) in a tropical megacity. We compiled hummingbird-plant visitation records in Mexico City available in two citizen science resources: iNaturalist and eBird. We first determined whether the retrieved dataset was representative to estimate network metrics by calculating sample coverage and estimating species richness in different greenspaces. Then, we characterized network structure and plant importance for network organization according to plant origin, life form and pollination syndrome. We recorded 17 hummingbirds visiting 84 plant species, encompassing a total of 742 interactions. Natural protected areas and urban parks showed a higher richness of hummingbirds and plants. All networks had low levels of connectance, specialization, and nestedness. Modularity was significant across all networks with higher values in natural protected areas and urban gardens. Native and introduced plant species showed a similar contribution to network organization. Non-ornithophilous plants were most important in natural protected areas, while tree species were most important in street trees greenspaces. Our results provide evidence of generalization of hummingbird-plant networks in urban areas. Introduced species and nonornithophilous plants were equally important for hummingbirds, suggesting an integration of alien plants with no specialized bird pollination traits into ecological networks in urban scenarios.

Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban environments.

Urbanization significantly affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species richnesss in urban environments.

The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to find out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterflies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterfly species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterfly population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7-36% for 'moderate dispersers' and 19-56% for 'good dispersers'. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive influence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world.

Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps. Results The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites. Conclusions This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning.",10.1007/s10980-020-01159-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099362643&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-020-01159-6&partnerID=40&md5=ef803114d169038aad40b3dd21741ce7,36,7,a multistep approach to improving connectivity and co-use of spatial ecological networks in cities,10.1007/s10980-020-01159-6,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-020-01159-6.pdf; https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/16216; https://www.scilit.net/article/25a5ae9d2ff29f7e2247d1f63260e9af?action=show-references; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-020-01159-6

This research aims to be the first one in estimating indirectly the potential urban fauna richness in Santiago. In order to achieve this, a multicriteria analysis was conducted based on five factors (human disturbance, energy present in the system, heterogeneity of land uses, complexity of land uses, and natural areas), which contribute to the fauna richness along with their respective relative weights. Thus, a potential fauna richness index (PFRI) was generated, whose mapping allowed the identification of favorable areas for the fauna richness (FAFR). In addition, the effect of a gradient of urbanization on FAFR was evaluated, the connectivity between FAFR was generated, and also the PFRI over the green areas, which belong to the urban area, was analyzed. As a result, in the urban area, the highest PFRI was displayed in the municipalities of Lampa, Lo Barnechea, Vitacura, and Penalolen, followed by San Bernardo, Puente Alto, Pudahuel, Las Condes y Quilicura. Connectivity between FAFR was located north-east of Santiago city and near the Andes. Public green areas showed a surface and a PFRI with low value, in contrast to private green areas, located north-east with the higher values. Additionally, there is no perceivable effecton the PFRI due to the gradient of urbanization. Perhaps it is because, near to the limit of the urban area, there are highly densified natural patches. Consequently, the urban areas in Santiago would not help increasing the fauna richness, being the most affected species those that inhabit in the ground. Finally, at the moment of evaluation of the fauna richness, not only a landscape study should be conducted, but also the local habitat characteristics should be incorporated, among which highlights the surface of the green areas. Also it is necessary to carry out an urban landscape planning, which leads to the connectivity between natural patches and green areas. This planning would allow the entry of fauna that circulates around urban areas, and thus would contribute to the improvement of biodiversity.",10.4067/S0716-078X2013000300004,NA,86,4,"identification of favorable areas for the vertebrate fauna richness in urban and peri-urban areas of the metropolitan region, chile",10.4067/S0716-078X2013000300004,NA

This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels. In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level.

As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards’ inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments.

These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the landscape structure of an urbanized area in the Atlantic Forest biome, using geoprocessing techniques and fundamentals of Landscape Ecology, in order to provide subsidies for forest conservation in the urban landscape. A land use/land cover map was used to quantify forest cover and to evaluate the landscape structure. Landscape metrics quantified the area, shape and proximity of the forest remnants, providing indicators of the landscape structure. Forest covers 22.9% of the study area, with only 3.6% of the fragments larger than 50 ha. The majority of the fragments (83%) has an area of less than 10 ha. Only three remnants are larger than 500 ha, the largest of them is located in Ipanema National Forest. Most forest fragments (80%) are located in particular properties. The landscape was diagnosed as highly anthropized and fragmented, but with remnants close to each other (NEAR < 50m) potentiating the movement of species in the anthropic matrix. Scenarios of exclusion of small fragments demonstrated the fragility of the matrix without their support, since the small remnants contribute to the connection between the larger ones. The anthropic grassland is the second largest land use class in the study area (20.4%), behind only the urbanized area (25%). Actions to maintain biodiversity in anthropized landscapes such as the study area should prioritize the restoration of anthropic grasslands, incentives for forest conservation in private properties and the maintenance of small fragments in the landscape, in order to promote the connection between large forest areas.

The basic idea of this method is that, in urban areas where the price of land is high, it is most cost-effective to protect linear green areas that act as ecological corridors for potential movement paths (PMPs) of wild animals. PMPs were identified by a path-finding algorithm (PFA) that selected the optimum routes with minimum travel costs between pairs of locations where individuals of the indicator species-great tits (Parus major)-were found during field surveys. The PFA created an imaginary line segment network that connects nodes separated by 30 m across the entire study area, and estimated the total travel cost of a route from one P. major location to another by summing the travel costs associated with all of the segments comprising that route. We assumed that the travel cost of each segment is the average of the inverses of the bird densities at the two end nodes. For each node, the bird density was estimated from the linear relationship between percentage vegetation cover and bird density, as observed during field surveys. The predicted PMPs showed a pattern that was highly concentrated on patches with relatively high vegetation cover. The preference of P. major for a few specific routes allowed us to easily identify ecological corridors in the study area. An ecological network plan that protects and/or restores areas along ecological corridors would greatly improve the ecological connectivity of fragmented habitats in highly urbanized areas.",10.1007/s11355-012-0194-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872672583&doi=10.1007%2fs11355-012-0194-3&partnerID=40&md5=0e06b282d2eb1ae4453104e0cf1757fc,9,5,planning an ecological network using the predicted movement paths of urban birds,10.1007/s11355-012-0194-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11355-012-0194-3

Corridors intended to facilitate the movement of multiple species could increase persistence of entire communities, but at the likely cost of being less efficient for any given species than a corridor intended specifically for that species. There have been few tests of the trade-offs between single- and multispecies corridor approaches. We assessed single-species and multispecies habitat corridors for 5 threatened mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo. We generated maps of the cost of movement across the landscape for each species based on the species' local abundance as estimated through hierarchical modeling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates. Elevation influenced local abundance of banded civets (Hemigalus derbyanus) and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus). Increased road density was associated with lower local abundance of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) and higher local abundance of sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) local abundance was lower in recently logged areas. An all-species-combined connectivity scenario with least-cost paths and 1 km buffers generated total movement costs that were 27% and 23% higher for banded civets and clouded leopards, respectively, than the connectivity scenarios for those species individually. A carnivore multispecies connectivity scenario, however, increased movement cost by 2% for banded civets and clouded leopards. Likewise, an herbivore multispecies scenario provided more effective connectivity than the all-species-combined scenario for sambar and macaques.

Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix.

To assess how isolation and degradation of protected natural areas may affect long-term conservation efforts across the range of a sensitive subspecies, we used multiscale occupancy analysis, species distribution modeling, and circuit theory to identify hotspot areas of occurrence and potential landscape connectivity among areas of high quality habitat within and between protected natural areas. Big Cypress fox squirrels (Sciurus niger avicennia: BCFS) are state-threatened subspecies of fox squirrel endemic to forested wetlands in southwest Florida, which have been highly altered by human activities. Probability of occupancy of BCFS among conservation areas varied widely due to differences in environmental features (Hedge's g = 1.4705, 95% CI: 1.074-1.763). Fine-scale features indicative of habitat degradation, such as increasing midstory vegetation cover and decreasing bromeliad cover, negatively influenced BCFS occurrence. Home-range-level tree canopy cover differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to urban areas. Additionally, home-range-level high summer temperature differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to cypress domes. Habitat was distributed patchily both within and among conservation areas, separated by large areas of unsuitable vegetation communities and urbanized features that were barriers to movement.

In this study, we assessed how urbanization affects polypore species richness and the number of red-listed polypore species in forest stands, and the occurrences of polypore species on individual units of dead wood. Spruce-inhabiting polypore assemblages and their associations to urbanization, local habitat connectivity and dead-wood abundance were investigated in southern Finland. The effects of urbanization on polypore species richness and individual species were largely negligible when other environmental variability was accounted for. Several red-listed polypore species were found in deadwood hotspots of urban forests, though urbanization had a marginally significant negative effect on their richness. The main driver of total species richness was dead-wood abundance while the number of red-listed species was also strongly dependent on local habitat connectivity, implying that a high degree of fragmentation can decrease their occurrence in urban forests. We conclude that the highest potential for providing habitats for threatened species in the urban context lies in large peri-urban recreational forests which have been preserved for recreational purposes around many cities.

The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is a ground dwelling mammal which also inhabits variable urban habitats. We investigated habitat connectivity and the spatial genetic structure of urban hedgehogs in the largest Swiss city. We addressed the following questions: i) At the city-scale, which prominent landscape elements affect the spatial distribution of genetic clusters? ii) Which landscape elements affect gene flow in an urban mammal within the clusters? iii) Does individual movement data improve the prediction of landscape-wide gene flow? We used two Bayesian methods to examine the influence of water bodies and major traffic routes on genetic hedgehog clusters, using microsatellite data of 147 hedgehogs. Further, we used extensive movement data to parameterise single-path and multi-path connectivity models, which were then used to predict genetic distance between hedgehog individuals. First, we found that both Bayesian methods consistently showed three distinct genetic clusters, separated by the main rivers and the parallel running transportation axes. Second, the best model indicates that gene flow was facilitated by urban green areas and hampered by all other land cover types. Third, multi-path models based on detailed GPS movement data clearly outperformed models based on a priori assumptions to predict gene flow. Multi-path connectivity models based on movement data reveal to be a powerful tool to detect gene flow in highly fragmented habitats and could be a crucial step in implementing effective conservation measures.

To this end, there is a need to understand the drivers governing infiltration of wildlife into cities. In this paper we study the availability and distribution of food resources in urban areas as driver of wild boar movement patterns. Based on the optimal foraging theory, we utilize an agent-based simulation model to investigate the ever-growing infiltration of wild boars into some cities. We apply the model to an artificial city that mimics the landscape of the city of Haifa. Manipulating food availability and relative resistance costs of different land-covers we demonstrate that infiltration of boars depends on population size of wild boars and on the amount and spatial distribution of attractors (e.g., food). Model outputs for likely sets of parameters demonstrate good correspondence to the reports of boar observations within the city of Haifa, Israel, where the porosity of the urban fabric and the connectivity of open space patches provide a trail network that makes food throughout the city accessible at a relatively low search-cost. Our results indicate that land cover and food patterns determine critically boars' foraging movement and infiltration into the city.

Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer. Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P elatior placed within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent. Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with most dye transfer events at short distances (80% at less than 15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602 m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already existed. Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and habitat.

Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we iden-tified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of 'stepping stone' habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115254,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129942426&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115254&partnerID=40&md5=b7a4042c6325195e14416e97117267bd,316,5,reconciling cities with nature: identifying local blue-green infrastructure interventions for regional biodiversity enhancement,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115254,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129942426&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115254&partnerID=40&md5=b7a4042c6325195e14416e97117267bd

However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators.",10.1002/ecs2.2486,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/15804/; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2486,9,5,estimates of accessible food resources for pollinators in urban landscapes should take landscape friction into account,10.1002/ecs2.2486,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/15804/; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2486

Citizen science data have been proven to be useful to address conservation issues in urban areas, especially where knowledge is lacking about species richness and habitat preferences. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul, with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities, and what parts of the city facilitated habitat connectivity. We found that the most suitable habitats for multiple families were located in public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. These results are directly applicable in order to better understand urban planning stakes for pollinators and wildlife in general and provide avenues for improvement to recreate functional greenways in a dense city like Seoul. The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas.

The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the,urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales.

Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250 m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident.

In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on ""quality-function-structure"" was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the ""quality-function-structure"" of WUA in 2020.

The approach identifies potential priority corridors for ecological connectivity networks. The study combined circuit models, connectivity analysis and least-cost models to identify potential corridors by integrating structure and function of green space patches to provide reliable ecological connectivity network models in the cities. Relevant parameters such as landscape resistance and green space structure (vegetation density, patch size and patch distance) were derived from an expert and literature-based approach based on the preference of bird behaviour. The integrated models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species using different measures of green space structure revealing the potential corridors and least-cost pathways for both bird species at the patch sites. The implementation of improvements to the identified corridors could increase the connectivity of green space.

Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes. Methods Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type. Results We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity.

For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness.

In fragmented landscapes, species are not only affected by patch-level attributes but also by the influence of the whole mosaic of landscape elements surrounding habitat patches. Therefore, it is important to understand the simultaneous effects of local and landscape-level attributes on biodiversity. In this study, we determined the influence of landscape context on species richness of forest mammals in an urban-forest mosaic of the EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. We determined presence/absence of mammals in 28 patches using remote-triggered camera traps over two sampling periods. We applied generalised linear modelling within an information-theoretic framework to quantify the effects of within-patch, isolation, matrix, and landscape level attributes on species richness. The results showed the importance of landscape context for occurrence patterns of mammals in fragmented landscapes. In particular, they showed that patch size, shape complexity, habitat amount in the immediate environment, habitat proximity and road density were the most important factors influencing mammalian richness patterns. Overall, the results stressed the importance of habitat area (patch size, habitat amount in the immediate environment, and habitat proximity) and its spatial configuration to faunal preservation and suggest that management efforts in this landscape should be aimed at protecting fragments from further loss and disturbance and matrix improvement to increase landscape connectivity.

We used 16 microsatellite loci to genotype 374 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from the city of Berlin and surrounding rural regions in Brandenburg in order to study genetic structure and dispersal behaviour of a mobile carnivore across the urban-rural landscape. We assessed functional connectivity by applying an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. Three commonly used genetic distance measures yielded different model selection results, with only the results of an eigenvector-based multivariate analysis reasonably explaining genetic differentiation patterns. Genetic clustering methods and landscape resistance modelling supported the presence of an urban population with reduced dispersal across the city border. Artificial structures (railways, motorways) served as main dispersal corridors within the cityscape, yet urban foxes avoided densely built-up areas. We show that despite their ubiquitous presence in urban areas, their mobility and behavioural plasticity, foxes were affected in their dispersal by anthropogenic presence. Distinguishing between man-made structures and sites of human activity, rather than between natural and artificial structures, is thus essential for better understanding urban fox dispersal.

However, much of this research has been conducted in forestry and agricultural environments, with little research in urban areas. In this study, field surveys were conducted measuring the impact of fragmentation on bird, frog, plant and fungi species richness, within the fragmented urban landscape of southern Sydney. Of all fragmentation parameters examined, remnant area was the best and most significant predictor of species richness for all taxa studied. Remnant size thresholds, below which biodiversity declined rapidly, were observed at approximately 4 ha for bird and frog species richness and approximately 2 ha for plant and fungal species richness. A further threshold appears to exist at approximately 50 ha for the dominance of forest interior species. Further relationships were also observed for perimeter:area ratio, indicating the influence of various edge effects on all taxa. Isolation effects were observed in the form of an inverse linear relationship between distance to other large reserves and species richness for fungi, birds and frogs. Corridor connectivity also produced an overall positive relationship for birds, frogs and plants. It is concluded that the identification of fragmentation thresholds and relationships provides an important management toot for the design of networks aimed at conserving biodiversity in fragmented urban environments.

Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens.

Habitats as small as an individual tree may provide important landscape linkages across a densely urbanized city. Thus there is a need for micro-scale inventories of whole cities, which should incorporate not just biomass, but also vegetation of different life form, to support different habitat structural requirements. A combination of fine resolution multispectral satellite images from Ikonos, with the image processing technique of Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) permits the identification of different types of urban vegetation at sub-pixel level. Any fractional amount of grass and/or trees respectively within each 4 m Ikonos pixel can be identified. To evaluate such fine scale inventory, least cost path (LCP) analysis was performed using pixel fractions representing micro-scale tree habitats. This study adopts an innovative approach by allocating variable weightings to the vegetation fraction amounts within each pixel, rather than to whole pixels. The result is a fuzzy friction surface, which constitutes a very high-resolution database for input to fuzzy querying and decision-making. The friction values represent species' preferences or tolerance levels, and may be varied according to the fraction amounts within a pixel. Automated mapping of least cost pathways over different friction surfaces produced different routes across the study area, the densely urbanized Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong.

To fill this gap, we developed a novel method to map fine-scale ALAN pollution patterns in urban bird habitats using high spatial resolution ALAN satellite data. First, an ALAN pollution map was derived from JL1-3B satellite images. Then, the core habitat nodes (CHNs) representing the main habitats for urban birds to inhabit were identified from the land cover map, which was produced using Gaofen2 (GF2) data, and the high probability corridors (HPCs), indicating high connectivity paths, were derived from Circuitscape software. Finally, the ALAN patterns in the CHNs and HPCs were analysed, and the mismatch index was proposed to evaluate the trade-off between human activity ALAN demands and ALAN supply for the protection of urban birds. The results demonstrated that 115 woodland patches covering 4149.0 ha were selected as CHNs, and most of the CHNs were large urban parks or scenic spots located in the urban fringe. The 2923 modelled HPCs occupying 1179.2 ha were small remaining vegetation patches and vegetated corridors along the major transport arteries. The differences in the ALAN pollution patterns between CHNs and HPCs were mainly determined by the characteristics of the green space patches and the light source types. The polluted regions in the CHNs were clustered in a few regions that suffered from concentrated and intensive ALAN, while most of the CHNs remained unaffected. In contrast, the 727 HPCs were mainly polluted by street lighting was scattered and widely distributed, resulting a more varying influence to birds than that in the CHNs. Relating patterns of the ALAN to bird habitats and connectivity provides meaningful information for comprehensive planning to alleviate the disruptive effects of ALAN pollution.

Many plant species rely on pollinators to move pollen between populations. In urban areas, insufficient pollinator services may result in limited gene flow, which can have negative consequences such as genetic drift and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, restored populations that are established with few founders of low genetic diversity may have limited long-term population persistence. Here, we tested the hypotheses that populations of a self-compatible forb established on urban green roofs from nursery stock are genetically depauperate and that limited gene (pollen) flow between populations will result in increased inbreeding. We compared the neutral genetic diversity of Penstemon hirsutus, using nine microsatellite loci, between three green roof populations established from nursery stock and three natural populations. We also established ten experimental populations on green roofs and measured rates of outcrossing and inbreeding and identified the movement of pollen within and between roofs using a paternity analysis. We found that neutral genetic diversity of populations established from nursery stock was lower than that of natural populations, although the level of inbreeding was also lower on the green roofs. In our experimental populations, we found that the rates of outcrossing and inbreeding varied between the roof populations.

We inventoried the total pteridophyte diversity in 82 forest patches of the Hochelaga Archipelago (Montreal area, Quebec, Canada), and evaluated their level of integrity using landscape metrics (e.g., area, connectivity, matrix composition) calculated from satellite imagery and land use maps. To obtain information at microhabitat scale, we sampled pteridophyte diversity, as well as biotic and abiotic data, in 225 sample plots within these 82 patches. Relationships of pteridophyte richness to landscape metrics and to microhabitat variables were analyzed with parsimonious regression models. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the effects of each group of variables (forest area, land use, biotic/abiotic and edge effect). To enhance the interpretation of models involving richness, distance-based redundancy analyses of species composition data were performed. Indicator species of low and high levels of urban influence were then identified using the IndVal method. Results showed a strong species-area relationship that was influenced by surrounding land use. Pteridophyte richness decreased with increasing proportions of residential areas, urban heat islands (UHI) and water bodies in a 500 m-buffer zone around patches. Greater richness at the microhabitat scale was associated to greater distance from internal and external edges. Out of 38 species, 19 were significant indicators of low levels of urban influence. We conclude that pteridophytes are positive indicator of forest integrity, since they demonstrate typical plant responses to adverse urban-generated ecological conditions. Green-spored species are of particular interest, since their presence indicates low levels of UHIs. Impact of global climate changes on biodiversity can be predicted by studying UHls, and we suggest using pteridophytes in this broader context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, some mesocarnivores have adapted to the urban and suburban environment. The response of small carnivores to urbanization is poorly studied, partly due to methodological difficulties. We assessed the impact of urbanization on a representative of small carnivores - the least weasel Mustela nivalis. Data from 254 trapping sessions of monitoring small mammals (27 810 trap-days) conducted in different urbanized and non-urbanized habitats (Poland, Central Europe) were used and analysed in a logistic regression model. The probability of occurrence of weasels was tested in relation to the land cover type, abundance of rodents (weasel's food base), proportion of a built-up area (on the 500 m radius buffer) and trapping effort. The weasel avoided urban areas and if the percentage of a built-up area was higher than 32% the probability of occurrence of the weasel was low (P < 0.5). Within urbanized areas, least weasel were only detected on the outskirts of a city or in the valleys of large rivers. Conversely, habitat type did not predict the presence of least weasel in non-urbanized areas. The possible reasons for the lack of the weasel in urban green areas are narrow food specialization (mainly rodents as prey; no use of anthropogenic food sources), high energetic demands, and fragmentation and isolation of green areas. Despite the high ecological plasticity of this species, the strong negative response of the least weasel to urbanization causes that their occurrence can be an indicator of well-planned urban greenery. The occurrence of the least weasel indicates both the functional connectivity of green areas in the city and the abundance and availability of the prey base - ground-dwelling animals from lower trophic groups.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061573692&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2019.02.016&partnerID=40&md5=30a36e61c703c49883939bb19433c30b,101,3,are small carnivores urban avoiders or adapters: can they be used as indicators of well-planned green areas?,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.016,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6331558; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X19301256

However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex. Objectives The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs. Methods We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of P. major and C. caeruleus at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance). Results We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies. Conclusions This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision.

Most established populations of this species are showing a clear trend of territorial expansion and numerical growth. Recent reviews highlighted that one of the main impacts by alien ring-necked parakeets is the competition with threatened bat species using trunk cavities as roosts. In Italy, the only known reproductive population of Nyctalus bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) occurs in an urban area in the central part of the country, surrounded by increasing and expanding populations of ring-necked parakeets. In this work, we updated the population status of both ring-necked and Alexandrine parakeets and breeding noctule bats in the region. Then, we ran a species distribution model using Maxent software to analyze the environmental suitability of the region for the ring-necked parakeet and a connectivity model using Circuitscape software to predict the possibility of its expansion in the area occupied by breeding noctule bats. We recorded a high number of individual parakeets and breeding colonies, together with a remarkable noctule population decline, from about 400 to about 120 individuals, in the last 20 years, possibly due to urban green management practices. Although some ring-necked parakeets have already been observed in the study area, there is no evidence of reproduction in the surroundings of the noctule colony. However, our model showed a high environmental suitability for the ring-necked parakeet in the area occupied by breeding noctules. As well, the connectivity model showed the potential for a direct flow of individuals from the main urban centers to the area used by noctule bats. The arrival of alien parakeets to the area occupied by the bat breeding colony should be tightly monitored by surveying the suitable areas for this bird, as well as the identified ecological corridors.

Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities.

A group of species such as Sturnus cineraceus and Columba livia were more frequently observed in sparser woodlands. These species are not typically categorized as woodland species, and they preferred mixed habitat of tree-covered vegetation and open areas. The birds of another group, including Streptopelia orientalis and Lanius bucephalus, which tend to use tree crowns as foraging habitat were more frequently observed in the woodlands surrounded by agricultural areas rather than in those surrounded by urbanized areas. This could be because those species can move across agricultural areas, but not urban areas, so that the effect of woodland isolation is not very remarkable for them when agricultural areas surrounded woodlands. On the other hand, some species preferred open area to vegetated area. A mixture of open space and woodlands would result in woodlands of reduced value for these woodland birds.

A key part of guaranteeing that cities meet Goal 11 is to ensure equitable access to urban green spaces, and the biodiversity that they support, for all residents. However, there is evidence from developed world cities of a Luxury Effect, where wealthier residents have greater access to urban biodiversity than poorer residents. To test for this Luxury Effect in a developing world city, we measured bird species richness and diversity in 27 urban green spaces in Johannesburg, South Africa, to examine how socio-economic and ecological drivers influence urban biodiversity. We found no evidence of a Luxury Effect with the median income of neighbourhoods surrounding the green spaces having no significant effect on bird richness or diversity. There were, however, ecological effects with surrounding natural land-cover negatively correlated to richness, and a positive influence of wetland connectivity on richness. The negative effect of natural land-cover is possibly due to the relatively low bird diversity of the natural grasslands surrounding Johannesburg.

The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis's Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the ""Gran Area Metropolitana"", which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat used by this species (coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: To determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for this species in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species' range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi, and implement a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts.",10.15517/RBT.V69I1.41742,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099028178&doi=10.15517%2fRBT.V69I1.41742&partnerID=40&md5=d44865ce62244e1d8c3b1a1215566983,69,3,"urbanization, habitat extension and spatial pattern, threaten a costa rican endemic bird",10.15517/RBT.V69I1.41742,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099028178&doi=10.15517%2fRBT.V69I1.41742&partnerID=40&md5=d44865ce62244e1d8c3b1a1215566983

Yet, landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and greenspace management practices may limit a city's conservation potential. We examined how landscape configuration, composition, and local patch quality influenced insect nesting success across inner-city Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.), a postindustrial legacy city containing a high abundance of vacant land (over 1600 ha). Here, 40 vacant lots were assigned 1 of 5 habitat treatments (T1, vacant lot; T2, grass lawn; T3, flowering lawn; T4, grass prairie; and T5, flowering prairie), and we evaluated how seeded vegetation, greenspace size, and landscape connectivity influenced cavity-nesting bee and wasp reproduction. Native bee and wasp larvae were more abundant in landscapes that contained a large patch (i.e., >6 ha) of contiguous greenspace, in habitats with low plant biomass, and in vacant lots seeded with a native wildflower seed mix or with fine-fescue grass, suggesting that fitness was influenced by urban landscape features and habitat management. Our results can guide urban planning by demonstrating that actions that maintain large contiguous greenspace in the landscape and establish native plants would support the conservation of bees and wasps.

The presence or absence was recorded for each species in landscapes that varied in landscape and site level attributes. Landscapes were classified into three categories based on their level of urbanisation. Broad comparisons across the landscapes were used to determine species specific response to increasing levels of urbanisation. Site level attributes were modelled to predict the patch occupancy for each species in each of the landscape types. Two broad trends were identified: the superb fairy wren (Malurus cyaneus) and white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) displayed a tolerance to urbanisation and the eastern yellow robin (Eosaltrica australis) and white throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus) demonstrated a threshold response to urbanisation. The density of roads (-ve) and the extent of tree cover (+ve) in a landscape were highly correlated with the occurrence of urban sensitive species while at the site level the density of roads and density of rivers were the strongest contributors to their presence. The marked differences in the isolation and connectivity of patches where the threshold for urban sensitive species ceases are the likely contributors to their decline and sensitivity to suburban habitats. Conservation and management of urban sensitive species is largely dependant on the way urban development is managed. Of critical importance is careful planning in urban-fringe environments.

The effect of land cover change on genetic differentiation may vary among taxa; mobile birds may be least affected. Regardless, genetic differentiation between populations should be best predicted by measures of distance that incorporate the effect of land cover on movement. We studied the relationship between land cover and genetic differentiation in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at eighteen sites in the Seattle metropolitan region. We generated a series of hypothetical ""resistance surfaces"" based on land cover and development age, calculated ""resistance distances"" between pairs of sampling sites, and related them to pairwise genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation was best described by a multiple regression model where resistance to gene flow (1) linearly increased with age of development and (2) was greater in high- and medium-density urbanization than in native forest land cover types (R (2) = 0.15; p = 0.003). The single variable with the highest correlation with genetic differentiation was derived from a linear relationship between development age and resistance (R (2) = 0.08; p = 0.007). Our results thus suggested that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. However, the relation of development age to genetic differentiation suggested that equilibrium was not yet reached. Hence, the effects of lost connectivity will increase.

It is well-known that different elements of the landscape matrix provide different levels of permeability to species moving across the landscape, but such effects may be species-specific. Whilst the spatial articulation of connectivity corridors is highly dependent on how we define them, and which species group we intended to provide connectivity for, it is also important to understand the optimal land cover mix to promote the maximum number of species. We demonstrate an approach to (1) identifying multispecies networks and examine how it compares to previous network approaches for a case study city of Sheffield, UK and (2) developing specific proposals for how green networks in Sheffield could be improved. We modelled least-cost corridors for four bird, three mammal and three reptile species. After validating the derived corridors, we created a union of least-cost corridors that identified the multispecies connectivity zones and compared the derived multispecies networks with the pre-existing networks (Sheffield City Council - the Green Network and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust- the Living Don ecological network). We found that a particular mix of land covers (particularly, woodlands, mixed vegetation and unimproved grassland) have a high potential to provide corridors for the maximum number of species around the edges of the city centre or the suburbs. A significant proportion of the Green Network and the Living Don ecological network coincide spatially with these land covers. Based on the comparisons of the derived and existing corridors, we discuss specific proposals for how Sheffield green networks could be improved and which areas to prioritise.

Environmental alterations caused by urbanization, such as land conversion and isolation of natural patches, favour tolerant and generalist species, causing both species loss and replacement. In addition, selective pressure is exerted on particular functionaltraits, driving a functional homogenization or turnover of biotic communities. We sampled ground arthropods within the municipality of Turin (NW-Italy), wherein an isolated and a connected control subplot were repeatedly sampled at 15 stations distributed along a gradient of increasing urbanization. Such a nested sampling design allowed us to investigate the taxonomic and the functional responses of carabids and spiders to both the urbanization level and patch isolation. First, we highlighted the dominant role played by species homogenization (nestedness) in explaining both taxonomic and functional variation in both groups of arthropods. Secondly, we showed that urbanization causes simultaneously functional homogenization and replacement in both carabid and spider assemblages, whereas patch isolation influences carabid species composition and homogenizes and shifts spider taxonomic and functional composition. Lastly, by relating community-weighted means of body length, dispersal capacity and trophic strategy to the urbanization and isolation gradients, we demonstrated that urbanization alters the trophic structure of both taxonomic groups and increases the average dispersal capacity of spiders. On the other hand, patch isolation affected the functional composition of spiders only, reducing the body size and increasing dispersal capacity and the proportion of web-builder species. Our results demonstrate that both urbanization and patch isolation alter species composition by causing functional and taxonomic homogenization. In addition, they exert a strong filtering effect on community functional traits, increasing the proportion of phytophagous species in carabids, and increasing dispersal capacity and web-builders occurrence in spiders, while reducing spider body size.

However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres.

In urban landscapes, animal movement is generally impacted by varying levels of increased urbanization. However, this is species dependent and is mostly guided by the surrounding habitat. Fragmentation and habitat patch isolation must be considered at scales appropriate to the study species. Using telemetry, we test these assumptions investigating movement patterns of flocks of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso; RTBC) between three regions: urban, peri-urban, and forest using GPS and satellite PTT. This species occurs at varying levels of urbanization, however, how this might affect its movements is largely unknown. We did not find evidence that RTBC movement was impaired in the urban region compared with peri-urban or forest regions. It found, however, a significant within-region variation in movement extent among flocks and across regions depending on foraging resource availability and location. Differences in daily movement distance (Av. 4.96 - 16.41 km) and home range size (6.02 - 52.57 km(2)) between urban flocks appeared to be associated with the proximity of green spaces as roosts and foraging sites, with roadside vegetation providing important foraging resources and movement corridors. Key urban habitats were predominantly located in public nature reserves and private properties, with roadside vegetation connecting these sites for RTBC. The findings of this study highlight that conservation management for this and many other threatened species should regard the urban landscape as a critical habitat for urban adapted species. This would include management of its green spaces with connectivity and offsets from roads in mind.

We used remote-sensor camera traps and global positioning system collars to identify the movement patterns of African elephants Loxondonta africana through narrow, urban corridors in Botswana. The corridors were in three types of human-dominated land-use designations with varying levels of human activity: agricultural, industrial and open-space recreational land. We found that elephants used the corridors within all three land-use designations and we identified, using a model selection approach, that season, time of day and rainfall were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors.

However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

Remnant habitats in urban areas can be especially prone to degradation by human activities at short time scales, and poor planning during urban expansion can erode their structural and functional connectivity. Foredunes in particular are threatened significantly by human activities, including coastal urban infrastructure expansion, by bulldozing them and/or by interrupting their continuity across the shoreline, and also by associated light pollution. However, there is still scarce quantification about how urban processes determine changes in remnant habitat extent and modify the configuration of structural connectivity in coastal urban settings. Using an expanding conurbation located in north-central Chile (similar to 29 degrees S) as model system, we investigated the rate of coastal foredune loss and spatial fragmentation due to urban expansion, and the change in the type of structural connectivity, i.e. with other natural habitats vs with urban infrastructure. Based on map analyses of structural connectivity among habitats and with urban infrastructure through time, we estimated foredune habitat extent and fragmentation and their shared border with other habitats and built infrastructure during two time intervals, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020. Distribution and intensity of light pollution on present foredunes were also quantified in situ through field sampling. We found 36 % decline in foredune area and increase in their connection with urban infrastructure. Urban wetlands and parallel dunes also experienced persistent area loss and increase in connection with urban infrastructure. Light pollution was intense in the foredune-beach ecotone.

Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal.

Results Exotic dominance reduced alpha diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages.

A high-resolution mapping of forest patches was used to quantify forest cover and to provide spatial analysis. We developed a Forest Conservation Priority Index (FCPI) derived from landscape metrics to select priority areas for forest conservation efforts. We used area, shape and proximity metrics as landscape structure indicators. Landscape metrics were classified and we attributed a rank and weights for them to calculate the FCPI. Forest covers 17% of the study area. 60% of the forest patches comprise less than one hectare, 95% less than 10 ha and only 1% more than 50 ha. The largest fragments (> 100ha) are all long and narrow. Also, fewer than half the patches are connected to others. Regions classified as high and very high priority for forest conservation are localized at greater slopes, along rivers and on private lands.

However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with effective distances between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians.

Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of ecologically generalised species.

Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency.

Surprisingly, urbanisation was not related to any diversity measure. Yet, taxonomic and functional diversity in bee communities, and proportion of endangered bee species, responded negatively to the isolation of grasslands within the urban matrix-but positively to flower coverage. Urbanisation, previous restoration efforts and site type filtered the functional composition of bee communities in terms of species traits related to diet and nesting.

In general, two different patterns of urban colonization have been proposed: 1) the model of independent colonization predicts that birds colonize cities independently in different geographical regions; 2) the model of leapfrog colonization assumes a single colonization event, while additional urban populations are established from the initial urban populations. The aim of this paper was to determine the pattern of urban colonization in a common waterbird, the Eurasian coot Fulica atra. For this purpose, we analysed microsatellite variation in three pairs of urban and rural coot populations from central Poland. We found that a newly-established urban population was genetically more similar to neighbouring rural populations than to long-established urban populations, as indicated by the analysis of fixation index, genetic distance and Bayesian assignment of individuals to genetic clusters. These results are consistent with the model of independent colonization, where neighbouring rural populations are a source of individuals that colonize new urban areas. However, our analysis also showed significant differentiation between long-established urban populations and adjacent rural populations, suggesting that genetic connectivity between two types of habitat decreases with increasing time since urbanization.

Such landscape changes threaten many arboreal and gliding mammals by limiting their movements through treeless parts of a landscape and by making the landscape surrounding suitable habitat patches more inhospitable. Here, we investigate the effects of landscape structure and habitat availability on the home-range use and movement patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) at different spatial and temporal scales. We followed radio-tagged individuals in a partly urbanized study area in Eastern Finland, and analysed how landscape composition and connectivity affected the length and speed of movement bursts, distances moved during one night, and habitat and nest-site use. Results: The presence of urban habitat on movement paths increased both movement lengths and speed whereas nightly distances travelled by males decreased with increasing amount of urban habitat within the home range. The probability of switching from the present nest site to another nest site decreased with increasing distance among the nest sites, but whether the nest sites were connected or unconnected by forests did not have a clear effect on nest switching. Flying squirrels preferred to use mature forests for their movements at night. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the proximity to urban habitats modifies animal movements, possibly because animals try to avoid such habitats by moving faster through them. Urbanization at the scale of an entire home range can restrict their movements. Thus, maintaining a large enough amount of mature forests around inhabited landscape fragments will help protect forest specialists in urban landscapes.

From surveys conducted in 68 fragments, bandicoots were found to be present in 33 (49%) despite widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 13 measured independent variables, functional connectivity was the only factor that significantly predicted the presence of bandicoots within fragments, with connectivity positively correlated with the likelihood of occupation. Functional connectivity was equated to the likelihood of bandicoot immigration into the focal fragment from the nearest occupied fragment, based on the estimated resistance to movement offered by the intervening matrix. Within Brisbane, riparian habitat fragments typically have a relatively high level of functional connectivity, as thin strips of vegetation fringing waterways serve as corridors between larger riparian areas and facilitate the movement of bandicoots between patches. Analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion revealed that the optimal model based on landscape context variables was convincingly better supported by the data than the optimal model produced from fragment characteristics. However, it is important to examine both internal attributes of habitat fragments and external features of the surrounding landscape when modelling the distribution of ground-dwelling fauna in urban environments, or other landscapes with a highly variable matrix.

The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on ""citizen science"" data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds.

I compared the effects of site area, connectivity, vegetation condition and habitat resources on the presence, abundance and total number of species of butterflies and day-flying moths within 46 urban fragments of remnant vegetation in south-west Western Australia. Site area and vegetation condition were the dominant determinants of species presence: large sites with more undisturbed vegetation favoured 16 of 20 native species and only one (Geitoneura minyas) benefited from disturbance. Another nine species that were not sufficiently widespread or abundant to enable individual analysis were collectively more prevalent in larger sites. Resource quality and quantity dominated the patterns of site occupancy, consistent with habitat resources, not metapopulation effects, determining current distribution patterns. The total number of species at each site reflected the collective responses of the individual species: increasing with area and declining with vegetation disturbance. The effects of area and vegetation condition were not simply additive: disturbance had a far greater impact on small remnants.

These barriers appear often unsurmountable (e.g., rivers, highways, fences) and thus hinder contact between hedgehogs, leading to genetic isolation. In our study we tested whether these barriers affect the hedgehog population of urban Berlin, Germany. As Berlin has many of these barriers, we were expecting a strong genetic differentiation among hedgehog populations. However, when we looked at unrelated individuals, we did not see genetic differentiation among populations. The latter was only detected when we included related individuals too, a 'family clan' structure that is referred to as gamodemes. We conclude that the high percentage of greenery in Berlin provides sufficient habitat for hedgehogs to maintain connectivity across the city. We use the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a mammal with limited mobility, as a model species to study whether the structural matrix of the urban environment has an influence on population genetic structure of such species in the city of Berlin (Germany). Using ten established microsatellite loci we genotyped 143 hedgehogs from numerous sites throughout Berlin. Inclusion of all individuals in the cluster analysis yielded three genetic clusters, likely reflecting spatial associations of kin (larger family groups, known as gamodemes). To examine the potential bias in the cluster analysis caused by closely related individuals, we determined all pairwise relationships and excluded close relatives before repeating the cluster analysis. For this data subset (N = 65) both clustering algorithms applied (Structure, Baps) indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. These results suggest that the high proportion of green patches in the city of Berlin provides numerous steppingstone habitats potentially linking local subpopulations. Alternatively, translocation of individuals across the city by hedgehog rescue facilities may also explain the existence of only a single cluster. We therefore propose that information about management activities such as releases by animal rescue centres should include location data (as exactly as possible) regarding both the collection and the release site, which can then be used in population genetic studies.",10.3390/ani10122315,https://www.scilit.net/article/f8b8e3d008ea048a63d19c174c9d497c?action=show-references; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/12/2315/pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297373/; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/12/2315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762246,10,6,unexpected gene-flow in urban environments: the example of the european hedgehog,10.3390/ani10122315,https://www.scilit.net/article/f8b8e3d008ea048a63d19c174c9d497c?action=show-references; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/12/2315/pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297373/; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/12/2315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762246

Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus.

In 2003-2004, we surveyed butterflies and Zygaenidae moths in 21 reserves and 4 parks within the city of Prague, Czech Republic, situated from the periphery to city centre. A total of 85 species (47% of the Czech fauna of the study groups) was detected, 22 of them being of conservation concern. Ordination analyses of the local assemblages revealed that the richest sites were large, situated far from the city centre, on alkaline bedrocks, south- to southwest oriented, and hosting high numbers of vegetation types and vascular plant species. We then used generalised linear models to fit responses of individual species to the main ordination gradient, corresponding to increasing urbanisation. Out of 60 species that met criteria for the modelling, none responded positively to urbanisation. Twenty displayed negative linear response; these urban avoiders contained a surplus of mesophilous species presumably preferring rural landscapes. Further 29 species (suburban adaptable) responded in domed manners, peaking at the city periphery. Prevailing among them were xerophilous specialists inhabiting large grassland reserves at the Prague outskirts. Finally, eleven urban tolerant species did not respond to urbanisation at all, containing three highly mobile species, three xerothermophilous specialists, and five species utilising shrubs or trees and finding suitable conditions even in urban parks. Suburban adaptable butterflies apparently benefit from such suburban environments as gardens, road or railway verges, collectively increasing the connectivity of remnants of seminatural habitats. The fact that arboreal species persist even in urban parks, whereas common grassland species are absent there, implies that the quality of urban habitats might be increased by a more sensitive management of urban green spaces, such as leaving aside small temporary fallows or adapting lawns mowing schemes.",10.14411/eje.2011.030,https://www.eje.cz/artkey/eje-201102-0008_How_to_increase_the_value_of_urban_areas_for_butterfly_conservation_A_lesson_from_Prague_nature_reserves_and_p.php; http://www.eje.cz/doi/10.14411/eje.2011.030.html,108,2,how to increase the value of urban areas for butterfly conservation? a lesson from prague nature reserves and parks,10.14411/eje.2011.030,https://www.eje.cz/artkey/eje-201102-0008_How_to_increase_the_value_of_urban_areas_for_butterfly_conservation_A_lesson_from_Prague_nature_reserves_and_p.php; http://www.eje.cz/doi/10.14411/eje.2011.030.html

Both demographic (stochasticity and the Allee effect) and genetic factors (drift load and inbreeding depression) potentially affect extinction. In fragmented populations, regular dispersal may boost population sizes (demographic rescue effect) or/and reduce the local inbreeding level and genetic drift (genetic rescue effect), which can affect extinction risks. We studied extinction processes in highly fragmented populations of the common species Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) in urban habitats exhibiting a rapid turnover of patches. A four-year demographic monitoring survey and microsatellite genotyping of individuals allowed us to study the determinants of extinction. We documented a low genetic structure and an absence of inbreeding (estimated by multilocus heterozygosity), which suggest that genetic factors were not a major cause of patch extinction. On the contrary, local population size was the main factor in extinction, whereas connectivity was shown to decrease patch extinction, which we interpreted as a demographic rescue effect that was likely due to better pollination services for reproduction.

This study focuses on analyzing factors, which affect the richness of breeding bird communities in 26 urban parks within Beijing city. A bird census and a survey of biological factors were carried out from April to November, 2012. Simultaneously, non-biological factors were examined. A path analysis based on a structural equation model was carried out to explore biological and non-biological environmental variables affecting bird communities breeding in wooded habitats. In total, 38 species of wild breeding birds were observed in the 26 parks. Based on the results, we conclude that the size of green space in parks is the most significant variable affecting bird occurrence. Green spaces surrounding a park are positive and significant factors for breeding bird communities. Wild grasses/herbs are also crucial because they maintain a high level of insects. Omnivorous bird species and birds nesting in trees did benefit by an increasing area covered by coniferous trees, by increasing richness of grass/herb species and increasing richness of woody plant species. The richness of insect communities (phytophagous and pollinating insects) has a significant effect on the richness of breeding bird communities. This study confirmed the importance of connectivity that the parks are connected to surrounding green spaces, thus forming an integrated green system avoids impervious surfaces. Proper management of coniferous woody plants, promoting wild grasses/herbs, reducing the area of planted monocultures and minimizing the use of pesticides in urban vegetation management will contribute effectively to improve the quality of breeding bird habitats in urban parks.

Characterizing varying species responses to human activity and fragmentation is important for maintaining genetic continuity in wild animals and for preserving biodiversity. As one of the only common and wide-ranging large wild herbivores in much of urban North America, deer play an important ecological role in urban ecosystems, yet the genetic impacts of development on deer are not well known.ObjectivesWe assessed genetic connectivity for mule deer to understand their genetic response to habitat fragmentation, due to development and highway barriers, in an increasingly urbanized landscape.MethodsUsing non-invasive sampling across a broad region of southern California, we investigated genetic structure among several natural areas that were separated by major highways and applied least-cost path modelling to determine if landscape context and highway attributes influence genetic distance for mule deer.ResultsWe observed significant yet variable differentiation between subregions. We show that genetic structure corresponds with highway boundaries in certain habitat patches, and that particular landscape configurations more greatly limit gene flow between patches.ConclusionsAs a large and highly mobile species generally considered to be well adapted to human activity, mule deer nonetheless showed genetic impacts of intensive urbanization.

Urban tree arrangements, in isolated tree sites or in forest patches, may alter their susceptibility to insect herbivory. Surprisingly little is known about how urban tree spatial arrangements influence pest abundance and top-down regulation by natural enemies. We sampled the abundance of an invasive pest of Eucalyptus, the psyllid Glycaspis brimblecombei, and of two of its natural enemies, the specialist exotic parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus and the generalist native predator Anthocoris nemoralis over two years. We measured insect abundances in isolated trees versus monospecific planted forest patches in 17 pairs of sites, each within a Portuguese city. The abundance of the exotic pest was three-fold higher in forest patches than in isolated trees. The parasitism rate was similar to 30 times higher in forest patches (11.5 %) than in isolated trees (0.4 %). The interdependence among insect species abundances also differed between spatial arrangements. In isolated trees, predator and parasitoid abundances depended markedly on prey abundance. In forest patches, we found a marked dependence of the predator on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Our study adds empirical data indicating that urban tree isolation matters for pest abundance and regulation by its enemies.

In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots.

Urbanization can change local habitat factors and decrease connectivity among local habitats, with major impacts on the structure of natural food webs. However, most studies have focused on single species, or compared rural to urban habitats, which do not inform us on how to design and manage cities to optimize biodiversity. To understand the local and spatial drivers of ecological communities within urban landscapes, we assessed the relative impact of local habitat factors (sunlight exposure and leaf litter) and spatial connectivity on an oak-associated herbivore community within an urban landscape. From the local habitat factors, leaf litter but not sunlight exposure was related to herbivore species richness, with leaf litter contributing to the maintenance of high species richness on isolated trees. Guilds and species differed strongly in their response to local habitat factors and connectivity, resulting in predictable variation in insect community composition among urban oaks. Taken together, our study shows an interactive effect of local and spatial factors on species richness and species composition within an urban context, with guild- and species-specific life histories determining the response of insects to urban landscapes. To maintain biodiversity in the urban landscape, preserving a dense network of local habitats is essential.

Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub Conospermum undulatum, a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained similar to 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions.

Of equal importance is the understanding of what landscape factors allow these movements to occur. We used the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), an urban apex predator in Melbourne, Australia, as a case study to understand their movement ecology in urban environments. Owl movement was recorded using automated GPS logging devices deployed on ten powerful owls, resulting in 10870 GPS locations. In combination with these positions, four environmental covariates, and a priori understanding of owl ecology were used to assign movements to three different states (prey handling/eating, foraging and transitory) based on step length and turning angles between sequential locations in a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the environmental covariate combination of time of night, Euclidean distance to riparian vegetation, and NDVI best described movement states. Owl movement states changed across the night. Shorter movements with many turns were made towards the beginning of the night in riparian areas with high NDVI. This behavior is most likely linked to prey handling, suggesting powerful owls are more likely to hunt early in the evenings and as such travel short distances while carrying large prey items. Transitory movements with limited changes in turning angles were the dominant movement state towards the end of the night. As owls leave areas of high NDVI, they quickly travel long distances across cleared land and impervious surfaces to connect to the next habitat patch where they then transition back into shorter step lengths where NDVI is higher. This research highlights the critical importance of riparian vegetation and high NDVI areas in driving powerful owl movement and foraging in urban landscapes. Conservation priority should be placed on retaining and restoring riparian corridors as areas not only for powerful owls and their prey, but also for many other species that utilize similar resources.

Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms. Objectives As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape. Methods We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity. Results We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape. Conclusions Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages.

However, the characteristics of green roofs that could enhance arthropod biodiversity and ecological functioning are poorly known, especially for South American countries. Here, we analyzed the influence of several characteristics of green roofs (plant species richness, vegetation cover of the roof, age, substrate depth, area, and isolation in terms of height and green cover in the landscape scale) on the abundance, richness (total and by functional feeding groups), and community composition of arthropods. To do that, we selected 30 green roofs located in different urbanization contexts, from small towns in semi-rural areas to Cordoba, the second-largest city of Argentina. Our results indicated a high diversity of arthropods, registering a total of 12,942 individuals corresponding to 505 species from 14 orders, being herbivores and parasitoids the dominant groups. The area of the green roofs was positively linked to total species richness, species richness of most functional feeding groups, and total abundance of arthropods. The community composition of arthropods on green roofs was also affected by their area, and by the green cover in the landscape. Moreover, green roofs with higher plant richness, mainly spontaneous, and less isolated (both vertically and horizontally) favored entomophagous arthropods. Other variables, such as age and vegetation cover of the green roofs, were also important for herbivores, predators, parasitoids and detritivores. Our study clearly demonstrates that green roof size is not all that matters for supporting arthropod biodiversity because promoting high plant diversity, allowing spontaneous ecosystem dynamics, and diminishing roof isolation foster entomophagous arthropod diversity.

The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities.

There is growing evidence that green roofs - rooftops covered with vegetation - can contribute mitigate the loss of urban green spaces by providing new habitats for numerous arthropod species. Whether green roofs can contribute to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity and increase connectivity across urbanized areas remains, however, largely unknown. Furthermore, only limited information is available on how environmental conditions shape green roof arthropod communities. We investigated the community composition of arthropods (Apidae, Curculionidae, Araneae and Carabidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 green sites at ground level in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed how the site's environmental variables (such as area, height, vegetation, substrate and connectivity among sites) affect species richness and functional diversity using generalized linear models. We used an extension of co-inertia analysis (RLQ) and fourth-corner analysis to highlight the mechanism underlying community assemblages across taxonomic groups on green roof and ground communities.

A review,Landscape and Urban Planning,"wos, scopus, pastsearch",79,"Urbanisation leads to natural habitats being fragmented with various effects according to the species and their ecological characteristics. Paradoxically, the urbanisation process creates relatively unused environments, wastelands, habitats which could contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. In this review we examined the role of wastelands in maintaining biodiversity in the city and assessed the different factors responsible for wasteland biodiversity. 37 articles were suitable for our aim. Most of the studies have been conducted in large cities in Western and Central Europe. A wasteland is defined as an abandoned site with spontaneous vegetation (i.e. wild grown vegetation). In most cases, wastelands harbour more species than other urban green spaces. The processes which affect the bio diversity of wastelands operate on two different levels. Locally, the area size, age, soil, microclimate and the vegetation structure are the dominant factors. As in other environments, the species richness increases with the size of the wasteland. Wastelands of different ages include different stages of vegetation, ranging from pioneer to pre-forest stages, and consequently harbour different communities of plants and animals. The diversity of anthropogenic soil substrates leads to different plant communities. At the landscape scale, matrix composition and geographic connectivity between wastelands influence the biodiversity of wastelands, although to a lesser extent than the local features. We show that wastelands have a real potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. At the city scale, they represent habitats which urban planners need to take into account and include in dynamic urban planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using both the taxonomic and functional diversity of semi-natural grassland plant communities, we assessed the functional connectivity of linear transportation infrastructures in urban landscape. We sampled the vegetation at 71 study sites located along the edges of two railway lines. We hypothesised that if railways favour functional connectivity, then spatially connected communities should be more similar than disconnected communities. Therefore, we compared floristic dissimilarities between site pairs that were either connected or separated by a railway spatial break (overpass or station). As a further approach, we supposed that functional connectivity may attenuate the effect of urbanisation filters on plant communities. Thus we examined whether and how edges' plant communities were influenced by urbanisation and compared our results to the patterns described in the literature. Functional connectivity was mainly maintained at railway stations, contrary to overpasses, which seemed to interrupt dispersal, demonstrating that railway edges provide connectivity for some but not all functional groups: this was only true for moderately mobile species. Surprisingly, railway edges did not seem to play an additional connective function for invasive species, the presence of which being strongly related to the urbanisation intensity and not influenced by spatial breaks along railways. Our study thus highlights the potential function of railway edges as corridors for common grassland plants. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve connectivity in urban landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We deter-mined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects meta-communities across multiple major cities. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

However, the inherent heterogeneity of cities may pose challenges for beetle dispersal from source populations, while quality of the urban environment may constrain establishment. The objective of this study was to investigate the constraints to ground-dwelling beetle community assembly in vacant lots and pocket prairies of Cleveland, Ohio using a functional trait-based approach. Functional traits with a strong predictive capacity for ecological functions were measured on beetle species collected via pitfall traps. Assembly of beetle communities was primarily constrained by dispersal limitations to colonization. Over 93% of species found within treatments were capable of flight, and functional diversity of beetle communities was higher across all treatments than expected by chance. Once beetles colonized, successful establishment was influenced by heavy metal contamination and mowing frequency, with these disturbances shaping communities based on body size, antennae length, and origin.

We use a large data set that has recorded the occurrence of two invasive bird species-the ring-necked (Psittacula krameri) and the monk (Myiopsitta monachus) parakeets-in the Iberian Peninsula from 1991 to 2016. Results Human activities and climate matching play a role on species range dynamics. Human influence and urbanization were the most relevant factors explaining colonization. Additionally, an effect of climate matching was found. Persistence (the inverse of extinction) was mainly affected by human influence for the monk parakeet and by the extent of urban environments for the ring-necked parakeet. Main conclusions Human activities play a major role not only on colonization of new locations, but also on persistence during range expansion. Additionally, natural processes-notably climate matching-also affect new colonizations. These findings add to our understanding of the mechanisms that might allow alien species to expand their geographic range at new locations and might help to improve our capacity to assess invasion risks and impacts accurately.",10.1111/ddi.13591,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134957735&doi=10.1111%2fddi.13591&partnerID=40&md5=4bedb04761540a9037954d768b5442e9,28,6,climate matching and anthropogenic factors contribute to the colonization and extinction of local populations during avian invasions,10.1111/ddi.13591,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134957735&doi=10.1111%2fddi.13591&partnerID=40&md5=4bedb04761540a9037954d768b5442e9

Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class.

While urban wildlife conservation is a rapidly developing field, the majority of conservation research has been performed in wildland areas. Understanding the applicability of wildland science to urban populations and the relative importance of factors limiting species persistence are of critical importance to identifying prescriptive management strategies for restoring wildlife to urban parks. We evaluated how habitat fragmentation, habitat quality and mortality threats influence species occupancy and persistence in urban parks. We chose California quail Callipepla californica as a representative species with potential to respond to urban conservation. We used publicly available eBird data to construct occupancy models of quail in urban parks across their native range, and present an application using focal parks interested in exploring quail reintroduction. Urban parks had a 0.23 +/- 0.02 probability of quail occupancy, with greater occupancy in larger parks that were less isolated from potential source populations, had higher shrub cover and had lower impervious cover. Less isolated parks had higher colonization rates, while larger parks had lower extinction rates. These results align with findings across urban ecology showing greater biodiversity in larger and more highly connected habitat patches. A case study highlighted that interventions to increase effective park size and improve connectivity would be most influential for two highly urban focal parks, while changes to internal land cover would have a relatively small impact. Low joint extinction probability in the parks (0.010 +/- 0.013) indicated reintroduced populations could persist for some time. Synthesis and applications. We show how eBird data can be harnessed to evaluate the responsiveness of wildlife to urban parks of variable size, connectivity and habitat quality, highlighting what management actions are most needed. Using California quail as an example, we found park size, park isolation and presence of coyotes are all important drivers of whether quail can colonize and persist in parks. Our results suggest reintroducing quail to parks could be successful provided parks are large enough to support quail, and management actions are taken to enhance regional connectivity or periodic assisted colonization is used to supplement local populations.",10.1111/1365-2664.14045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117913328&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.14045&partnerID=40&md5=eca865c892bdfcae19d6b483b9de2d60,59,5,"what makes urban parks good for california quail? evaluating park suitability, species persistence, and the potential for reintroduction into a large urban national park",10.1111/1365-2664.14045,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14045

Their associated greenspaces are important elements of the urban ecosystem, providing neighborhood ecosystem services and hosting bird populations of differing community structures compared with other urban green areas. This study analyzes avian community characteristics within residential communities and their differences compared with urban parks in Beijing. Furthermore, we assess the key environmental factors determining species composition and population sizes and the spatial scales at which these factors are most significant. We randomly selected 27 residential communities to assess the habitat structure and landscape characteristics that underpin residential avian assemblages across multiple spatial scales. Independent sample t-test and model selection methods based on AICc were used for data analysis. Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) (hereafter ETS) alone accounted for 91.0% of total individuals. Compared with urban parks, more migrants and omnivores were found in residential communities. Within-site forest patch connectivity simultaneously decided resident species diversity and individual abundance, with the exception of ETS. Tree species richness and coverage are key predictors for resident species richness and ETS numbers, respectively. Even in the most urbanized species, ETS retained ecological attributes found in ""wilder"" settings. Residential communities skewed toward avian communities with dominant numbers of ETS. In these low-quality habitats, our results suggest that landscape configuration is more important than local habitat structure. Within-site habitat connectivity and the number of surrounding forest patches with shorter between-patch distances deserve more attention in future landscape design for residential communities.

However, the extent to which traditional community assembly insights apply to spontaneous plant and trait diversity and composition on EGRs and novel ecosystems in general is unclear: (a) is a dispersal filter present because of EGRs' fragmented nature (e.g., roof height, urban environment); (b) can we confirm the strong abiotic filtering due to extreme EGR conditions (e.g., limited substrate depth); and (c) does the presence of the planted vegetation lead to biotic filtering? Location The Flanders and Brussels region of Belgium. Methods The vegetation of 129 EGRs was sampled during a field campaign. Information on local (e.g., substrate, roof height) and regional characteristics (e.g., connectivity indices) were collected and species traits were collected from multiple databases. All data were used to construct (generalized) linear mixed models that tested the effects of the dispersal-, local abiotic- and local biotic filters on plant community formation. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate predictor effects on functional composition and null models were constructed to assess trait divergence/convergence. Results Our results show that the spontaneous plant species diversity is not affected by their landscape context (dispersal filtering), while their functional composition is. Additionally, the importance of abiotic filtering is confirmed, as substrate depth and exposure have a strong impact on species diversity and decreasing substrate depth negatively impacts functional diversity. Finally, we show that biotic filtering by increased planted species cover leads to trait divergence, changes in functional composition and reduced cover of spontaneous species. Conclusions We find that a broad perspective that includes the regional and local biotic and abiotic environment is needed to assess all factors that influence the vegetation on EGRs.

As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were <20 m2 in size, however, these small patches made up only 3.4 % of total vegetation area. Species richness was significantly positively correlated with patch area. Nevertheless, taken together, small patches had similar species richness and higher beta diversity than larger patches. These small patches contribute far more than expected to overall wildflower species richness in the city - ""punching above their weight"". This held true even for less common species. However, our research indicates that connecting these patches to one another and to larger green spaces is essential to unlocking their potential as habitats and potentially allowing for the natural colonization and reinforcement of existing populations.

The occurrence and abundance of plant species were recorded in 2003 along transects in 66 settlements in a region north of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The transect routes had been established in an earlier study in 1974-81. We used ordinations to analyse species composition, fitting 10 independent variables to explain the main gradient in species composition. Additionally, socio-economic styles (derived from interviews of 1359 households) were fitted, to analyse the influence of these on plant communities. Finally, we analysed species richness by calculating independent contributions of the variables using hierarchical partitioning. Many species of neophytes have expanded their range since the 1974-81 survey, but this was not associated with a general decline of archaeophytes and natives. The main variation of species composition was along a rural to urban gradient, associated with site conditions and with socio-economic factors that vary from settlements dominated by households rooted in the local community to settlements characterized by a mobile new middle class. For neophytes, variables describing the connection to Frankfurt (distance or connectivity) were most important in predicting species richness. For archaeophytes, the data showed a positive relationship between species richness and increasing herbicide application.

Herein, the occurrence of birds in woodland remnants in three distinct landscapes was analysed to examine the effects of different types of landscape matrices on species richness vs. area and species richness vs. isolation relationships and individual species responses to woodland fragmentation. Location The study system comprised three distinct woodland landscapes of the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. These landscapes (termed agricultural, peri-urban and urban) are located within 50 km of each other, have remnant fragments of similar age, size, isolation, woodland cover, elevation and climates. The major distinguishing feature of the three landscapes was the properties of the habitats surrounding the numerous woodland remnants. Methods Bird surveys, using an area-search methodology, were conducted in 1999 and 2000 in 127 remnants in the three landscapes to determine bird species presence/absence. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, isolation and habitat complexity. To characterize differences between each landscape, we conducted an analysis of the amount of tree cover and human disturbance in each landscape using SPOT imagery and aerial photographs. Linear regressions of woodland-dependent species richness vs. remnant area and remnant isolation for the three different landscapes were calculated to see if there were any apparent differences. Binomial logistic regressions were used to determine the relationships between the occurrence of each species and the size and isolation of woodland habitat, in each landscape. Results All the landscapes displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species vs. area relationship, but the slope of the urban relationship was significantly greater than those of the other landscapes. In contrast, only the agricultural landscape displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species richness vs. isolation relationship. When individual species were investigated, we found species that were: (1) apparently insensitive to reduction in remnant area and increase in isolation across all landscapes, (2) absent in small remnants in all landscapes, (3) absent in small remnants in all landscapes and also absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, (4) absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, and (5) absent in small remnants in the urban landscape. Threshold values (50% probability of occurrence) for area and isolation for individual species were highly variable across the three landscapes. Main conclusions These results indicate that woodland bird communities have a varying response to habitat fragmentation in different landscapes. Whilst we cannot be sure how representative our chosen landscapes are of other similarly composed landscapes, these results suggest that the type of landscape matrix may have a considerable influence on how bird species are affected by woodland fragmentation in the region. For instance, the properties of a matrix may influence both the resources available in the landscape as a whole for different bird species, and the connectivity (dispersal of birds), between woodland remnants. We encourage further research that examines these hypotheses and argue that the management of the matrix should be included in conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes.",10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01256.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-13444260569&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2699.2005.01256.x&partnerID=40&md5=3865beeeea488e3e95757516acd32d10,32,3,bird community responses to habitat fragmentation: how consistent are they across landscapes?,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01256.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01256.x; https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364874

Based on the assumptions of the model, consequences of fragmentation and the vulnerability of species to habitat change can be quantified. Different species assemblages are considered to be nested perfectly, if subsets of one or more species are lost at a time as communities decline in species number and none of the species lost from the richer communities reappears in one of the species poor communities once it was lost. Nestedness is most prevalent in habitat fragments (islands) derived from a once continuous system with a common species pool that became isolated. The presence-absence matrix of species at given sites can be ordered in a way to maximize regularity. Then, the order of sites and species reflects habitat suitability of the sites and the vulnerability of a given species to fragmentation. This concept of nestedness is illustrated and used 1. to derive estimates of minimum viable populations of lemurs in forest fragments of Madagascar; 2. to learn, at which size a forest fagment is perceived as ""forest"" by Malagasy reptiles; 3. to test whether the system of protected areas within the city of Hamburg represents a network for the local avifauna with species exchange or whether the single protected areas represent islands in the urban matrix; 4. to link life history traits to the vulnerability of species to the urban environment and to develop hypotheses on the causes underlying the evolution of nested patterns. The analysis of the urban system revealed that the Protected areas within the city limits of Hamburg are perceived by birds as islands in an urban matrix. ""Green"" links between the areas do not act as corridors that allow free movement of all species. The vulnerability of any given bird species to fragmentation of woodland habitat within the city depends on its ability to use the urban matrix between the protected areas and seems to be related to the investments in egg-shell material. Species with high requirements for egg-shells disappear earlier from the community. Analyses of nested patterns can provide insights in biodiversity processes and valuable recommendations for decision making where longterm data are not available.

However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes. We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition. For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids. The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens. Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Least-cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance-based modelling method to respond to urban planners' needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities. We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland-dwelling moths and forest-dwelling passerines, and to two medium-sized cities. We used mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch. Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP. Synthesis and applications.

Forty wetlands were studied in the Red River Valley (RRV), Southwest Prairie (SWP), and the Northern Hardwood Forest (NHF) ecoregions of Minnesota, USA, to assess the strength of association between local and landscape condition and avian community composition. We examined the relationship between bird assemblages and local and landscape factors (connectedness, isolation, road density, and site impacts). Landscape variables were calculated for three spatial scales at 500 m (79 ha), 1000 m (314 ha), and 2500 m (1963 ha). Connectedness and road density are important measures for predicting bird assemblages in both agricultural ecoregions (SWP and RRV). Connectedness and its relationship with wetland bird assemblages were most pronounced at the larger scale (2500 m), where the largest remnant patches can be discerned. In contrast, road effects on bird assemblages were most pronounced at the smallest scale (500 m). Wetland isolation corresponded to bird community patterns as well, but only in one ecoregion (SWP). In the urbanizing ecoregion (NHF), species richness was considerably lower than elsewhere but community patterns did not correspond to landscape variables. The focus of wetland conservation planning needs to shift from the site scale to the landscape scale to ensure that connection with the regional wetland pattern is accounted for, therefore, affording the best opportunity to successfully maintain wetland avian diversity.

Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean +/- SD = 7 +/- 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat.

In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites.

We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study-wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study-wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas.

Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds.

Observations by citizen scientists were used for a plausibility analysis and interpreting the results. Our results confirm the importance of gardens for providing habitat and connectivity. The overall landscape permeability to the movement of hedgehogs would decrease by 75% and the area of core habitats would decline by 63% without private and allotment gardens.

However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitatparameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders.

Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context. 2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant. 3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps. 4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of 'most forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955979311&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2664.2011.01978.x&partnerID=40&md5=bb53600d9b5389cf9890e0ab7799dd6c,48,2,permeability of a heterogeneous urban landscape to the movements of forest songbirds,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/511714; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01978.x/abstract; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND44579514

Studies have shown that urban and agricultural development cannot only harm species populations directly through habitat destruction, but also by destroying the corridors that connect habitat patches and populations within a metapopulation. Without these pathways, populations can encounter inbreeding depression and degeneration, which can increase death rates and lower rates of reproduction. This article describes the development and application of the FRAGGLE model, a spatial system dynamics model designed to calculate connectivity indices among populations. FRAGGLE can help planners and managers identify the relative contribution of populations associated with habitat patches to future populations in those patches, taking into account the importance of interstitial land to migration success. The model is applied to the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a threatened species whose southeastern U.S. distribution has diminished significantly within its native range due to agricultural and urban development over the last several decades. This model is parameterized with life history and movement traits of the gopher tortoise in order to simulate population demographics and spatial distribution within an area in west-central Georgia that supports a significant tortoise population. The implications of this simulation modeling effort are demonstrated using simple landscape representations and a hypothetical on land-use management scenario. Our findings show that development resulting in even limited habitat losses (10%) may lead to significant increases in fragmentation as measured by a loss in the rate of dispersions (31%) among area subpopulations.

Moreover, soil abiotic properties were analyzed to examine how local factors drive species assemblages in different landscape types. The results of the study highlighted that Collembola community structure is affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, Collembola communities with species-abundance structures typical of late successional stages were found within woody landscapes, whereas those with early successional stage structures were observed in wide turf patches surrounded by other vegetation covers. When turf patches become small and isolated, homogenization was observed in Collembola community composition.

Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vitria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard's similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may benefit generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species.

However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors.",10.1111/aec.12006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882685333&doi=10.1111%2faec.12006&partnerID=40&md5=af0646971a75b9d33b59033dce091628,38,3,"permeability of the urban matrix to arboreal gliding mammals: sugar gliders in melbourne, australia",10.1111/aec.12006,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aec.12006; http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/174519/; https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/863268-permeability-of-the-urban-matrix-to-arboreal-gliding-mammals--sugar-gliders-in-melbourne--australia

To assess the importance of the amount, spatial distribution, and configuration of greenspaces (comprised of terrestrial and aquatic areas), we examined semi-aquatic turtle species richness in urbanized areas. In this study, we sampled turtles from 2010 to 2011 at 20 ponds, including farm (rural) ponds, ponds in urbanized environments, and golf course ponds. We used a hierarchical Bayesian species-richness model to estimate species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to three pond types (rural, golf, or urban) and four landscape measurements of greenspace (i.e., Euclidean nearest neighbor, interspersion juxtaposition, percent of landscape, and connectance), generated in FRAGSTATS. We found that probability of occupancy of four species, Kinosternon subrubrum, Trachemys scripta, Chelydra serpentina, and Pseudemys concinna increased substantially with an increase in connectance of greenspace within 500 m of each pond. When the model examining the configuration of greenspaces was analyzed, estimated species richness was greater at golf ponds as compared to either rural or urban ponds, and richness increased with increasing connectivity of greenspaces. Our results indicate that in golf course ponds can potentially support a greater diversity of semi-aquatic turtle species than rural or urban ponds and thus may be considered superior habitat in suburban environments. In addition, we suggest that maintaining connectivity of greenspaces in suburban areas is important for semi-aquatic turtles and should be considered in urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

Location Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads.

Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement. 2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers. 3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0 center dot 001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0 center dot 952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0 center dot 001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels. 4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths < 50 m. 5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available. 6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72849121018&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2664.2009.01717.x&partnerID=40&md5=436a9cb3249d360a5dc5ea7ebc3c68c6,46,2,factors affecting the permeability of transportation and riparian corridors to the movements of songbirds in an urban landscape,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x/full; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103005048; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01717.x; https://europepmc.org/abstract/AGR/IND44291970

However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of ""natural"" habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle (""old-field""), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species.

While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March-October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system.

Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics.

Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement.

It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of 'bigger, better, and more joined up'. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity.

To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types.

Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species. Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements.

While urban green spaces are known to include many grassland habitats, it is uncertain to what extent urban land use types harbour grasslands of special conservation interest and whether patch characteristics and connectivity of these differ from grasslands on agricultural land. By relating the city-wide biotope mapping to the land use mapping of Berlin, Germany, we assessed (1) to which specific urban land use types the major grassland biotope types belong, (2) differences in patch characteristics and connectivity, and (3) the conservation value of grassland patches at a typological level by means of their legal protection status. Grasslands cover 5% of Berlin's surface, and 43% of that area is assigned to legally protected grassland types. The majority of legally protected grassland (71%) lies on urban land opposed to 29% on agricultural land. Airports and historic parks, which only cover 2% of land in Berlin, contain one-third of all protected dry grasslands. Wet grassland is more confined to agricultural land. In airports and agricultural areas, grassland patches are larger but of a more complex shape than those in historic parks. In airports, grassland patches show greater connectivity as they are situated in grassland-dominated surroundings. Grassland in historic parks appears to be more vulnerable due to smaller patch sizes and higher fragmentation. The example of Berlin demonstrates that the urban green infrastructure can clearly contribute to grassland conservation and may thus partially compensate for the decline of traditional grasslands in cultural landscapes. It will be important to involve residents and landowners in urban grassland conservation and management because most grassland of special conservation interest (57%) was found outside of conservation areas.

The species inhabits secondary forests and is particularly affected by fragmentation due to its habitat selectivity and low dispersal capability. We determined allele frequencies of six microsatellites to estimate genetic diversity of 33 local populations and pairwise genetic distances among them. Habitat suitability maps were developed based on two models, one with only climatic and topography as predictor variables (HSn), the second incorporating the potential barrier effect of urbanization as an additional variable (HSu). Ecological distances were calculated using the circuit theory applied to the habitat suitability maps. We found that within-population genetic diversity decreases as the HSu habitat suitability decreases. Moreover, pairwise population genetic distance showed the highest correlations with resistance (i.e., ecological) distances when the HSu map was used.

The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green-blue spaces to compact green-blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green-blue networks at city scale.

Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance. Results: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance. Conclusions: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size.

Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m).

Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified a series of habitat fragments along a gradient of urbanization in the fully urbanized areas and south suburbs of Denver, CO, both containing and not containing prairie dogs.

Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat.

To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5 m to 245.8 m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selling, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (N-ep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selling and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest N-ep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest.

We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of the type of urban structure (e.g. mono centric vs polycentric), the shape of urban boundaries, the local density of residential development, on the habitats of wildlife species. In this context, this paper focuses on the relationship between forms of urbanisation and functional connectivity of ecological habitats. In the urban region of Besancon (eastern France), three emblematic protected species were selected to represent forest mammals. From the initial state describing current land cover, five prospective residential development scenarios were simulated, corresponding to the form currently most commonly found (e.g. compact development, transit-oriented development, polycentric development). For each scenario, we also simulate the volume of traffic on the road network to allow for the barrier effect of roads on habitat connectivity. Then, for each development scenario, we model the functional connectivity of habitats of the various target species using landscape graphs. Results show that compact city maintains more functional connectivity for all the species considered whereas urban sprawl leads to much more marked impacts. Moderately compact and regulated periurban scenarios have intermediate levels of impact. The transit-oriented development scenario produces specific impact values according to the species. An interesting point is that the decline in functional connectivity of forest habitats is more due to increased traffic than residential development proper. This outlines the relevance of integrated models for simulating both land use and transport at a fine scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives.

Diversity, richness, and counts of many species increased with increasing fragment connectivity, and decreased on fragments isolated for longer periods of time. Avian diversity and richness did not differ between fragments with and without prairie dogs, suggesting that this element of the ecological role of prairie dogs is not fully retained in urban habitat.

We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history.

We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant.

We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy.

This study focuses on a particular vertical artificial habitat: masonry retaining walls in Hong Kong. We explored the diversity and co-existence of different plant growth forms, synoptic assessment of habitat conditions, and relationship between habitat factors and vegetation occurrence. Some 270 walls with notable plant colonization in old districts were studied. We surveyed intrinsic wall fabric, extrinsic site condition, tree species and abundance, and other types of plant cover. The data were evaluated with the help of principal component and multiple regression analyses. A wide assemblage of species and growth forms have established spontaneously on walls. The tree flora is dominated by Moraceae (Mulberry family) members, genus Ficus (figs or banyans), and particularly Ficus microcarpa. Trees with strangler characteristics pre-adapted to grow on the vertical habitat are strongly favoured, followed by ruderals and garden escapees. Natives outnumber exotics by a large margin. Multiple wall attributes could be condensed into four factors, classified as water-nutrient supply, habitat connectivity, structure-maintenance, and habitat size. The action of habitat factors on vegetation occurrence hinges on plant growth form and dimension. The occurrence of diminutive lichen-moss is related to the fundamental sustenance water-nutrient factor. The bigger mature trees are more dependent on the larger-scale habitat size factor. The medium-sized plants, including herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings, are contingent upon the dual influence of water-nutrient and habitat connectivity. Spatial contiguity with natural ecosystem can secure continual supplies of seeds, water, nutrient, genial microclimate, and clean air to foster wall vegetation growth. The conservation of walls and their companion flora could avoid degrading or reducing these critical enabling factors.

An analysis of isolation-by-resistance using a causal modeling approach showed an influence of landscape cover and/or trapping pressure on gene flow according to age and sex class. Overall, the connectivity in the study area is provided mainly by vegetation cover, while roads and open areas partially impede it. Unexpectedly for this ""urban adapter"" species, buildings could reduce gene flow. We also emphasized the sex-dependent effect of trapping on gene flow. Genetic differentiation in males was influenced by trapping pressure and landscape structure while only the latter influenced genetic differentiation in females. A stronger isolation by distance in males than in females suggested that at the scale of the study area, males are more exposed to trapping pressure, which reduces effective dispersal. Overall, the combination of both landscape and trapping costs might create an 'ecological trap' that could disrupt gene flow, leading to a north-south division in the study area.",10.1007/s10592-016-0862-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977111877&doi=10.1007%2fs10592-016-0862-1&partnerID=40&md5=95f74c86d91167b1f77f26e2aba4b4d8,17,5,age and sex-dependent effects of landscape cover and trapping on the spatial genetic structure of the stone marten (martes foina),10.1007/s10592-016-0862-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-016-0862-1; http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0862-1; https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0862-1; https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-doi-10_1007-S10592-016-0862-1; https://hal-univ-lyon1.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02053612

Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in periurban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusci-venter) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (< 1.4 m height) that is the species' preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers.

Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (<= 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a functiyon of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation.

Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec. Methods We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population. Results A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies.

We compared neutral-locus genetic diversity of individual song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) breeding in a naturally fragmented landscape (small coastal islands) to that of song sparrows in similar-sized 'urban islands' separated by roads and housing developments rather than by water. Individuals on coastal islands were more heterozygous and less inbred than those in urban islands. Estimates of population genetic structuring (assessed by pairwise genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods) and contemporary dispersal (based on assignment tests) revealed little structure within either landscape, suggesting that lack of connectivity at the geographic scale we investigated cannot explain the reduced heterozygosity of urban birds.

There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.",10.1111/csp2.92,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089833768&doi=10.1111%2fcsp2.92&partnerID=40&md5=1094b43106aa3a9a1d7d636edb04cbe4,1,6,ten years of pulling: ecosystem recovery after long-term weed management in garry oak savanna,10.1111/csp2.92,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/55083/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/csp2.92; https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.92

This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups. LocationSheffield area, UK. MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests. ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance. Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.",10.1111/ddi.12120,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885384297&doi=10.1111%2fddi.12120&partnerID=40&md5=dd29443045f993d333e9adabd1e0a520,19,6,species turnover and geographic distance in an urban river network,10.1111/ddi.12120,https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/species-turnover-and-geographic-distance-in-an-urban-river-networ; https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.12120; https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/78899/; https://core.ac.uk/display/20273781; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12120; https://core.ac.uk/download/20273781.pdf

While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment. We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development (urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways. Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal. Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition.

Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.",10.1007/s11252-022-01285-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139149979&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01285-w&partnerID=40&md5=9d2552292ed22a7477605627e8a9c5c3,NA,4,differential response of migratory guilds of birds to park area and urbanization,10.1007/s11252-022-01285-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139149979&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01285-w&partnerID=40&md5=9d2552292ed22a7477605627e8a9c5c3

The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.",10.1111/njb.02175,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/njb.02175,37,1,"disturbance, microclimate and historical habitat connectivity determine the population performance of the threatened grassland specialist carex caryophyllea in remnant grasslands",10.1111/njb.02175,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/njb.02175

An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships forP. regillain a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explainedP. regillaoccupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands.

We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2.5-4 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.",10.3389/fevo.2019.00474,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077269135&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2019.00474&partnerID=40&md5=f43bed1894ede6637b5984e80ab80edb,7,2,configuration and location of small urban gardens affect colonization by monarch butterflies,10.3389/fevo.2019.00474,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00474/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00474/full; https://uknowledge.uky.edu/entomology_facpub/192/; https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=entomology_facpub

Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour. Methods We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada. Results Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario. Conclusions Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.",10.1186/s40462-022-00318-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128049664&doi=10.1186%2fs40462-022-00318-5&partnerID=40&md5=9d3b805b8973a4a888404aaf658d0f03,10,5,"towns and trails drive carnivore movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity",10.1186/s40462-022-00318-5,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2651963820?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=KVshdI%2F95JfwvNxFJ2HF7VPMYLY%3D

Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with variation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects of bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.",10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031422643&doi=10.1046%2fj.1523-1739.1997.96100.x&partnerID=40&md5=fd5e045b0232215e0ef669ac053c180c,11,2,"the use of bushland, corridors, and linear remnants by birds in southeastern queensland, australia",10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2387400; https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x/abstract?globalMessage=0; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x/abstract; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96100.x/abstract?globalMessage=0
