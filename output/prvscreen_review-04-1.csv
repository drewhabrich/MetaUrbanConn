Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium- and local-scale to assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered “non-habitat”, i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.024","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417304408; https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/163783; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417304408; https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/publicacao/141440/prospecting-the-potential-of-ecosystem-restoration-a-propos/","Ecological Engineering","5","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.024","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417304408; https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/163783; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857417304408; https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/publicacao/141440/prospecting-the-potential-of-ecosystem-restoration-a-propos/"

Solar energy is absorbed and stored in pavements leading to an increase in surface temperatures. Decreasing green cover is further contributing to rise in regional temperatures. Due to this activity, the city experiences urban heat island (UHI). This study presents a critical review of the literature on mitigation measures to combat UHI using reflective pavements with an emphasis on durability properties and impacts of tree canopy. The strategies with a focus on application of chip seals, white toppings, and coatings were discussed. Role of surface reflectance, including those from asphalt and concrete pavements, albedo improvements, and technological trends, application of waste materials, and industrial by-products are presented. Also, urban tree shading systems’ contribution to pavement temperature and microclimate systems is presented. The review shows that the development of mitigation measures using tree shading systems can reduce the pavement temperature during daytime and increase human thermal comfort. The outcomes of this review provide a scope for future studies to develop sustainable and state-of-the-art engineering solutions in the field of reflective coatings and urban forest systems.","10.3390/buildings11030093","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102706377&doi=10.3390%2fbuildings11030093&partnerID=40&md5=b4537d8c9fe0b51698a88e24ce74bb8f","Buildings","4","10.3390/buildings11030093","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102706377&doi=10.3390%2fbuildings11030093&partnerID=40&md5=b4537d8c9fe0b51698a88e24ce74bb8f"

The urban comfort, microclimate, and site qualities are responsive to the urban design. Improving ventilation within the public open space has been carried out according to the direction of the prevailing wind during the various seasons (wind corridors); protection from winter wind (through rows of trees) and promotion of summer wind penetration have also been achieved, with a consequent reduction in building energy demand. At the building level, microclimates have been created that are responsive to urban texture and building typologies. Optimization of the architectural form and functions of exterior and interior open and closed building spaces has occurred through Fluent simulations (fluid dynamic software simulations). The building typology interventions utilize a cooling system for ventilation through a stack effect, integrated with the convective loop system and combined with the use of a chimney to achieve a cooling and ventilation system that is able to produce, in summertime, a good microclimate and adequate indoor conditions. The installation of obstruction/reflection elements outside the passive systems of the windows permits sun radiation to be screened during the hot period and reflects the direct solar radiation on the ceiling in winter time, thus using the ceiling as a thermal storage element and reflecting the remaining solar radiation in order to obtain uniform natural lighting system without glare. © Richard Hyde, 2008.

The results reveal that airborne ethylene concentrations at the ppb levels are commonplace and can arise in the vicinity of traffic corridors, forest fires, indoor kitchens, horticultural areas, oil fields, house fires, and petrochemical sites. The primary biogenic sources of ethylene derive from microbial activity in most soil and marine environments as well as its biological formation in wide variety of plant species. Sizable amounts of ethylene can also result from the burning of fossil fuels, forest and savanna fires, and crop residue combustion. Motor vehicle exhaust is the largest contributor to urban ethylene levels under most circumstances, but industrial flare releases and fugitive emissions may also be of relevance. Occupational exposures generally range up to about 50-100 ppm and have been documented for those working in the horticultural, petrochemical, and fire and rescue industries. Continuous personal monitoring at the community level has documented exposures of 3-4 ppb. These levels are more closely associated with the ethylene concentrations found indoors rather than outdoors indicating the importance of exposure sources found within the home. Indoor air sources of ethylene are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, wood or propane fuel use, fruit and vegetable storage, and cooking. Ethylene is not found in any consumer or commercial products and does not off-gas from building products to any appreciable extent. The review indicates that outdoor sources located some distance from the home do not make an appreciable contribution to personal exposures given the strength and variety of sources found in the immediate living environment.

A future direction for legislators and policy makers is presented as a means to improve the condition of urban waterways. Ensuring water management professionals appropriately value river systems is a key element. Waterways occupy a tenuous position in the urban landscape despite their ecological significance, often providing the last refuges for biodiversity. Smaller waterways are often piped to improve stormwater drainage, while larger systems are chemically, physically and biologically degraded as a result of development within the catchment. Legal, planning and policy arrangements have historically provided limited protection for urban waterways and riparian environments. This is due to four main factors: rivers are traditionally valued for their utility as conduits for stormwater to manage flooding; the biodiversity value of riparian areas is not widely understood and acknowledged; the cumulative impacts of development on river health are not recognised; and an inadequate legal definition for river in legislation and at common law. The fate of many urban riparian environments is often determined due to death by a thousand pipes.",NA,NA,"Jour","4",NA,NA

Typically created through Geographical Information Systems and modelling processes at regional and even continental scales, these projects are seldom evaluated or 'ground-truthed' for their potential application at the local level where land use is fully allocated and replete with human occupation. This article reviews the accuracy of one such continental-scale connectivity conservation network, the National Green Network, through assessment and redesign by a design charrette at the local scale in York, Western Australia. Breaking with traditional process, this research considered the National Green Network model not as a final plan, but as point of departure for an iterative adjustment and redesign process through the charrette and an additional detailed design stage. Commonplace in architecture and urban planning disciplines, the application of charrettes to connectivity conservation design offers the benefits of improving design accuracy and enhancing their potential for implementation through providing valuable feedback and iterative design adjustment. The fine-tuning conducted by this research enabled the design to factor in human land-uses and influences across complex landscapes, while considering in a critical manner cultural factors that could also influence the system's design and its success. The framing of the network as green infrastructure rather than as connectivity conservation in addition to further illustration by the landscape architect provided a spectrum of both ecological and cultural outcomes across the case study landscape, demonstrating potential impacts and opportunities offered through a series of spatially accurate and ground-truthed plans.","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.001","https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/beyond-ecological-modelling-ground-truthing-connectivity-conserva; https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/99728/1/pagination_LAND_3122.pdf; https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/99728; http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30135346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920461730097X; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920461730097X; http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30135346","Landscape and Urban Planning","3","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.001","https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/beyond-ecological-modelling-ground-truthing-connectivity-conserva; https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/99728/1/pagination_LAND_3122.pdf; https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/99728; http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30135346; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920461730097X; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920461730097X; http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30135346"

Several urban insects have become notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to wider appreciation of environmental benefits of 'open spaces', urban forests, connectivity, 'green architecture' and other landscape features as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna. Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation, the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability contributing to the wider values of urban environments.","10.1111/aen.12332","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044478714&doi=10.1111%2faen.12332&partnerID=40&md5=bd702cfc211ac2433a7cda440fff11a5","Austral Entomology","1","10.1111/aen.12332","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aen.12332; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aen.12332; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aen.12332"

The traditional concept of protecting isolated remnants of endangered habitats as nature reserves could not stop the continuing decline of endangered species and the regional losses in biodiversity sufficiently. During the last century, different approaches to protect open space, species, and habitats have been developed. Based on a literature review, an analysis of the legal framework and a representative case study, this paper tries to characterise the development of greenways and habitat networks in Germany and to discuss the general possibilities and limitations in an European context. In Germany, greenways were first established to prevent urban sprawl, to separate settlements, to provide recreational opportunities and to improve air quality in industrialised urban areas. The increased relevance of nature conservation has led to the development of new types of habitat networks in addition to the greenway concept since 1980. Species-oriented habitat networks focus on the specific requirements of target species, while multifunctional habitat networks try to address many landscape functions when reconnecting the remnant habitats. The Kronsberg Project is an example of a local, multifunctional habitat network. It illustrates some of the implementation difficulties resulting from conflicting interests of the various user groups. In addition, the need became obvious to plan multifunctional networks which allow for spatial separation of conflicting site related objectives. The legal framework for habitat networks in Germany is, in principle, a sound legislation which requires that habitat networks cover a minimum of 10% of the total land area of the German states. The conceptualisation of the networks must not be restricted to the boundaries of the individual German states because the networks should have an interstate character and also contribute to the European network of Natura 2000. However, this national and European network cannot be presently implemented by the German national authorities. Instead, the framework legislation must be passed as nature conservation laws at the state level, while concrete implementation takes place at the regional and local levels. There the implementation is hampered primarily by property ownership considerations or conflicting interests of landowners. This situation hinders the implementation of national and European objectives for habitat networks. In order to create a forward looking network strategy for Germany, more authority should be transferred to the national level. In addition, a stronger link between the scientific and conceptual basis of habitat networks is needed. Prioritising landscape functions and the selection of target species require better coordination. Economic incentives could be used to reduce the conflicts with landowners. Hopefully, a change in the EU-agricultural policy will facilitate this development. (c) 2004, Elsevier B.V.

Each category is divided into EES types: (a) amelioration of air quality; restoration of soil and water; amelioration of the microclimate; removal of CO2 from the air; (b) provision of habitat for biodiversity; support for resilient urban ecosystems; provision of genetic diversity; and (c) provision of energy and nutrients; provision of grey infrastructure resilience. Each EES type provides one or more benefits. For each of these 12 benefits, we propose a set of indicators to be used when analyzing the impacts on the identified EESs. Around half of the 36 indicators are relevant to more than one single benefit, which highlights complex interrelationships. The indicators of wider applicability are tree and stand characteristics, followed by leaf physical traits and tree species composition.

The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued.","10.7717/peerj.12788","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126569300&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.12788&partnerID=40&md5=12924137e5db39af5ecb9f36b81a868f","Peerj","3","10.7717/peerj.12788","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2638167077?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=YXtfw0w6kda4ebt0HzFOZRBbJZE%3D"

Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change.

The ecological resilience of urban ecosystems--the degree to which they tolerate alteration before reorganizing around a new set of structures and processes--is influenced by these interactions. In cities and urbanizing areas fragmentation of natural habitats, simplification and homogenization of species composition, disruption of hydrological systems, and alteration of energy flow and nutrient cycling reduce cross-scale resilience, leaving systems increasingly vulnerable to shifts in system control and structure. Because varied urban development patterns affect the amount and interspersion of built and natural land cover, as well as the human demands on ecosystems differently, we argue that alternative urban patterns (i.e., urban form, land use distribution, and connectivity) generate varied effects on ecosystem dynamics and their ecological resilience. We build on urban economics, landscape ecology, population dynamics, and complex system science to propose a conceptual model and a set of hypotheses that explicitly link urban pattern to human and ecosystem functions in urban ecosystems. Drawing on preliminary results from an empirical study of the relationships between urban pattern and bird and aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in the Puget Sound region, we propose that resilience in urban ecosystems is a function of the patterns of human activities and natural habitats that control and are controlled by both socio-economic and biophysical processes operating at various scales. We discuss the implications of this conceptual model for urban planning and design.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","10/bb6zd3","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/758398490?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=V99itsZATEr0d7aKO74sDJ2XVHg%3D","Urban Ecosystems","2","10/bb6zd3","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/758398490?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=V99itsZATEr0d7aKO74sDJ2XVHg%3D"

Inaccuracies in these products could have consequences for future decision making, especially in data-poor regions like the tropics. In this study, potential biases in global and regional tree cover products were assessed across a diverse tropical country, Costa Rica. Two global tree cover products and one regional national forest cover map were evaluated along biophysical gradients in elevation, precipitation, and agricultural land cover. To quantify product accuracy and bias, freely available high-resolution imagery was used to validate tree and land cover across these gradients. Although the regional forest cover map was comparable in accuracy to a widely-used global forest map (the Global Forest Change of Hansen et al., also known as the GFC), another global forest map (derived from a cropland dataset) had the highest accuracy. Both global and regional forest cover products showed small to severe biases along biophysical gradients. Unlike the regional map, the global GFC map strongly underestimated tree cover (>10% difference) below 189 mm of precipitation and at elevations above 2000 m, with a larger bias for precipitation. All map products misclassified agricultural fields as forest, but the GFC product particularly misclassified row crops and perennial erect crops (banana, oil palm, and coffee), with maximum tree cover in agricultural fields of 89%–100% across all crops. Our analysis calls into further question the utility of the GFC product for global forest monitoring outside humid regions, indicating that, in tropical regions, the GFC product is most accurate in areas with high, aseasonal rainfall, low relief, and low cropland area. Given that forest product errors are spatially distributed along biophysical gradients, researchers should account for these spatial biases when attempting to analyze or generate forest map products.","10/gh3cwh","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2548517460?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=8E5wHklF8FK20K1Q9LiTo4YCojM%3D","Forests","2","10/gh3cwh","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2548517460?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=8E5wHklF8FK20K1Q9LiTo4YCojM%3D"

Beginning with a brief history of environmental movements, the guide then focuses on changing approaches to conserving the natural environment. It explains environmental sustainability approaches as well as techniques for planners, using ideas such as environmental capacity and natural capital and, more recently, ecosystem services and multi-functional solutions. It addresses issues of spatial scale, connectivity, and ecological networks, recognizing that small nature reserves are vulnerable and lack the resilience to substantially change.

The prevention of new, establishing species is less costly, both economically and ecologically, and is more manageable than eradicating nonnative invasive species once they are widespread and negatively impactful. We ask if international trade hubs and points-of-entry with high-volume trade, constant disturbance, and propagule rain have a higher number of nonnative species compared to surrounding areas and if they may serve as initial establishment sites and refugia of nonnative, invasive populations. Therefore, we partnered with various federal, state, and private interests to evaluate the floristic composition at the Garden City Terminal of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, USA. We conducted the following study to demonstrate the collaborative relationship-building between researchers and industry and to develop a framework for biodiversity conservation. In our study, we collected all reproductive vascular plants in the secured areas of the Garden City Terminal during four major seasonal time points over two years. The percent of nonnative species and number of nonnative plant species per hectare at this industrial location exceeded all other comparison floras. The mean coefficient of conservatism was lowest among the comparison floras, indicating a highly disturbed habitat with nonnative, weedy native, and other native species tolerant of disturbance. Our study represents one of the first inventories of an Industrialized Flora and indicates that such areas are hot-spots of nonnative plant diversity and possible sources of emergent plant invasions. We posit that industrial sites and international points-of-entry should be considered laboratories for research on species transport and introduction, adaptability, and taxonomic delineation to better understand the mechanisms and consequences of biotic homogenization due to the volume and frequency of anthropogenic activities.","10/gn6kxk","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2385222351?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gUvfyw9B%2B0UVojJBYcnxh8rzt%2BY%3D","Plos One","8","10/gn6kxk","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2385222351?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gUvfyw9B%2B0UVojJBYcnxh8rzt%2BY%3D"

National-level efforts aimed at tiger conservation, such as the creation of protected areas, have been critical for the survival of key tiger populations. However, for tigers to continue to survive into the future, it is important that these key populations remain connected with each other, particularly in this transboundary landscape. This requires greater regional and cross-border co-operation in conservation research, monitoring, and planning to protect habitats and corridors. Here, we review and synthesize the available literature on two decades of conservation efforts aimed at the study and conservation of tigers, their co-predators, and prey in the landscape to understand research trends, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest priority areas for future research and conservation interventions. This review could be useful for formulating conservation plans and actions that could help in the recovery of tiger populations; for identifying, restoring, and securing connectivity between key tiger habitats; and for addressing other key threats, such as habitat loss, poaching, and trade in wildlife parts.AbstractAddressing the effects of human-caused habitat destruction on free-ranging threatened large carnivores requires actions that go ‘beyond borders’ in conserving and protecting their habitat and prey base. In this review, we compiled information from available literature on 20 years of conservation efforts aimed at tigers, co-predators, and their prey in the Far-Eastern Himalayan Landscape that is situated at the confluence of three global biodiversity hotspots covering parts of India, Myanmar, and China. The vast area of the proven biodiversity-rich forested landscape is highly suitable for long-term survival of carnivores, such as tigers. Habitat loss, ritual hunting, commercial exploitation, and poaching are the prevailing threats that have resulted in low tiger, co-predator, and prey population densities. Studies suggest that tiger presence is confined to a few areas, while other tiger populations have been extirpated across most parts of the landscape. Past research also suggests that the landscape holds low abundance of diverse prey species richness (n = 22), and urgent conservation measures are required to improve their habitat and numbers. This calls for greater regional and transboundary co-operation on research and knowledge sharing, conservation awareness programs for locals, and cross-border co-operation on wildlife monitoring. Strict policies are also required to enable PA managers to develop strategic plans to conserve large predators and protect their habitats and corridors.",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2564511887?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VkZuGlKc7eLTaydc39buDPVGHv0%3D","Animals","6",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2564511887?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VkZuGlKc7eLTaydc39buDPVGHv0%3D"

The successful movement of individuals is fundamental to life. Facilitating these movements by promoting ecological connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation. Urban areas contain more than half of the world's human population, and their potential to support biodiversity and to connect their citizens to nature is increasingly recognized. Promoting ecological connectivity within these areas is essential to reaching this potential. However, our current understanding of ecological connectivity within urban areas appears limited. 2. We reviewed the published scientific literature to assess the state-of-the-art of ecological connectivity research in urban areas, summarized trends in study attributes and highlighted knowledge gaps. 3. We found 174 papers that investigated ecological connectivity within urban areas. These papers addressed either structural (48) or functional connectivity (111), and some addressed both (15), but contained substantial geographic and taxonomic biases. These papers rarely defined the aspect of connectivity they were investigating and objective descriptions of the local urban context were uncommon. Formulated hypotheses or a priori predictions were typically unstated and many papers used suboptimal study designs and methods. 4. We suggest future studies explicitly consider and quantify the landscape within their analyses and make greater use of available and rapidly developing tools and methods for measuring functional connectivity (e.g. biotelemetry or landscape genetics). We also highlight the need for studies to clearly define how the terms 'urban' and 'connectivity' have been applied. 5. Knowledge gaps in ecological connectivity in urban areas remain, partly because the field is still in its infancy and partly because we must better capitalize on the state-of-the-art technological and analytical techniques that are increasingly available. Well-designed studies that employed high-resolution data and powerful analytical techniques highlight our abilities to quantify ecological connectivity in urban areas. These studies are exemplary, setting the standards for future research to facilitate data-driven and evidence-based biodiversity-friendly infrastructure planning in urban areas.","10.1111/1365-2435.12489","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND603408872; https://core.ac.uk/display/46087138; https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2189416; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12489/full; https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/ecological-connectivity-research-in-urban-areas(93b5c430-e263-4efb-a048-b38049bca24d).html; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/40030; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/986461-ecological-connectivity-research-in-urban-areas","Functional Ecology","5","10.1111/1365-2435.12489","https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND603408872; https://core.ac.uk/display/46087138; https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2189416; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12489/full; https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/ecological-connectivity-research-in-urban-areas(93b5c430-e263-4efb-a048-b38049bca24d).html; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/40030; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12489; https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/986461-ecological-connectivity-research-in-urban-areas"

These tools are valuable to the field of biogeography, where they are commonly used to infer potential connectivity among populations. However, a recent study showed that when locally relevant environmental data are not available, records from patches of suitable habitat protruding into otherwise unsuitable regions (e.g., gallery forests within dry areas) can lead to overestimations of species niches and their potential distributions. Here, we test whether this issue obfuscates detection of an obvious environmental barrier existing in northern Venezuela – that of the hot and xeric lowlands separating the Península de Paraguaná from mainland South America. These conditions most likely promote isolation between mainland and peninsular populations of three rodent lineages occurring in mesic habitat in this region. For each lineage, we calibrated optimally parameterized ENMs using mainland records only, and leveraged existing habitat descriptions to assess whether those assigned low suitability values corresponded to instances where the species was collected within locally mesic conditions amidst otherwise hot dry areas. When this was the case, we built an additional model excluding these records. We projected both models onto the peninsula and assessed whether they differed in their ability to detect the environmental barrier. For the two lineages in which we detected such problematic records, only the models built excluding them detected the barrier, while providing additional insights regarding peninsular populations.

Issues relate to wildlife conservation in urban areas has been studied for many years and thus, the research makes a review for how the green corridors contribute to the conservation of urban wildlife. This study reviews groups of articles in disciplines of urban landscape planning and biology conservation to discuss the relationship between elements of green corridors and urban wildlife dispersal movement behaviour in Malaysian context. Accordingly, this research is purposely studied to give understanding on how green corridors contribute to the animals' ability of moving and dispersing within the built-up areas. In advance, it is found that there are three factors contribute to the capability of colonization among urban wildlife which are individual, physical and social factor. Green corridor has been defined as one of the physical factor that influence urban wildlife behaviour movement. Consequently, safety area indicating to animals species for traversing in any time such as at night can be defined as the primary potential corridor.","10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012093","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902334831&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f18%2f1%2f012093&partnerID=40&md5=bd01c6f404fff3aaa7fa672c56cfda4b","8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (Isde8)","2","10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012093","http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014E&ES...18a2093A/abstract; https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012093/pdf; https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012093"

One promising solution approach is the application of decentralized eco-technologies for water management such as green roofs and constructed wetlands, which also have the potential to improve urban biodiversity. We review the effects of these two eco-technologies on species richness, abundance and other facets of biodiversity (e.g., functional diversity). We find that while green roofs support fewer species than ground-level habitats and thus are not a substitute for the latter, the increase in green roof structural diversity supports species richness. Species abundance benefits from improved roof conditions (e.g., increased substrate depth). Few studies have investigated the functional diversity of green roofs so far, but the typical traits of green roof species have been identified. The biodiversity of animals in constructed wetlands can be improved by applying animal-aided design rather than by solely considering engineering requirements. For example, flat and barrier-free shore areas, diverse vegetation, and heterogeneous surroundings increase the attractiveness of constructed wetlands for a range of animals. We suggest that by combining and making increasing use of these two eco-technologies in urban areas, biodiversity will benefit.","10.3390/su11205846","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/20/5846/pdf; https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/10680; https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/10680/1/sustainability-11-05846-v2.pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/20/5846","Sustainability","3","10.3390/su11205846","https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/20/5846/pdf; https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/10680; https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/10680/1/sustainability-11-05846-v2.pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/20/5846"

Essentially parks and heritage areas include all areas protected by legal or customary means ""to fulfil private, local, national and international responsibilities in marine and terrestrial protection; and to recognize, protect and present, both directly and indirectly, places which are significant examples of the world's heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, appreciation, enjoyment and use of this heritage in a sustainable manner"". (TFC/CNPPA 1990).The evolution of this heritage estate, now combined with new ideas in conservation biology, landscape ecology and ecosystem management, is forcing recognition of the need to take a more comprehensive systemic view of the design and protection of parks and heritage areas. The ideas of representation and integrity, as promoted by the Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (Gauthier et al 1995; Gauthier 1992), World Wildlife Fund Canada (Noss 1995; Kavanagh and lacobelli no date), and others (Riley and [Pat Mohr] 1994; Noss 1992), offer cornerstones for protected area systems, that prompt a multi - jurisdictional view of parks and heritage areas based on a common framework to which all areas and all jurisdictions contribute. This multi jurisdictional view sees a network of parks and heritage areas carefully designed at a landscape scale to insure that all elements are adequately represented, and all ecological processes are maintained to sustain the system. Without losing sight of the core areas, today's perspective places equal attention on critical linkages, corridors and ecological processes. Figure 2 depicts one such systemic view, illustrating protected nodes linked by natural corridors, not unlike the connectivity of organs by pulmonary or circulatory system in an organism. Developed to this level, parks and heritage systems assume a central importance in defining and protecting what is colloquially recognized as ""countryside"" by local communities and citizens.Today, in Ontario, different jurisdictions involved in parks and heritage areas are finding convergent paths that contribute to countryside conservation. On one front, the notion of greater park ecosystem, being advanced by Parks Canada and other conservation bodies, seeks to extend the influence of national parks and other protected areas through the mitigation of trans - boundary stressors and the maintenance of surrounding ecological features and processes essential to sustain an area's ecological integrity ([Bill Stephenson] 1996). From a provincial perspective, Ontario Parks and the Ministry of Natural Resources continue to utilize a complementary systems framework that seeks to represent the ecological diversity of 13 site regions and 65 site districts (Figure 3) within a system of parks and protected areas (McCleary et al 1992). And at a regional level, conservation authorities and municipalities apply planning and regulatory controls that help to protect heritage areas and maintain broader landscape integrity. Many of these regional authorities have instituted environmental advisory committees which solicit community - based input in the course of advising elected officials on environmental matters including heritage conservation. On the landscape, these efforts yield a mosaic of dedicated core areas, nested in larger heritage systems that are feathered into working landscapes (Figure 4).",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/207673525?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ELrpjlRizs2zhi88E456iElU7I0%3D","Environments","2",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/207673525?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ELrpjlRizs2zhi88E456iElU7I0%3D"

Early urban representations evolved from the constraints of deep ecological structure in the landscape to built elements that must work around natural linear obstacles-rivers, coastlines, dunes, cliffs, hills and valley swamps. Village commons were linked by roads. The Industrial Revolution led to accelerating urban growth, where the role of open space focussed on public health and transport. The Renaissance, Baroque and Picturesque movements accentuated networks in wooded parks, boulevards and sweeping riverine vistas. These provided a new aesthetic and sense of grandeur in the urban centres of European empires and later their colonies. Grafted onto this visual connectivity has been an awakened ecological understanding of spatial dynamics. The emergent notion of ecological corridor functionality provided support for green linear features, although initially this was based on untested theory. The idea of organisms moving along green highways seemed logical, but only recently has unequivocal empirical evidence emerged that demonstrates this functionality. Nevertheless, the main role of corridors may be to provide habitat rather than to act as connectors of nodal habitats. Most organisms can utilise stepping stones, and these may accommodate desired meta-populations while deterring pest movement. Swale drains and treatment wetlands provide riparian services and serve as biodiversity corridors. However, to most people the obvious function is visual-providing green fingers through what would otherwise be urban grey. The health benefits of these are have been demonstrated to be psychological as much as biophysical.","10.1007/s11355-010-0143-y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79551506189&doi=10.1007%2fs11355-010-0143-y&partnerID=40&md5=da573234840c11c62228444cdb3b2434","Landscape and Ecological Engineering","3","10.1007/s11355-010-0143-y","https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/planning-and-design-of-ecological-networks-in-urban-areas; https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glenn_Stewart5/publication/225615951_Planning_and_design_of_ecological_networks_in_urban_areas/links/02e7e52817172c65be000000.pdf; https://www.fh-erfurt.de/urbio/httpdocs/content/documents/URBIO2010/urbio2010_keynote_ignatieva.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11355-010-0143-y"

Fahrig concluded that to date there is no empirical evidence supporting the widespread assumption that a group of small habitat patches generally has lower ecological value than large patches of the same total area. Fletcher et al. (2018) dispute this conclusion, arguing that the literature to date indicates generally negative ecological effects of habitat fragmentation per se. They base their argument largely on extrapolation from patch-scale patterns and mechanisms (effects of patch size and isolation, and edge effects) to landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation. We argue that such extrapolation is unreliable because: (1) it ignores other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales (e.g., increased habitat diversity, spreading of risk, landscape complementation) that can counteract effects of the documented patch-scale mechanisms; and (2) extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern is not evidence of that pattern but, rather a prediction that must be tested at the larger scale. Such tests were the subject of Fahrig's review. We find no support for Fletcher et al.'s claim that biases in Fahrig's review would alter its conclusions. We encourage further landscape-scale empirical studies of effects of habitat fragmentation per se, and research aimed at uncovering the mechanisms that underlie positive fragmentation effects.","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.026","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320718313375","Biological Conservation","22","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.026","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320718313375"

Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas. 3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.","10.1111/1365-2664.12087","https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087/full; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/managing-urban-ecosystems-for-goods-and-services; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.12087%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2664.CONSERVEVIDENCE; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.12087","Journal of Applied Ecology","3","10.1111/1365-2664.12087","https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087/full; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12087; https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/managing-urban-ecosystems-for-goods-and-services; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.12087%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2664.CONSERVEVIDENCE; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.12087"

The benefits of using active remote sensing technologies are illustrated by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate a high resolution, 3-dimensional surface model. Among the major transport corridors in the Sydney metropolitan area, segments of two long-established main roads were selected for detailed studies of the roadside forest resource. Data analysis indicated that roadside trees are very diverse and distributed in a patchy way. Some areas are treeless and some have dense stands.

Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify their health at multiple scales.

Ecologists historically rejected urban ecosystems as important environments for ecology and evolution research but are beginning to recognize the importance of these systems in shaping the biology of invasion. Urbanization can aid the introduction, establishment, and spread of invaders, and these processes have substantial consequences on native species and ecosystems. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how urban areas influence populations at all stages in the invasion process. Population genetic tools are essential to explore the driving forces of invasive species dispersal, connectivity, and adaptation within cities. In this review, we synthesize current research about the influence of urban landscapes on invasion genetics dynamics. We conclude that urban areas are not only points of entry for many invasive species, they also facilitate population establishment, are pools for genetic diversity, and provide corridors for further spread both within and out of cities.

Aquatic-terrestrial networks demonstrate links across biological levels of organization, integrate both direct and indirect interactions, and can be used to predict ecosystem responses to perturbations. We provide 2 examples of river-riparian ecological networks across urban-rural land-use gradients to show how network approaches can be used for conservation, management, and monitoring. For instance, when we simulated the removal of sensitive emerging insect taxa, we observed the greatest change in compartmentalization, or in this case, the degree to which the network contained discrete aquatic and terrestrial sub-webs, in forested and agricultural stream reaches compared with urban reaches. Similarly, we illustrate how shifts in diets of insectivorous fishes (i.e., node behavior) from both terrestrial and aquatic prey to either terrestrial or aquatic insect prey can result in reduced frequency of trophic interactions (complexity) and fewer interacting taxa (compartmentalization). Both examples point to potential signs of destabilizing ecosystems or regimes shifts (i.e., persistent changes in the structure of function of river-riparian ecosystems). Thus, these network approaches can help identify environmental problems and inform their management solutions. However, constructing aquatic-terrestrial networks and simulations requires high-resolution monitoring data from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.","10.1086/706071","https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/706071","Freshwater Science","2","10.1086/706071","https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/706071"

The main aim of this study is to respond to the call for integrative research by studying relationships between the anthropogenic activities and urban biodiversity of the cities from the southern part of Rajasthan, India. We observed that the local population was interested in biodiversity, especially phenological events, and benefited from it by getting aesthetic pleasure and information on seasonal changes. The cities, such as Udaipur have an artificially developed diversified habitat within urban limits which provides shelter and protection to a variety of flora and fauna species. Urban areas are often rich in species, particularly vascular plants and many groups of animals, especially birds. Further, urban green spaces in the form of artificial parks and agricultural fields have the diversity of flora, whereas artificial lakes are the sites of wetland species. The most eye-catching faunal group of birds was used to understand the importance of biodiversity for Udaipur. Bird diversity and abundance are indicators of the condition of watershed habitats, both terrestrial and wetland. The role of urban areas in functions, such as the provision of ecosystem services will largely be determined by patterns of biodiversity within that area. To keep these biological indicators healthy, watershed conditions should be managed to encourage bird survival and reproduction. Further, to support an integrative approach in urban green planning, both ecological and social research has to be incorporated in the planning process.","10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31","https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31; https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-017-8878-6_31.pdf","Security of Water, Food, Energy and Liveability of Cities: Challenges and Opportunities for Peri-Urban Futures","3","10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31","https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31; https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-8878-6_31; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-017-8878-6_31.pdf"

However, this fauna is being increasingly threatened, in particular the one that inhabits deserts, one of the last biomes on earth. This work tracks the most relevant global change drivers acting on drylands, especially in deserts and arid regions, the conservation actions being developed, and the research needs for vertebrate conservation, following IUCN standardised classification schemes. Using the Sahara-Sahel wetlands as case study, it is provided a detailed examination of these aspects to support regional biodiversity conservation and human welfare. Deserts and arid regions are threatened by the synergistic effects of increasing development of urban areas, agriculture, energy production, mining, transportation and service corridors, resulting in pollution, invasive species, human intrusions and disturbance, biological resource overuse and in general, natural system modifications. In addition, climate change together with social underdevelopment of many desert-range countries places the mitigation of threat factors in a large and complex web of global-local societal challenges. Conservation actions targeting land/water and species protection and management, as well as education, awareness, capacity building, and legislation measures to increase livelihood development, are being developed. Additional research efforts are need to enhance biodiversity conservation planning, monitoring biodiversity and land-degradation status (based on Essential Biodiversity Variables), and quantification of socioeconomic factors associated with sustainable use of natural resources and human development. Sahara-Sahel wetlands are important life-support systems for both humans and vertebrates, the last vulnerable to listed global threats. They offer framework scenario to revert current environmental and societal challenges in deserts. Long-term conservation of desert vertebrate biodiversity requires appropriate policy instruments to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Raising environmental alertness within local communities of uniqueness of desert biodiversity is needed to promote policy change.","10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496","European Zoological Journal","5","10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24750263.2021.1991496"

Successful urban wildlife corridor conservation thus requires a collaborative approach and a cohesive plan that transcends municipal boundaries. Here we demonstrate how urban wildlife corridor conservation can provide a unique opportunity to build bridges not only for wildlife but also among scientists, non-profits, government agencies, and communities.

An adaptation strategy was developed to accommodate the challenges of urban greenspace design under a changing climate. The strategy offers a protocol for planting design that focuses on adding resilience to plantings rather than matching specific plant species to specific predictions of climate change. The adaptation strategy begins by rating locally appropriate plant species on ecological criteria for plasticity, functional redundancy, response diversity, and structural diversity. The plant palette is then developed within the confines set by ecological value and aesthetic goals, plus cultural and financial considerations. Collective application of the strategy at smaller scales across the urban landscape has the potential to protect and expand nature corridors that are resilient to climate change and to provide a low cost version of assisted migration. Examples of how to apply the adaptation strategy demonstrate that the approach is not specific to place or scale, and does not require extensive training or bring added expense. The benefits and manageable challenges of the strategy are discussed in relation to biodiversity conservation, social impact, the opportunity for ""designed"" experiments that examine urban ecosystem processes, and existing model forecasts for climate change.","10.3368/lj.30.2.173","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79954569884&doi=10.3368%2flj.30.2.173&partnerID=40&md5=c624aa0d0d01188ca1929c4ac88dab6b","Landscape Journal","1","10.3368/lj.30.2.173","http://lj.uwpress.org/content/30/2/173.short"

The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing ""out there"", but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban 'green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity-what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The conservation of insects is not a priority for most urban dwellers, yet can be accomplished in urban settings by the careful design of urban nature. Our goal is to foster cross-talk between practitioners of insect conservation biology who develop the knowledge base and professional design practitioners who are poised to apply this knowledge in designs and management plans for urban green space. The collaborative product promises a built environment that promotes human well-being and urban beauty while maximizing the potential for the conservation of insects. 2. There is precedence for collaboration between science and design communities to achieve conservation, and existing professional and civic organizations offer a structure to formalize and expand collaboration. Design professionals, particularly landscape architects, are trained to support insect conservation in the urban landscape through land planning and ecological site design. 3. Ecological site design is based in principles of sustainability and so must address the well being of humans and nature simultaneously. This powerful approach for insect conservation is illustrated in examples from around the world focusing on roadway-easement corridors, stormwater management areas, and greenroofs. 4. To improve insect conservation and its public support we offer recommendations, organized in response to cultural aspects of sustainability. Considerations include: a) social drivers for support of conservation practices, b) public perception of urban space, c) applying conservation biology principles in urban areas, and d) merging insect conservation goals with human cultural demands.","10.1111/j.1752-4598.2008.00024.x","http://www.iflaonline.org/resources/policy/pdf/ifla_strategic_plan.pdf","Insect Conservation and Diversity","2","10.1111/j.1752-4598.2008.00024.x","http://www.iflaonline.org/resources/policy/pdf/ifla_strategic_plan.pdf"

Given the recent growth in biodiversity-friendly designs and management schemes, there is an urgent need for a synthesis of this fragmented research base to inform planners and decision-makers. We conducted a systematic multidisciplinary literature review (787 papers) and found that the importance of urban areas for general conservation is not convincingly supported by empirical research. Only few studies demonstrated that cities can directly contribute to conservation efforts, by hosting viable populations of rare or endangered species, or by providing green corridors for the passage of natural populations. From a social perspective, while several studies demonstrated that green infrastructure could provide services for people (notably cultural services), only few studies explored the role of species diversity per se. Our review also shows strong geographical, location and taxonomic biases in urban biodiversity conservation research that make generalisations difficult. It is a disturbing paradox that while research in urban biodiversity conservation is rising exponentially, the main motivations for conserving urban biodiversity remain largely untested and unproven. We thus propose a framework for promoting integrative urban conservation research to bridge those gaps. Together, these findings warn against expanding cities under green planning and call for enhancing biodiversity experience by improving the quality of existing green spaces throughout the entire urban matrix.

It is therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations. Objectives We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is judged. Methods We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of habitat can lead to large loss of species' occupancy. Results We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but the generalist bird species. Conclusions We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent, repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of the impacts of different forms of habitat loss. Reassuringly, the recommendations based on the scenarios presented are in keeping with received conservation wisdom: to prioritise larger and/or rarer patches.","10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7010366; https://paperity.org/p/79604955/metapopulation-modelling-of-long-term-urban-habitat-loss-scenarios; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32103856/; https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/416371/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010366; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/metapopulation-modelling-longterm-urban-habitatloss-scenarios/; https://core.ac.uk/display/81729650; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0","Landscape Ecology","3","10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7010366; https://paperity.org/p/79604955/metapopulation-modelling-of-long-term-urban-habitat-loss-scenarios; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32103856/; https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/416371/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010366; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/metapopulation-modelling-longterm-urban-habitatloss-scenarios/; https://core.ac.uk/display/81729650; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-017-0504-0"

They can support ecosystem functionality, including stormwater management, cooling and insulation of buildings, moderation of urban heat island effect, contribution to human health and habitat provisioning. In addition they provide habitats in areas deprived of natural wildlife areas, providing green corridors linking fragmented existing habitats, improve wildlife movement and dispersal, thereby increasing population connectivity and act as refuges for declining or rare species. Unfortunately populations living in urban areas continue to rise and are expected to reach 61% in 2030, which is likely to negatively impact urban green spaces. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. Additionally, feasibility analysis of the planting project of possible extensive green roof application in semi-arid climatic conditions of Cyprus was carried out. Positive effects of the plants on the roof are also discussed. Feasibility analysis was carried out for the NEU car factory management building which was planned as 820 m(2). The following plant species have been suggested for the vegetation of sustainable green roof system in Cyprus; Sedum angelina, Sedum spurium, Sedum glaucophyllum, Thymus vulgaris, Santolina spp., Gaura lindheimeri, Lavandula angustifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis. According to research results 820 m(2) of extensive green roof will cost approximately 37107 Euro. Under Cyprus climatic conditions, this cost analysis estimated that extensive green roof application would cost around 49 Euro per square meter. This research provides valuable information for the importance of green roof establishments within the Mediterranean cityscapes and also has suggestions of vegetation types and roof layers for future green roof projects for the Mediterranean region.

Pollination is one of the most affected ES in urban areas mainly due to the decline in urban green areas (UGAs) and other factors derived from urbanization itself. Considering this and the already existing global pollinator crisis, the aim of this work is the evaluation of urban green infrastructure as an opportunity for pollinator conservation. For that purpose, the ornamental vegetation of a medium-sized Mediterranean city (Granada, south-eastern Spain) was determined. The floral origin, phenology and floral traits of the conforming species and the pollinator species that they attract were analysed. Additionally, NMDS analysis were performed in order to determine if the ""Pollination Syndromes"" are a useful tool to actually predict the pollinator group attracted to a certain plant species. It was found that UGAs have huge potential for pollinator conservation as the major part of its ornamental species have an entomophilic pollination strategy. However, there is an imbalance in the availability of flower resources throughout the year. Hence, the addition of species flowering out of the main flowering season would be advisable in order to get a continuous supply of floral resources for pollinators. A current disproportion in the potentially attracted pollinator groups was also found out, being bees the predominantly attracted ones. However, results showed that the ""Pollination Syndromes"" are a tool with limitations at the moment and needs to be used with considerations. Thus, the specific plant-pollinator relationship should be determined through field work in each case-study. Further studies considering key factors such as urban connectivity and fragmentation would be desirable to ensure a comprehensive management for urban pollinators.","10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127621",NA,"Urban Forestry and Urban Greening","2","10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127621",NA

This framework makes two main contributions: 1) a top-down hierarchical segmentation approach, including connectivity-based spatial clustering (regional scale), stem-based initial segmentation (individual tree scale), and fine segmentation of overlapped canopy (canopy scale), is proposed to reduce technical difficulties and improve process efficiency; and 2) a modified node similarity calculation for normalized cut method aiming at segmenting overlapped canopy, which can effectively separate neighboring trees even if their canopies are overlapped, is proposed.

They found 8,367 published articles. Findings - This review identified the main countries and research institutions that operate in urban afforestation. In general, developing countries seek to understand the environmental benefits that urban afforestation can provide, demonstrating the importance of maintaining existing green areas in urban centers to promote the balance of the ecosystem. It depends directly on the flow of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructures in the city, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration, retention of particulate matter, mitigation of heat islands and reduction of surface runoff, directly favoring the health and well-being of the population.

Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces.","10.1007/s10531-022-02436-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131598858&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-022-02436-3&partnerID=40&md5=fe244014dac15f573b88b2836ece21b2","Biodiversity and Conservation","6","10.1007/s10531-022-02436-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131598858&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-022-02436-3&partnerID=40&md5=fe244014dac15f573b88b2836ece21b2"

In this paper, we review and summarize the published literature aiming to inform future research investigations in the growing field of wild bee functional ecology. Specifically, we: (1) review which functional trait-based analyses have been carried out on wild bees in cities thus far; (2) summarize which wild bee species traits have been considered; (3) evaluate any consistent wild bee trait-environment relationships (i.e. urbanization) across studies; and (4) synthesize findings and limitations to inform future research recommendations. We reviewed 48 studies based on a systematic Web of Knowledge search. We found consistent trait characteristics for 'nesting type', 'diet', 'body size', 'sociality' and 'phenology' across studies. More than one third of the studies were descriptive and the majority of studies were located in urban gardens in temperate Europe and North America, calling for more research from underrepresented geographic regions and from the entire spectrum of urban habitat types. Of these studies, only five analyzed functional diversity indices and three studies applied statistics to relate urban wild bee traits to urbanization factors. Future studies should consider trait-based statistics, and could incorporate functional trait-based ecological networks to examine network shifts across urbanization gradients. Our review suggests that we lack generalizable information about wild bee trait and urbanization relationships yet, making conservation recommendations challenging. Therefore, we propose more research that considers methodological recommendations to develop a comparable and comprehensive understanding of how urbanization affects the functional ecology of urban wild bees to link with specific urban conservation measures.","10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND607027541","Biodiversity and Conservation","2","10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-020-02003-8.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND607027541"

Although it is essential to rebuild broken corridors by land use adjustments, related discussions of spatially explicit delineations of to-be-adjusted lands and quantitative adjustment costs are rare. Based on a widely adopted minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, we simulated the potential ecological processes and identified ecological corridors in a rapidly urbanized city, namely, Nanjing, in eastern China. We then analysed the corresponding land use and cover changes (LUCCs) from 2000 to 2015 and quantitatively calculated the costs of rebuilding the indicated corridors based on the indication of the amount/spatial distribution of to-be-adjusted lands and their different standards of related adjustment. The results indicated that most obtained corridors were along continuous waters, but LUCCs still occurred within them; the spatial expansion of urban lands dominated, especially in the suburban areas and outer buffers of the ecological corridors. The rebuilding costs increased significantly, and urban land adjustments dominated these increases. Spatially, most costs were associated with suburban areas, and the costs increased obviously as the corridor width increased. Based on the comprehensive consideration of ecological suitability and economic rationality, we found that 200 m was the most appropriate width for rebuilding ecological corridors, as it can both meet the demands of local species and balance the local public budget. We explored methodologies used to identify potential ecological corridors and quantitatively evaluate the costs of rebuilding them, thus providing a basis for implementing practical and feasible land use adjustments addressing ecological suitability and economic rationality.","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109130","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133922855&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2022.109130&partnerID=40&md5=3d4ec41379bf3a0cd09f971aa7144da3","Ecological Indicators","4","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109130","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133922855&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2022.109130&partnerID=40&md5=3d4ec41379bf3a0cd09f971aa7144da3"

However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems.

However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.","10.3390/su14159788","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700794622?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=6Aj%2FQEY9Zq33xhOm7G2A4qJI4ko%3D","Sustainability","4","10.3390/su14159788","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700794622?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=6Aj%2FQEY9Zq33xhOm7G2A4qJI4ko%3D"

The application of legislative and policy instruments to environmental decision-making needs to be complemented with more site-specific, evidenced-based research and with regard to the biodiversity of the broader landscape. It is argued that such an approach will help determine more accurately the likely long-term environmental outcomes that can be expected from setbacks, offsets, buffers and corridors within urban landscapes. In examining the question of setbacks adjacent to development, various relevant examples of court decisions are considered. In addition, a range of recent research studies are used to show that riparian zones are ecologically distinct as compared with non-riparian bushland. In addition, riparian corridor width is shown to influence the composition of flora and invertebrate fauna communities, supporting the use of wide buffers to maximise biodiversity outcomes.

The analytic method used is based on developing a conceptual and theoretical framework of reference to review the literature on the main variables of the research: Green infrastructure, resilience, and urban sprawl. It is concluded that while it is difficult to find linear causality in a direct relationship among the variables of the analysis, it is supported by the existence of more holistic connectivity leading to the controlling of the urban sprawl. The analysis suggests that a holistic approach is required to build urban resilience based on green infrastructure by addressing a fuller range of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban spectrum of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban sprawl.","10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2; https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/endesu/v23y2021i2d10.1007_s10668-020-00623-2.html; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/37c86631-1c21-3ddf-a372-4baaf8c5838e/; https://www.scilit.net/article/937d681e288f3a36f24050e484e5d467; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2.pdf; https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprendesu/v_3a23_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ad_3a10.1007_5fs10668-020-00623-2.htm","Environment Development and Sustainability","2","10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2; https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/endesu/v23y2021i2d10.1007_s10668-020-00623-2.html; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/37c86631-1c21-3ddf-a372-4baaf8c5838e/; https://www.scilit.net/article/937d681e288f3a36f24050e484e5d467; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10668-020-00623-2.pdf; https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprendesu/v_3a23_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ad_3a10.1007_5fs10668-020-00623-2.htm"

However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.","10.1111/cobi.13308","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063593628&doi=10.1111%2fcobi.13308&partnerID=40&md5=731e74fa81635668dbb11ba544dbd0d6","Conservation Biology","2","10.1111/cobi.13308","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.13308; https://collaborate.princeton.edu/en/publications/conservation-value-of-small-reserves; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30843258; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30843258; https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13308"

Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - ""E-LAUD""-affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.

Human actions produce a progressive fragmentation of the vegetation, affecting its quality and persistence. Adequate consideration of this effect in environmental assessment is necessary, but is often lacking; project impacts are frequently considered negligible, despite being cumulative. The aim of this review is to analyse the literature on fragmentation and loss of ecological connectivity in vegetation, to identify the main impacts and how to mitigate them. A novelty is the linking of these impacts to the human actions that generate them, which facilitates their consideration in the environmental assessment. Vegetation clearing results in fragmentation, separating patches whose persistence will depend on their size, shape or isolation. Reduced flow also causes loss of connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Fragmentation and induced connectivity favour the entry of invasive plants. These effects become more significant when threatened species or habitats are affected. Mitigation measures need to be implemented to avoid, minimise, restore and compensate for these impacts; ecological corridors can combine all these types of measures. Monitoring is essential to assess the dynamics of restored areas, and to detect changes in vegetation or the entry of invasive species. Only proper consideration of these impacts in decision-making, and appropriate mitigation, can control the negative cumulative effects that are currently occurring.",NA,NA,"Environmental Engineering and Management Journal","1",NA,NA

Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01578.x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644659327&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-9993.2006.01578.x&partnerID=40&md5=44d1b144fa6b0c8e820ecb3499616b46","Austral Ecology","5","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01578.x","https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:82559; https://core.ac.uk/display/143853511; https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/13859; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01578.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01578.x/abstract"

In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management. Our results may inform the revision and development of urban biodiversity indicators in the post-2020 framework and of other initiatives that guide cities in contributing to local and global biodiversity goals.","10.1371/journal.pone.0235773","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343153; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32639992/; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0235773; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PLoSO..1535773P/abstract","Plos One","7","10.1371/journal.pone.0235773","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343153; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32639992/; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0235773; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PLoSO..1535773P/abstract"

Standardization is a major part of that process. But living systems cannot be standardized. They require diversity and some degree of redundancy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the cultural contest between the machine and the garden, the machine has definitely won, but if we do not make room for the garden again, our victory will be our own funeral. New Agrarianism seeks to encourage diversity of species on each farm and across farms within entire landscapes. But farmers cannot carry out the restoration of ecologically-oriented agriculture on their own. They need support from cities: 1) in the form of markets to sell locally-grown produce at prices that will support their work, 2) in a new understanding of ecosystems that focuses on inhabited spaces and not just wilderness, and 3) in an orientation that questions whether efficiency should be the paramount value of our culture. Finally, the transition to more biologically-diverse human settlements can come about only if economic incentives are modified to remove the unrelenting pressure on farmers to expand their operations or go out of business.","10.1111/ajes.12083_2","https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:ajecsc:v:73:y:2014:i:5:p:1007-1134; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12083_2; https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ajecsc/v73y2014i5p1007-1134.html","American Journal of Economics and Sociology","1","10.1111/ajes.12083_2","https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:ajecsc:v:73:y:2014:i:5:p:1007-1134; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12083_2; https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ajecsc/v73y2014i5p1007-1134.html"

The damage was so great that the regional government decided in May 1998 to finance a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research initiative with the objective of eradicating or at least minimising all of the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. This paper utilises a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to identify eight strategic measures aimed at providing policymakers with key guidelines on implementing a sustainable development model, in a broad sense.

The insect kills most species of ash tree (Fraxinus sp.) and its management imposes costs to plant health protection agencies, forest industry, private landowners and municipalities. The United States Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) has deemed existing regulation efforts in the United States to be ineffective and has removed federal regulations designed to limit the spread of EAB. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is also trying to determine if continued regulation of EAB in Canada is worthwhile. Here we show that the benefits of slowing the spread of EAB via regulation are likely greater than the costs of implementing regulation if it is minimally effective (i.e. more than 25% effective at preventing anthropogenic spread). To evaluate the economic efficiency of existing Canadian EAB regulations, we examined trade-offs between the monetary benefits of regulation and the costs of regulation. Specifically, we simulated the spread of EAB under various levels of regulation effectiveness and estimated the timing of EAB arrival and associated ash mortality in urban and rural settings. Delaying ash mortality via regulation also delays management costs, a benefit to ash tree owners/users. Our findings suggest that an economic justification to continue regulating the insect exists based on monetary costs alone. The net present value of regulation (benefits less costs) is estimated to range between $23 million to $240 million, depending on the level of regulation effectiveness. Additional environmental and social benefits not addressed here would likely increase the value of EAB regulation but appear unneeded to justify such efforts on allocative efficiency grounds.","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107126","https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ecolec:v:188:y:2021:i:c:s0921800921001841; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921001841; https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v188y2021ics0921800921001841.html","Ecological Economics","5","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107126","https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ecolec:v:188:y:2021:i:c:s0921800921001841; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800921001841; https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v188y2021ics0921800921001841.html"

We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity.

Urban ecological restoration represents the best approach to undertake damages to restore native ecosystem remnants fulfilling biodiversity but also social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants; however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature.","10.3389/frsc.2021.709357","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123222034&doi=10.3389%2ffrsc.2021.709357&partnerID=40&md5=dfc5e71b5b07818e8097de0bedb3b4f2","Frontiers in Sustainable Cities","5","10.3389/frsc.2021.709357","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123222034&doi=10.3389%2ffrsc.2021.709357&partnerID=40&md5=dfc5e71b5b07818e8097de0bedb3b4f2"

Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108847","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099233337&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2020.108847&partnerID=40&md5=191ef8a0c2951c677a29e2748466e127","Biological Conservation","2","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108847","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099233337&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2020.108847&partnerID=40&md5=191ef8a0c2951c677a29e2748466e127"

Although it is increasingly being recognised that the distribution of the human population affects whether a potential service translates into a realised service, this misses key steps in the process and assumes that everyone accesses ecosystem services in the same way. Here we describe a conceptual approach to ecosystem services in terms of movement and flows. We highlight that ecosystem service flows can be broken down into 'nature to people' (the movement of nature towards beneficiaries) and 'people to nature' (the movement of beneficiaries towards nature). The former has been relatively well described. Here, we explore the latter by reviewing research on human migration, animal foraging and landscape connectivity. We assess if and how existing theories might be useful in describing how people seek out ecosystem services. We consider some of the ways in which flows of people to nature can be measured. Such measurements may reveal which movement theories best represent how people seek out and access ecosystem services. Overall, our review aims to improve the future modelling of ecosystem services by more explicitly considering how people access potential services and therefore realise them.","10.3390/land10060576","https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutputs/the-flows-of-nature-to-people-and-of-people-to-nature-applying-movement-concepts-to-ecosystem-services(0ffc979d-60a4-44e7-b271-eb4c85905fd5).html; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F583331; https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/6/576/htm; https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/6/576/pdf; https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jlands/v10y2021i6p576-d565253.html; https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/984y8/the-flows-of-nature-to-people-and-of-people-to-nature-applying-movement-concepts-to-ecosystem-services; https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/38696950/2021_Land.pdf","Land","6","10.3390/land10060576","https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutputs/the-flows-of-nature-to-people-and-of-people-to-nature-applying-movement-concepts-to-ecosystem-services(0ffc979d-60a4-44e7-b271-eb4c85905fd5).html; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F583331; https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/6/576/htm; https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/6/576/pdf; https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jlands/v10y2021i6p576-d565253.html; https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/984y8/the-flows-of-nature-to-people-and-of-people-to-nature-applying-movement-concepts-to-ecosystem-services; https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/38696950/2021_Land.pdf"

Areas with no roads or little traffic (""roadless and low-traffic areas"") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.","10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z","https://paperity.org/p/16105300/roadless-and-low-traffic-areas-as-conservation-targets-in-europe; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=46d59675-1739-478a-be26-1881b4416c98; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3189408; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011EnMan..48..865S/abstract; http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:463892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947368; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113341241?q=(au%3a%22Selva%2c+N.%22); https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00267-011-9751-z.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/81852889; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947368/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z","Environmental Management","8","10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z","https://paperity.org/p/16105300/roadless-and-low-traffic-areas-as-conservation-targets-in-europe; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=46d59675-1739-478a-be26-1881b4416c98; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3189408; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011EnMan..48..865S/abstract; http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:463892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947368; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113341241?q=(au%3a%22Selva%2c+N.%22); https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00267-011-9751-z.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/81852889; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947368/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9751-z"

We identified research related to the refuge potential of a wide range of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of fire dams, urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species.

How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers' convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.","10.1007/s11355-020-00418-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083526953&doi=10.1007%2fs11355-020-00418-7&partnerID=40&md5=8864d1d666c363f3f5ba100bb0bef9bb","Landscape and Ecological Engineering","2","10.1007/s11355-020-00418-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083526953&doi=10.1007%2fs11355-020-00418-7&partnerID=40&md5=8864d1d666c363f3f5ba100bb0bef9bb"

Hedgerows are emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components. Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production, pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement, mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration, landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity. Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize, notwithstanding regional character.","10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-012120-100346","https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/hedgerows-as-ecosystems-service-delivery-management-and-restorati; https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-012120-100346","Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Vol 51, 2020","3","10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-012120-100346","https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/hedgerows-as-ecosystems-service-delivery-management-and-restorati; https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-012120-100346"

Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class ""wood sites"" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

When hydrothermal activity ceases, biota endemic to hydrothermally active habitats are lost, and a new biota colonise these sites. Little is known about the biota colonising hydrothermally inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR, although these sites may be the target of deep-sea mining within the next decade. In this review, we seek to clarify the current knowledge of biological communities colonising hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR. To achieve this, we (1) used a systematic review process to update the species list of benthic invertebrates associated with hydrothermally active habitats, (2) conducted a regional biogeographic analysis of hydrothermally active vent fields on the nMAR, (3) undertook a comprehensive literature review to provide a descriptive account of biological communities, and (4) identified key knowledge gaps in the current understanding of nMAR hydrothermally active and inactive ecosystems. Our updated species list increases the number of benthic invertebrates recorded from hydrothermally active habitats on the nMAR to 158 taxa. Our regional biogeographic analysis separates nMAR hydrothermal vent fields into distinct clusters based on depth/latitude and chimney composition. Vent fields close to the Azores (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow) formed a separate cluster from those at greater depths south of the Azores (Broken Spur, TAG, Snake Pit, Logatchev, and Ashadze-1). Moytirra, located north of the Azores, clustered separately, as did Lost City with its unique carbonate chimneys. We present detailed information on the biological communities at hydrothermally active and inactive habitats in this region, and discuss the information available on the diversity, ecosystem function, trophic relationships, connectivity, temporal variability, and resilience and recovery of these communities. Many knowledge gaps still exist, with detailed information needed on all aspects of the biological communities at hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR to understand and predict impacts from natural and human-induced disturbances in the region.","10.3389/fmars.2021.657358","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114389303&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2021.657358&partnerID=40&md5=9526c764397a3e6316c254e27f8f9bd6","Frontiers in Marine Science","2","10.3389/fmars.2021.657358","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114389303&doi=10.3389%2ffmars.2021.657358&partnerID=40&md5=9526c764397a3e6316c254e27f8f9bd6"

The landscape's capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an decelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern.

Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.",NA,NA,"Environmental Management","2",NA,NA

Most real landscapes have topographical elements such as hills, valleys and urban developments, which can all act to modify a species' perceptual range and directly influence movement behaviour. If a visual-based perceptual ability enables a dispersing individual to locate suitable habitat patches at a distance, then it is to be expected that topographical features would act to modify the overall success of this strategy. However, the majority of individual-based Spatially Explicit Population Models (SEPM) employ only two-dimensional landscapes. To investigate the effects of topographical elevation on dispersal patterns, a three-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm was added to the dispersal rules of an individual-based SEPM. To explore the possible influences of a behavioural-based response to topography, an algorithm modelling valley-seeking behaviour was also developed. The performance of both algorithms was compared with that of a two-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm. The overall consequences of dispersal under each algorithm were measured by recording population sizes in a target wood in the centre of a modelled, real landscape. The size of the population in the target wood, modelled using both of the three-dimensional algorithms, exhibited sensitivity to the direction of dispersal in interaction with perceptual range, which differed from that predicted by the two-dimensional approach. Population size was dependant on the spatial configuration of habitat patches and on the topography of the landscape, both of which could guide dispersers either towards or away from the target patch depending on the particular combinations of dispersal directions and perceptual ranges selected. Topography was found to have a greater effect on dispersal at shorter perceptual ranges, and thresholds in the results for all three algorithms suggested the existence of species and landscape dependant optimal perceptual ranges. It is recommended that both topography and topographical-based dispersal-altering algorithms, commensurate with the studied species' behaviour, be incorporated into the movement rule-base of dispersal simulation models. The modelling of topography and its effects on movement in patchy landscapes are seen as essential ingredients in future landscape planning. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that: (1) Although the concept of Greenway was an adaptation from the Western World, the Chinese have a history of more than 2000 years of Greenway planning and implementation. Chinese Greenways have been called various names and were planned for various reasons. (2) The long history of Greenway planning and implementation in China was mainly a ""top-down"" approach, which, while very effective under a centralized administrative system, often lacked a scientific basis and significant public participation. (3) The functions of the Greenways were mainly protection and productive, with little concern for human uses such recreational uses of cycling and hiking. Greenways in China are discussed chronologically and in three categories: (1) Riparian Greenways run along rivers, streams and water channels. The history of these Greenways dates more than 2000 years, since a time when trees were grown along canals and city moats. They have in modern times evolved into a network of drainage channels. (2) Greenways along transportation corridors. These Greenways run parallel to state and provincial highways, railroads, country roads and urban streets and evolved from tree plantings along highways. Used exclusively by emperors, the green corridor networks have been systematically planned and constructed at a national scale and directly organized by the central government. (3) Greenways along farmland for wind protection. These plantings evolved from individual segments of windbreak rows to a network of protective windbreaks and the large, regional scale ""Green Great Wall"" project running along the northern edge of China. As Greenways have evolved in China, they reflect changes in ideology, utilization and scale; from protection of production or beautification to ecological and multiple uses, and from small-scale fragments to a systematic regional and national network. The occurrence of disasters, the involvement of state leaders and the influence of science played an important role in the evolution of Greenways in China. The paper also argues that: the traditional top-down approach in Greenway planning and implement should be integrated with scientifically based methods; recreational uses should be considered and integrated into existing and planned Greenways; the recently invoked ""city beautiful"", or cosmetic approach to Greenway planning and implementation should be stopped; and Greenways should be planned as an critical strategic element of ecological infrastructure at both the regional and urban scale during current rapid and extensive urbanization occurring in China.

We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation.

In addition, the 17% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation.

A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

Census data since 1991 shows that the total number of birds in Singapore has declined by 40 % and the number of species has declined by nearly 17 %. The most abundant bird species Is a migrant, the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva). The most important site in terms of bird population is Sungei Mandai, an unprotected mudflat and mangrove ecosystem while Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin are important in having the highest diversities of birds. The loss of mudflats through reclamation, damming of estuaries, and canalisation of rivers has resulted in a decline in waterbird density and diversity as shown in the Annual Waterfowl Census. The current total shorebird population in Singapore is only 4,000 - 5,000 birds, a vast decrease from the large wintering population of 10,000 birds at a single site, the Serangoon Estuary, in 1985. Forty-one of the 44 extinct species were resident forest birds, of which, 34 (82.9 %) went extinct between 1900 and 1950. This equates to 3.4 species lost every five years, an alarming rate of extinction for a small island like Singapore. The most susceptible families are the Trogonidae and Eurylaimidae, with 100 % species loss, and Picidae, with 56.3 % species loss. The susceptible bird families are predominantly those of the forest, whereas the resistant families exist largely in open country and scrub. In fact, only three extinct species were not largely dependent on tropical rainforests for their existence. Forest species such as the Green Broadbill (Calyptomena viridis) became extinct from the forests as recently as 1941. This emphasises the role that habitat destruction has played in shaping Singapore's avifauna. Fifty-four species of birds are at risk of extinction, of which 34 species (63 %) live in the forest. The remaining patches of forest in Singapore are mostly protected in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that should provide a safe haven for the forest birds. However, the forests are too fragmented, small and constantly disturbed by thousands of visitors. By connecting the smaller Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the much larger Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the forest patch size can be increased and might allow more movement of animals and plants between the two patches. Many forest birds are secretive or weak fliers and are reluctant to cross open spaces. A green corridor might encourage them to do so. Another 16 species (29.6 %) of threatened birds are specialists of mangroves and wetlands. Preservation of these most-threatened of ecosystems in Singapore is of utmost importance to the survival of the birds found in these special habitats. With improvement in the quality of habitats, we could perhaps slow down the rate of local extinction of the avifauna of Singapore. Our remaining habitats need to be protected and laws protecting wildlife must be strictly enforced, so that the birds may have a chance to coexist with us.",NA,NA,"Raffles Bulletin of Zoology","2",NA,NA

While billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore other coastal ecosystems around the world, there still is no successful model for restoring estuarine or marine ecosystems like the Salish Sea. Despite the lack of a guiding model, major ecological principles do exist that should be applied as people work to design the Salish Sea and other large marine ecosystems for the future.

Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration Simply expands the Scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial ""crops"" (e.g., crawfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are ""sources"" or ""sinks"" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and,, or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an ""easy sell"" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036935620&partnerID=40&md5=df39cd29d5a9aa52a526956a891cacb3","Waterbirds","1",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036935620&partnerID=40&md5=df39cd29d5a9aa52a526956a891cacb3"

These are adjoined by paths called as ?wildlife corridors' especially the tiger and elephant corridors which are used as a means for migration. Bandipur and Pench-Satpuda national parks have one such essential pocket of wildlife corridors the Bandipur corridor interconnects the population of 8000 plus elephants between Mysuru and Wayanad in southern India whereas the Pench-Satpuda corridor sustains 120 plus tigers between Pench-Satpuda Tiger Reserve in middle India. To assess this it's imperative to assess the pattern of wildlife movements, changes in the animal habitats in terms of habitat cluster zones, land-use changes, the onset of human settlements and anthropogenic activities are to be monitored. For this, land use land cover (LULC) changes for these corridors were analyzed across two decades using geospatial and remote sensing technique. The study finds a organized deprivation of dense forests and open forests respectively, thus indicating large-scale destruction. The study also found the net area changes of dense forests and open forests which were diverted for agriculture activities indicating extensive encroachment of forest land for human settlement. The classification was monitored for water bodies that have reduced, indicating shrinkage during the duration under research. The existence of substantial coal deposits in the wildlife corridor and operational coal mining in the proximity of the wildlife corridor is a matter of grave concern which has been highlighted in the research. We examine to identify long-Term sustenance and protection of such corridors for preserving the natural habitat. Thus, with such suitability in wildlife monitoring, we can mark an increasing need for adaptable, tenable, and secure wildlife management as illustrated under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15 mentioned under United Nations). © Author(s) 2022.","10.5194/isprs-Archives-XLVI-M-2-2022-233-2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136283347&doi=10.5194%2fisprs-Archives-XLVI-M-2-2022-233-2022&partnerID=40&md5=7ce64ff2d24fbb185846be7ac7afedf0","International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - Isprs Archives","4","10.5194/isprs-Archives-XLVI-M-2-2022-233-2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136283347&doi=10.5194%2fisprs-Archives-XLVI-M-2-2022-233-2022&partnerID=40&md5=7ce64ff2d24fbb185846be7ac7afedf0"

These functions may in turn benefit urban residents' physical and mental health as well as appreciation of real estates. Nonetheless, main ecological corridor construction methods developed by foreign scholars have not internally considered the movement and habitat characteristics of birds, while corridor research for birds by domestic scholars have focused on explorations of foreign technical methods yet lacked enough knowledge on studied birds' characteristics. Therefore, there is still much room for improvement in the study of urban ecological corridor construction from the perspective of birds. Based on the analyses of domestic and foreign related research from 1975 to 2020, we identified seven corridor construction methods and three corridor optimization methods within which bird ecology can be integrated. The advantages, drawbacks, and applicable scenarios of all the methods were explored accordingly. Finally, we argued that the development of computational models, which could not only combine bird species' observation data and spatial movement data with landscape structures but could also possess efficient computation power as well as simulate corridor's ecological benefits, would be a trend for constructing ecological corridor for birds. © 2021, Science Press.

The ecological infrastructure construction reflects the concept of ecosystem restoration and collaborative environmental governance. It is an effective means to guide urban planning under the new urbanization background. Nowadays, macro-scale ecological infrastructure construction is relatively systematic at home and abroad, while the micro-scale is relatively lacking. Due to the small scale and lacking network, the ecological infrastructure construction in community and other small scale regions in China can not prevent the problems of rainwater waterlogging and non-point source pollution emerge. In this study, the Promoter Regions in Xiong'an New Area as the research object, a design method, and the technical process of urban micro-scale ecological infrastructure are established. (1) Based on the site's survey and theoretical research, analyze the site current condition, and consider the relevant factors such as natural factors, physical perception, psychological perception, and the ecological process to construct the ecological infrastructure system where “corridor as the bone, patches as the node”. (2) Identify the regional functional ecological patches, which includes major animal activities, migration, and conservation of plant diversity, to construct a systemic corridor connecting the whole city to provide multiple functions, a structural corridor to increase ecosystem services within the city, and a local functional corridor to infiltrate ecosystem services into the urban fabric. (3) Evaluate the expected effect of ecological infrastructure construction by residents' perceptions and annual runoff control rate.

While measures to promote bees have been investigated pre-dominantly in the agricultural or rural context, a wide knowledge gap persists with regard to the effectiveness of such measures within urban landscapes. In order to guide research addressing this lack of knowledge, the aim of this perspective paper is to give an overview of the recent research activities based on the published peer-re-viewed literature. While research on flower seed mixtures in general focuses on nutritional aspects, studies on plantings of perennial herbs are relatively limited to few plant taxa. Implementation of comparable case studies investigating the effects of tree plantings on bee populations is hampered by a lack of methodological standard-ization. The conservation value of providing nesting sites in cities needs to be further investigated, in particular concerning ground-nesting bee species. While several case studies indicate a nutritional supporting function of green roofs for urban bee populations, findings with regard to vertical isolation remain equivocal. Various factors driving bee diversity and population structure in the urban context at the local and landscape scale have been identified, the reported relevant landscape scale being represented by radii between 500 and 1000 m in most cases. Future study designs reflecting a continuous and complete gradient of urbanization will be helpful in com-paring results on bee promoting measures in agricultural landscapes (which are numerous) to urban settings (which are still encountered much less frequently). Studies looking into the genetic structure of bee populations with regard to urbanization so far represent only a tiny fraction of bee diversity, and the further development of molecular methods could yield novel tools for assessing the success of bee promoting measures in terms of habitat connectivity in the near future. © The Author(s) 2020.","10.5073/JfK.2020.05.07","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084124868&doi=10.5073%2fJfK.2020.05.07&partnerID=40&md5=4c829bc53bffd0a5c8de1118796a9326","Journal Fur Kulturpflanzen","2","10.5073/JfK.2020.05.07","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084124868&doi=10.5073%2fJfK.2020.05.07&partnerID=40&md5=4c829bc53bffd0a5c8de1118796a9326"

One hundred and fifty years after its commercialisation by the horticultural industry, the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) has become one of the most ubiquitous ornamental palm species throughout all temperate zones. Even though it has become naturalised in many parts of the world, colonising natural as well as managed landscapes, little is known about the vectors responsible for dispersal. This paper reviews the state of knowledge of vertebrate species utilising P. canariensis as habitat and those that feed on the palm's drupes and disperse their seeds. Globally, P. canariensis forms a major urban habitat for invasive species. The significant dispersers are canids and three families of larger volant birds (Artamidae, Columbidae, and Corvidae). The review demonstrates that the majority of vectors consume the fruit on the tree or on a close-by perch, thereby contributing little to medium or long range dispersal. A few avian and terrestrial species facilitate long-distance dispersal, even though they too deposit the majority of seed close to the source. The paper postulates a conceptual model where effective dispersal success of a horticultural plant is governed not only by the established factors of distance of dispersal quantity of seeds dispersed and seed viability, but significantly also by the ability of a vector species to span several habitat boundaries (e.g. from urban to production landscapes or remnant vegetation) and to deposit multiple seeds at tightly defined locations. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","10.1016/j.flora.2019.151468","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072267460&doi=10.1016%2fj.flora.2019.151468&partnerID=40&md5=2a62ecd42343d359ff40cce384cbaba0","Flora: Morphology, Distribution, Functional Ecology of Plants","1","10.1016/j.flora.2019.151468","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072267460&doi=10.1016%2fj.flora.2019.151468&partnerID=40&md5=2a62ecd42343d359ff40cce384cbaba0"

Ecosystem service function assessment has been promoted as a method to cope with climate change and build a green and livable living environment. Establishing a green space planning framework based on ecosystem service function simulation calculus has scientific guiding significance for objectively evaluating the service function of green space and building a sustainable green space network. Method: On the basis of summarizing the relevant research of scholars at home and abroad, this paper takes the shallow mountain area of Beijing as an example to construct a green spatial planning framework based on the assessment of ecosystem service function. Six functional indicators, namely, heat island mitigation, soil and water conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen release, climate regulation, biodiversity conservation and cultural recreation, were selected, and runoff was adopted. Coefficient formula calculation, MaxEnt model simulation and other methods were used to evaluate, identify the location of key green spaces of different service types in the region and propose suitable green space types. Finally, through the construction of recreational greenways and ecological corridors, green space links were strengthened and the layout of green space was improved. Result: The results showed that the spatial distribution of ecosystem service benefits of different types showed some differences. According to the service differences provided by different regions, seven types of green space were delimited, including wetland park, forest park, country park, urban park, geological park, scenic spot and ecological conservation green space. Six new green roads were added. In plain and shallow mountainous area, ecological corridors were constructed in villages and towns such as Hot Spring Town, Yanshou Town, Shisanling Town and Yukou Town, and linear green space for the purpose of protecting target animals was established. Conclusion: The aim is to strengthen the implementation of ecological priority development strategy in shallow mountain areas and promote the formation of sustainable green development mode. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify stream health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify and investigate the highest function and lowest maintenance “version” of an urban stream that is achievable given the context – varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecologic diversity, social contexts, and community values. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identification of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershedwide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117363038&partnerID=40&md5=16122df2c0c768cd05660906d31d6245","River Flow 2020 - Proceedings of the 10th Conference On Fluvial Hydraulics","2",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117363038&partnerID=40&md5=16122df2c0c768cd05660906d31d6245"

Here we present a quantitative synthesis of conservation genetics science in Latin America and its progress, focusing on evolving trends on different taxonomic groups, environments and markers. We reviewed 528 conservation genetics research papers published in 57 journals from 1992 to 2013. Brazil and Mexico were the most represented countries in the literature and there was a marked disparity between terrestrial (~64%) and aquatic-marine research (~36%). More than a third or the articles focused on plants (~35%) while the other (65%) were animal studies with a clear emphasis on mammals (35%) and bony fishes (24%). Most research (42%) addressed patterns of population structure, while 17% focused on genetic diversity issues and 14% focused on the description of novel genetic markers. Finally, although genetics has become an integral part of conservation biology, genetic analyses have often not been completely integrated into the development of conservation and management strategies and formal policies. We discuss the levels to which these types of studies can effectively contribute to biodiversity conservation in this region, and offer suggestions on how conservation genetic approaches may be used more broadly, enhancing the connectivity between scientists and policy makers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-017-1006-y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027861553&doi=10.1007%2fs10592-017-1006-y&partnerID=40&md5=a3277787f5793965e091347853204add","Conservation Genetics","6","10.1007/s10592-017-1006-y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027861553&doi=10.1007%2fs10592-017-1006-y&partnerID=40&md5=a3277787f5793965e091347853204add"

Salt marshes continue to advance science in these areas. Several functions of salt marsh ecosystems are considered services of high value to society, for example, primary productivity, denitrification, and biodiversity support. In urban and agricultural areas, especially bays with major ports, up to 100% of salt marsh area has been destroyed or converted to human uses (e.g., salt ponds, fish ponds, diked and desalted lands for agriculture). Pollution, canals, subsidence, and increasing rates of sea-level rise (with global warming) continue to threaten salt marsh quantity and quality.

However, other drivers deriving from the impact of urban development and increased human activity include • managing stormwater quality, • mitigating a risk of increased flooding, especially where there had been some previous history of them in the greenfield environment, • harvesting of rainwater and stormwater for potable and nonpotable use, • greening the urban environment to reduce the heat island effect generated by intensive urban development and increased pavements, and • improving the aesthetics of the urban environment to encourage a feeling of well-being in the community. These philosophies were developed in North America as Low Impact Development and later Green Infrastructure (which sometimes also assumes a consideration of energy management) in response to the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act (US). Planning may incorporate green roofs, rain gardens, swales, permeable pavements, wetlands, green spaces, and urban natural vegetation corridors. Britain adopted Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) techniques. In Europe, planners and local government respond to the European Union Water Management and Flooding Directives on a river basin basis. In Australia, similar policy developments took place under the philosophy of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). The components and drivers vary between communities, each choosing emphases appropriate to their catchments, infrastructure, seasonal climate, local water cycle, and social expectations. Cities in East Asia have been undergoing rapid urbanization over the past 40 years, often accompanied by increased flooding, especially in China. In 2013, China introduced new urban policies which included the concept of Sponge Cities where “stormwater can be naturally conserved, infiltrated, and purified” for potential reuse, thereby reducing flood risks and increasing water availability. Construction guidelines were issued. Thirty major cities are participating as pilot cities. Each is eligible for central government subsidies. In Africa, the term Water-Sensitive Settlements has been suggested as the WSUD approach as originally envisaged does not take cognizance of the “developmental” or “equity” issues, which are particularly important in developing countries that may have legacies from their colonial or apartheid past. Many countries are now beginning to consider the necessity for WSUD in their cities and settlements. Addressing technical integration problems, legislative constraints, social equity, and community acceptance will be necessary for them to develop Water Sensitive Cities. This chapter summarizes the history of WSUD adoption and examples of the approach that has been taken across the globe. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is defined as the ability of a complex system to cope with external stresses through adaptation and mutation strategies and to return to an equilibrium state (not necessarily equal to the original one). In particular, ecosystem resilience is based on the concepts of diversity (biodiversity), redundancy (ecological variability), cycles of adaptation (multiple equilibrium states), and interaction between spatial scales (hierarchy) and temporal (activation of different times responses). In an urban context with high soil sealing, such as historical centers, it is essential to find new methods and application techniques that will be able to integrate the use of natural solutions with artificial ones and increasing ecosystem resilience and urban ecological quality. In fact, in these contexts, the percentage of permeable and green public areas available is not capable of performing ecosystem functions: so, it is necessary to act on private property through green punctual interventions (such as green roofs and walls), that may become fundamental elements of the municipal ecological network. In fact, these actions bring benefits from several points of view (environmental, economic, building comfort, etc.) The aim of the paper is to study the relationship between technical aspects and urban policies, and, in particular, to resolve the main question: how to encourage private owners to invest in green interventions for improving buildings' efficiency and environmental quality? In this process it is important to define sustainable policies acting on private property that consider both individual and global interests.

Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation. Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation. A lay summary is available for this article. © 2016 The Authors.

It is therefore important to understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps, with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services; (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future. We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted, researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when developing research proposals and consider effective methods of knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/bs.aecr.2015.10.007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953791402&doi=10.1016%2fbs.aecr.2015.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=501e7e4aa67fd31bcd8f255dfc124f55","Advances in Ecological Research","27","10.1016/bs.aecr.2015.10.007","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953791402&doi=10.1016%2fbs.aecr.2015.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=501e7e4aa67fd31bcd8f255dfc124f55"

Roads physically replace wildlife habitat and often reduce habitat quality nearby, fragment the remaining habitat, and cause increased mortality through vehicle collisions. Much ecological research on roads has focused on whether animals are successfully crossing roads, or if the road is a barrier to wildlife movement, gene flow, or functional connectivity. Roads can alter survival and reproduction for wildlife, even among species such as birds that cross roads easily. Here we examine the suite of potential impacts of roads on wildlife, but we focus particularly on urban settings. We report on studies, both in the literature and from our own experience, that have addressed wildlife and roads in urban landscapes. Although road ecology is a growing field of study, relatively little of this research, and relatively few mitigation projects, have been done in urban landscapes.

The exact timing of these changes and the speed at which they will occur remain uncertain. It is also unknown whether some of the predicted changes will occur gradually or suddenly after a tipping point has been reached. These findings echo what we presented in the first edition of this book, published in 1995. Results of more recent studies on climate change and Texas include: • In 1997 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report, Climate Change and the States, that came to similar conclusions (EPA 1997). Its findings are summarized in Table 10.1. • A national assessment published in 2000, ""The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,"" added important points: The summer heat index (which combines temperature and humidity) will increase significantly, heat stress for people and livestock will be more severe, soil moisture will decline as precipitation decreases and evaporation increases, reductions in water supply and quality will pose problems primarily for urban and poor populations, the coastal zone will suffer significant loss of property and damage to ecosystems as a result of coastal flooding and erosion, oil refineries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway will be at risk from more frequent and more intense storms, and the health of urban populations will be impaired by an increase in smog-forming gases from fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2000). • Norwine and John (2007) concluded that South Texas by 2100 will be drier, hotter, and stormier. Barrier islands will have been lost, and saltwater intrusion will diminish water supplies. • A recent study by the U.S. Global Change Research Program emphasizes the risk of more intense droughts: ""The consensus of most climate-model projections is for a reduction of cool-season precipitation across the U.S. Southwest and northwest Mexico"" (NOAA 2008). The likely impacts for Texas fall within the range of changes predicted for North America by Working Group 2 of the 2007 IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2007): IPCC assigns ""very high confidence"" to stress and damage from extreme weather and rising sea level, as well as infrastructure, health, and safety issues (Table 10.2). Taken together, the findings about the expected impacts of climate change on Texas have not changed fundamentally over the last decade and a half, but the evidence is now more extensive and detailed. In contrast, the context for policy development has changed substantially. There are several reasons for this. First, decision makers have fewer excuses to defer action because of scientific uncertainty. Key questions that were controversial two decades ago have been resolved: Yes, warming occurs not only at the earth's surface but also at higher altitudes. Yes, increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies global warming. Only the regional distribution of precipitation and the exact timing of predicted changes remain uncertain and require more study. Second, climate change is no longer a distant possibility but is occurring now. ""Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases."" This is in sharp contrast to our 1995 assumption that the impacts of climate change would be felt only by 2030. Third, the overwhelming majority of scientists are confident that observed and predicted changes in natural as well as social systems are caused by human actions. (These three statements are based on IPCC 2007.) As a result, the urgency to act on climate change has increased greatly since 1995. The 2007-2008 U.N. Human Development report starkly makes the point: ""Climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century⋯ Looking to the future, no country - however wealthy or powerful - will be immune to the impact of global warming"" (United Nations Development Program 2007). In this chapter I briefly review policy development in response to climate change at international, federal, state, and local levels and then discuss policy options for Texas. Several of the preceding chapters also discuss policy issues related to their subject matter. Here I focus on concrete policy measures that should be taken by state agencies and on development of a comprehensive state climate policy. (Table Presented).

In his chapter, Robert Costanza clarifies concepts in ecological economics and shows that the assessment of the trade-offs among ecosystem services and between ecosystem services and other contributors to human well-being requires profound research with regard to the interconnections between humans and the rest of nature. He presents conceptual and empirical tools for making these connections and discusses the difficulties in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem services with reference to the Galápagos Islands. He insists that to achieve sustainability we must incorporate natural capital and the ecosystem’s goods and services into our economic and social accounting and our systems of social choice. In estimating these values, we must consider how much of our ecological life support systems we can afford to lose. Costanza defines sustainability as the amount of consumption that can be sustained indefinitely without degrading “natural capital”, here defined as “a stock that yields a flow of valuable goods or services into the future”; for example, a stock or population of trees or fish that can provide a flow or annual yield which is sustainable year after year. The sustainable flow is “natural income”; the stock that yields the sustainable flow is “natural capital”. Natural capital may also provide services like recycling waste materials or water catchment and erosion control, which are also counted as natural income. Since the flow of services from ecosystems requires that they function as whole systems, the structure and diversity of the ecosystem is a critical component of natural capital. Costanza emphasizes that the Galápagos Islands represent a huge asset for humanity just like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, both being producers of ecosystem services and having iconic natural features, and are large stores of unique biodiversity and a source of scientific knowledge about biodiversity and its role in the co-evolution of humans and the rest of nature. He sees the largest values for the Galápagos in the realm of “cultural” ecosystem services (i.e. conservation value) and only moderate importance for several other more “production”-oriented ecosystem services (but see the essay of Wolff and Gardener, who see great scope for a development towards a self-sustained Galápagos using its “production”-oriented ecosystem services in order to reduce the Galápagos dependency to the continent). In his chapter “Nature and the World: A Geohistory of Galápagos”, Christophe Grenier shows that the Galápagos archipelago is fully integrated into the World System geohistory and analyses the increasing connectivity of this once isolated oceanic archipelago with mainland America and beyond through a series of schematics. Globalization, that is the general geographical opening of every region on the planet that presents economic or strategic interests for transnational, international or national actors, is complete in Galápagos. He shows that the consequences of this growing geographical opening of Galápagos are enormous, whether direct or indirect. The archipelago is rapidly losing its singularity, not only from an ecological point of view but also culturally. The main actors concerned - the Ecuadorian state, regional institutions, island inhabitants, local and foreign tourism enterprises, etc. - consider Galápagos to be like any ordinary region, ruled by the same economic “laws”, seeking the same kind of “development” and with Galapagueños wanting the same lifestyle as urban populations from other parts of the world. For these reasons, many of the archipelago’s ecosystems are in danger. His geohistorical approach to the human history of Galápagos demonstrates that people are the main drivers of the archipelago’s recent natural history, by opening it to the outside world and a flood of introduced species. Putting geographic space at the core of conservation policy may help to find solutions to reduce the Galápagos geographical opening in a sustainable manner for the island population. This implies a change in the tourism model in order to shift from quantity to quality by reducing the number of visitors and organizing a real ecotourism; to stop fuel subsidies and promote alternative energy sources; banning further imports of motor vehicles and implementing public transport; controlling immigration; providing better local education and training; and improving the quality and availability of locally produced food instead of importing most of the food supply. In the final chapter Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener continue with the analysis of the present development of Galápagos and reflect on the problem of estimating the population and visitor carrying capacity of the Galápagos archipelago. It is argued that through the strongly growing tourism industry (9-10% economic growth per year), the process of habitat degradation, biodiversity loss and contamination is accelerated. While technological solutions for reducing the local ecological footprint (such as shipping waste away and improving quarantine systems) may slow this degradation process down, they will not stop it. An alternative model is proposed, which defines the development capacity (i.e. the number of people the archipelago may sustain) in terms of the archipelago’s potential for providing ecosystem services to its population of local residents and tourists (food, waste recycling and renewable energy). This increases selfsustainability and reduces dependence on the continental and the global market. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener; individual chapters, the contributors.","10.4324/9780203126790-28","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123147200&doi=10.4324%2f9780203126790-28&partnerID=40&md5=094e7251abaee2b4618eb5cfad2fee97","the Role of Science for Conservation","2","10.4324/9780203126790-28","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123147200&doi=10.4324%2f9780203126790-28&partnerID=40&md5=094e7251abaee2b4618eb5cfad2fee97"

Throughout human history, people have interacted with and shaped ecosystems for social and economic development (Turner et al. 1990, Redman 1999, Jackson 2001, Diamond 2005). During the last 50 years, however, human activities have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than at any comparable period of human history (Steffen et al. 2004, Foley et al. 2005, MEA 2005d; Plate 1). Earth's climate, for example, is now warmer than at any time in the last 500 (and probably the last 1,300) years (IPCC 2007a), in part because of atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) released by the burning of fossil fuels (Fig. 1.1). Agricultural development largely accounts for the accumulation of other trace gases that contribute to climate warming (see Chapter 12). As human population increases, in part due to improved disease prevention, the increased demand for food and natural resources has led to an expansion of agriculture, forestry, and other human activities, causing large-scale land-cover change and loss of habitats and biological diversity. About half the world's population now lives in cities and depends on connections with rural areas worldwide for food, water, and waste processing (see Chapter 13; Plate 2). In addition, increased human mobility is spreading plants, animals, diseases, industrial products, and cultural perspectives more rapidly than ever before. This increase in global mobility, coupled with increased connectivity through global markets and new forms of communication, links the world's economies and cultures, so decisions in one place often have international consequences. © 2009 Springer-Verlag New York.","10.1007/978-0-387-73033-2_1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951812901&doi=10.1007%2f978-0-387-73033-2_1&partnerID=40&md5=d58401c5d2cd4b738208aec911b66f35","Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in A Changing World","3","10.1007/978-0-387-73033-2_1","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951812901&doi=10.1007%2f978-0-387-73033-2_1&partnerID=40&md5=d58401c5d2cd4b738208aec911b66f35"

Unfortunately, resources devoted to nature reserves are scarce, therefore establishing an effective conservation plan is an economic issue as much as it is ecological. Spatial attributes have been found important to affect the protected species' migration patterns, genetic exchanges, outside disturbances, etc. To promote the survival chances of protected species, spatial coherence of the reserve should be taken into account when choosing reserve sites. This raises two important issues: (1) what spatial attributes a reserve should possess to be an effective reserve, and (2) how can we select a subset from a large number of potential habitat sites to optimally allocate limited conservation resources. Although existing studies in the biological conservation literature do not provide explicit information about specific effects of different spatial attributes on protected species, generally large, compact, and contiguous reserve configurations are believed to work better. In the last decade, especially in recent years, many linear and nonlinear models were presented in the literature to incorporate various spatial attributes of the selected sites and their computational efficiency was demonstrated using empirical or hypothetic data. This paper summarizes the recent literature in this area with a particular focus on the modeling methods that addressed spatial attributes of the selected sites using linear integer programming. Four major spatial attributes are considered: (1) connectivity, (2) fragmentation and distance between selected sites, (3) boundary length and compactness, and (4) reserve area and core and buffer zones. Earlier studies have addressed these issues using rule-based heuristic algorithms. However, it has been shown in the literature that this method is inefficient in terms of optimal utilization of conservation resources because solutions obtained from heuristic algorithms often deviate significantly from the true optimal solutions. The spatial attributes mentioned above can also be modeled using linear integer programming that involves yes/no type decision variables, and small to medium scale reserve design models can be solved conveniently using off the shelf optimization software to find exact optimal solutions, and therefore to guide the optimal utilization of limited resources. Unfortunately, currently available optimization software have limited capability in solving large size site selection problems and their computational efficiency may be a bottleneck in practice. Furthermore, most of the models that incorporate spatial attributes are deterministic in the sense that they do not consider the uncertainty in species' occurrence in potential reserve sites or the probability of urban development for potential reserve sites. Some other models incorporated both types of uncertainty but they excluded spatial attributes of the selected sites. Incorporating both uncertainty and spatial attributes emerges as a new and important research direction in this area. The paper also elaborates on potential research topics in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and related problems in China. Inefficient data, both on the species presence in potential sites and the cost-benefit values associated with individual sites may become an obstacle for applications of site selection models in real conservation practices in China.",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961115852&partnerID=40&md5=e2bd7929e4055fcf814c30e20dd8a934","Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica","1",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961115852&partnerID=40&md5=e2bd7929e4055fcf814c30e20dd8a934"

A variety of perspectives are considered, including the occurrence and distribution of plants and animals in relation to the landscape setting, urban matrix and gradients and the structure, size, age and connectivity of the habitats.Our review reveals that the information is heterogeneous - it differs between taxonomic groups, chosen approaches, scales and methods, and from city to city especially in various geographic regions. In particular, the effect of the landscape setting, urban matrix and habitat connectivity on the biodiversity of urban areas has not been considered insufficiently.

Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology. 2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach. 3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management. 4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain. 5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and, if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects. © 2008 The Authors.","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-50649118772&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2664.2008.01534.x&partnerID=40&md5=c60ad87c053c3d8d10b04b3ec356571a","Journal of Applied Ecology","4","10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x","https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F729be3a7-d7ae-451e-b070-b3007ada9a9c; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x; https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/20144119.pdf; https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/an-operational-landscape-unit-approach-for-identifying-key-landsc; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x; https://core.ac.uk/display/15469497; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01534.x"

Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 531 of them located in 105 countries, where they protect vast ecological and cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept, it has yet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer, and transition areas. The current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model, where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural, semi-natural, urban and industrial landscapes.","10.5840/enviroethics200830331","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57749091547&doi=10.5840%2fenviroethics200830331&partnerID=40&md5=2458c911e286a069ef5aea459384f878","Environmental Ethics","2","10.5840/enviroethics200830331","https://philpapers.org/rec/GUETLA-3; http://www.unesco.org.uy/mab/fileadmin/ciencias%20naturales/mab/articulos_RB/EnvironmentalEthics2008.pdf; https://www.pdcnet.org/enviroethics/content/enviroethics_2008_0030_0003_0251_0262"

However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These socially produced spaces themselves, and their internal and external connectivities, play an important role in the establishment and warranting of knowledge claims to specific interpretations of the natural world. Moreover, historically institutions such as botanical gardens not only displayed prevalent systems of taxonomic regulation; they also became sites for the investigation of order in the natural world. This paper investigates the relationship between David Moore's role as curator of Dublin's botanical garden and his delivery of an anti-evolution lecture in Belfast in 1874. For Moore, the structuring of the scientific garden and the botanical discourse attending plant life there revealed the workings of a beneficent designer and thus was a material expression of a natural theology. The classifying of plants into families, the orderly fashioning of the beds, the display of exotics in the hothouses all facilitated a particular reading of designed nature which confirmed his commitment to the existence of a divine designer, and this reading of nature was popularly translated in his Belfast lecture. © 2007 SAGE Publications.","10.1177/1474474007072818","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846471210&doi=10.1177%2f1474474007072818&partnerID=40&md5=8d10196095c4d789cafd3af1c64c15c6","Cultural Geographies","1","10.1177/1474474007072818","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846471210&doi=10.1177%2f1474474007072818&partnerID=40&md5=8d10196095c4d789cafd3af1c64c15c6"

The study looked at traffic circles, bulb outs, and raised crosswalks. After initial public support the project was stopped due to a change of heart among some residents who were directly impacted by the measures. • A collector street in Fargo, ND that was reviewed following intense neighbourhood lobbying to the Mayor and City Commission following the street being extended under I-29 to connect to a street adjacent to a regional shopping centre. Area residents were concerned about increased volumes and speeds, and difficulty in exiting from local streets onto the collector. The study looked at traffic management measures that did not involve vertical deflection. Initially supported by City Commission, a strong grass roots movement by area residents significantly modified the recommended plan. • A neighbourhood review in Saskatoon, SK was requested due to the proposed closure of a portion of a collector street by the City to expand the City's water plant.

Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probability that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats from timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goat is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.","10.2307/3802732","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033938461&doi=10.2307%2f3802732&partnerID=40&md5=1f0586cdf66cce2f035d39de2d3e17c3","Journal of Wildlife Management","1","10.2307/3802732","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033938461&doi=10.2307%2f3802732&partnerID=40&md5=1f0586cdf66cce2f035d39de2d3e17c3"

Several authors compare the green open spaces to urban islands, inspired by the island biogeographical theory. These isolated green open spaces constitute, as it were, insular spaces dispersed in the agglomeration and it is suggested that models of dispersion and biological exchanges are similar to the dispersion of vegetation on ocean islands, for example. In the perspective of conservation and restoration of open green spaces, the concept of green corridors or green links has emerged as an interesting alternative, not only to produce new urban green spaces but also to create a green urban network.

Settlement on floodplains and exacerbation of peak runoff from land-use changes have resulted in flood damage to human structures, leading in reaction to widespread efforts to control flooding through such measures as land drainage and construction of levees and artificial flood control channels. These measures increase flood hazard downstream and result in loss of valuable riparian and aquatic habitats. Similarly, human settlements along river banks may be threatened by natural channel migration, leading to ill-conceived bank stabilization projects, which eliminate riparian habitat. Environmental planning strategies to minimize these impacts include reducing stormwater runoff through use of permeable pavement, infiltration galleries, and detention basins; ordinances protecting urban streams and riparian corridors (from development, filling, etc.); prohibitions or restrictions on development on floodplains; retention of vegetative buffer strips along stream channels; maintenance of continuity of riparian corridors for wildlife and human use; use of alternatives to traditional flood control strategies; and release of flushing flows to mimic effects of natural floods below reservoirs.",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035163417&partnerID=40&md5=960f45978231ce2115592fa22cce0cef","Ecohydrology and Hydrobiology","1",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035163417&partnerID=40&md5=960f45978231ce2115592fa22cce0cef"

The invaders expect Nature to be picturesque and want to live right next to it. But they also want gardens and landscaping, and they want Fido to be free to roam without becoming coyote bait. Wildlife live by different rules. In report after report on recent encounters between animals and humans, police and wildlife officials point out that the wildlife are only doing what's natural-trying to survive-and that naive humans often increase the potential for conflict by putting food out for wildlife. The experts also note that the overpopulation of certain species is a sign of serious imbalance in the ecosystems in which they are found, and that it is people's intrusion that is most often to blame. So what's to be done? The first step, according to the National Wildlife Federation, is to recognize the impacts of sprawl. Low- density, auto- dependent development eliminates, fragments, and degrades habitat. Nesting and foraging sites are destroyed, food supplies and water quality are compromised, roads and power lines fracture corridors needed for movement, and the diversity needed to maintain a viable ecosystem is lost. Some species slide from threatened to endangered, while others overbreed.

Usage of 'corridor' in game management, island biogeography, and metapopulation literature focused on function, namely, the movement of flora and fauna from one area to another. A structural usage of the term arose in the field of landscape ecology as it developed in North America with the matrix-patch-corridor paradigm of landscape structure. 'Corridor' is now used to describe both the structural and functional aspects of linear landscape features, often implicitly, in a wide range of disciplinary literature. Lack of a clear and consistent terminology leads to confusion about the goals Or implied functions of corridors. Consequently, the manner in which corridors should be designed, managed, and evaluated is also unclear. Proper design and management of a corridor depends critically on a clear and explicit statement of its intended functions. If corridors are not designed to perform well-defined functions, the outcome may be disappointing, or even deleterious. The roles Corridors play derive from six ecological functions: habitat, conduit, filter, barrier, source, and sink. These ecological functions have been recognized widely and adopted by a number of disciplines, including conservation biology, wildlife management, landscape ecology, and landscape planning. We review briefly the history of the term 'corridor' in the context of conservation, catalog some of its definitions and uses, review the functions of corridors, and differentiate between the structural and functional aspects of corridors. We reject the notion of defining 'corridor' succinctly, because of the complex and multiple functions a corridor may serve. Instead, we suggest that conservationists and planners consider and document explicitly all of the possible functions of corridors when designing them. Addressing explicitly these functions when designing a corridor should eliminate much of the confusion surrounding their roles, and focus attention on establishing design criteria for corridors that function as intended. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","10.1016/S0169-2046(01)00155-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035974472&doi=10.1016%2fS0169-2046%2801%2900155-4&partnerID=40&md5=684c236458d13c841580ffe1b5cbb800","Landscape and Urban Planning","2","10.1016/S0169-2046(01)00155-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035974472&doi=10.1016%2fS0169-2046%2801%2900155-4&partnerID=40&md5=684c236458d13c841580ffe1b5cbb800"

Fewer than 6% of the papers in recent volumes of Conservation Biology described work conducted in urban, suburban, or exurban areas or studies in which human settlement was considered explicitly. For a variety of reasons, conservation has tended to focus on lands with a relatively small human presence, often dominated by resource extraction and agriculture. Urbanization is occurring in numerous biodiversity hotspots worldwide, however, and has been identified as a primary cause of declines in many threatened and endangered species. Suburban and exurban growth are affecting biodiversity in many places once thought of as too remote to attract such levels of development. Conservation biologists must address the issue of human settlement to enhance the habitat value of unreserved lands for native species, to increase landscape connectivity between reserves, and to mitigate adverse influences on reserves from adjacent lands. Conservation and restoration of native habitats in densely settled areas also have social and educational value.

The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1 717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36%, 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve.

As the city's only river, the LDR also provides important habitat for many of the region's valued fish and wildlife species. However, its long history of urban development and industrial activity has polluted and degraded the river, and significant habitat restoration is now required under federal and state law. Given the highly developed urban industrial setting of the LDR, habitat restoration projects tend to be small and opportunistic, with limited ecological value. At the same time, the LDR is home to several underserved urban neighborhoods, and restoration projects have the potential to bring significant social value to these communities. Maximizing this potential value together with ecological value requires a more strategic approach to restoration. Through a review of local and regional planning documents, I developed a list of community-defined characteristics that contribute to a restoration project's potential ecological and social value in the LDR. I then used these characteristics to explore the spatial distribution of potential restoration value in the river, creating a series of heat maps of potential value for each characteristic, and for overall potential ecological and social value. I developed six ecological metrics and eight social metrics, which I calculated for 511 waterfront parcels in the LDR. Results show more variability with positive skewness in the ecological index, and a more normal distribution with higher average values in the social index. Spatial analysis revealed higher ecological value in the northern, industrial section of the LDR, with particular dependence on the existing habitat network. Social value was higher in the southern section and as the river passes through residential neighborhoods. These results can inform site selection for future restoration projects in the LDR. Methodologies and results for individual metrics can be used to address project-specific objectives, while use of the complete collection can inform those restoration projects that seek to maximize overall ecological and social benefits in the LDR.",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1621408750?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=Du5fmrX0bH465xVo5U%2Bq0OUDRKw%3D","Proquest Dissertations and Theses","2",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1621408750?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=XefCuwWit%2B%2Fe6gw1WsObExEFiiw%3D"

However, urban green spaces, including green roofs, can also provide important pools of biodiversity and contribute to regional gamma diversity, while novel species assemblages can enhance some ecosystem services. Green roofs may also mitigate species loss in urban areas and have been shown to support a surprising diversity of invertebrates, including rare and endangered species. In the first part of this study I reviewed the literature on urban invertebrate communities and diversity to better understand the role of green roofs in providing habitat in the context of the larger urban mosaic. My review concluded that, while other factors such as surrounding land use and connectivity are also important to specific invertebrate taxa, local habitat variables contribute substantially to the structure and diversity of urban invertebrate communities. The importance of local habitat variables in urban green spaces and strong support for the habitat complexity hypothesis in a number of other ecosystems has led to proposals that “biodiverse” roofs—those intentionally designed with varied substrate depth, greater plant diversity, or added elements such as logs or stones—would support greater invertebrate diversity, but there is currently limited peer reviewed data to support this. In order to address the habitat complexity hypothesis in the context of green roofs, in the second part of this study I surveyed three roofs designed primarily for stormwater management, three biodiverse roofs, and five ground-level green spaces, from March until September of 2014 in the Portland metropolitan area. Beetles (Coleoptera) were sampled bi-weekly as representatives of total species diversity. Biodiverse roofs had greater richness, abundance, and diversity of beetle species compared to stormwater roofs, but were not more diverse than ground sites. Both biodiverse roofs and ground sites had approximately 20% native beetle species while stormwater roofs had only 5%. Functional diversity was also higher on biodiverse roofs with an average of seven trophic groups represented, while stormwater roofs averaged only three. Ground sites, biodiverse roofs, and stormwater roofs each grouped distinctively in terms of beetle community composition and biodiverse roof communities were found to be positively correlated with roof age, percent plant cover, average plant height, and plant species richness. These results support the findings of previous studies on the importance of local variables in structuring urban invertebrate communities and suggest that biodiverse design can reliably increase greenroof diversity, with the caution that they remain no replacement for ground level conservation.",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1811448434?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=pctRkfrW%2Fis97x6eKADwoh685%2F8%3D","Proquest Dissertations and Theses","2",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1811448434?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=uInD2A3Wew964h1nRbe6qVFaBqM%3D"

Unlike large predators, mesopredators are expanding their geographic range and are readily adapting to living in and around urbanized areas. Even though urban mesopredator research has steadily been growing over the last 45 years, the majority of this has taken place in large metropolitan areas in the Midwest, Pacific and Northeastern regions. Research in the southeastern US, especially Texas and within small, urbanized areas is surprisingly lacking. In eastern Texas, mesopredators commonly found in urban areas include coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats ( Lynx rufus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). As more natural habitats are developed, it is important to identify variables likely to influence the density, occurrence and detectability of these species in order to establish sound management strategies to mitigate potential human-wildlife interactions. A mark-recapture study was conducted to: 1) Determine if density, occurrence and detectability of coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks vary in predictable ways in response to urban landscape features, and 2) identify hot spots of high potential human-mesopredator contact.I utilized motion-activated cameras during summer 2013 and winter 2014 to determine how coyotes, bobcats, and red and gray fox respond to urban landscape features in the city of Nacogdoches and immediately surrounding areas. The mesocarnivore community in the study area was affected by a variety of urban landscape features and their presence, density, and detectability shifted seasonally, but was similar to studies conducted in larger urban areas in North America. Coyote and bobcat presence and detectability both differed seasonally and were primarily associated with natural cover. Gray fox presence was affected by low density of buildings, whereas red fox densities increased as distance to buildings and distance to urban edge decreased. Low density residential zones adjacent to large forested patches such as the southeastern and northeastern extremes of the study area may have the greatest potential for human contact with coyotes, bobcats, red and gray foxes.For raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks I conducted a live mark-recapture study during late August – early September 2013 and early – late January 2014 in both suburban (summer 1.76 km2; winter 1.23 km2) and urban (winter 1.37 km2) areas within the city of Nacogdoches, Texas. Densities of raccoons within urban habitat ranged from 7.0 – 59.0 / km2, ( x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), which is consistent with previous research, whereas I report the first density estimate of opossums in an urbanized area during the summer (4.8 ± 1.9 / km2) and winter (13.1 ± 7.5 / km2). At the urban site, raccoon density, presence and hot spots were tied to areas of greater road density with small forested patches and subsequent greater human presence whereas opossum occurrence and hot spots were tied to close proximity to water. At the suburban site, presence and detectability of opossums and raccoons was associated with proximity to water and near small forested patches.This research indicates that the mesopredator community does in fact vary in their density and occurrence within the city of Nacogdoches. Nacogdoches has one of the greatest densities (x¯ = 227 ± 0.46 ind/km2) of coyotes reported in the literature in both urban and nonurban areas. Densities of red fox (1.19 ind/km2), bobcats (x¯ = 0.57 ± 0.32 ind/km2) and raccoons (x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), were consistent with values reported for urban populations, while I also report the first population densities of Virginia opossum (4.8 – 13.1 ind/km 2) and gray fox (x¯ = 0.36 ± 0.19 ind/km 2) living within a small urban area.The ability to see how the densities of certain species changes throughout the landscape will help biologists, city officials and wildlife managers make important decisions regarding educating the public and reducing human – mesopredator contact and zoonotic disease transmission. The remarkable variability of these species to urban landscape features is a testament to their remarkable and seamless adaptability. However, I see the need to preserve or construct wildlife corridors within and/or on the edges of urbanized areas to facilitate the movements of mesopredators away from residential areas and possible human interaction. Although I provide new insights in the urban ecology to all of the focal species, there is still a lot to be learned in urban areas such as gray fox and opossum urban ecology.",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1664100185?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=FuYPvjBUImKKO8%2BdNB%2BNJT9tYXw%3D","Proquest Dissertations and Theses","2",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1664100185?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=vqiiMRBXn3JPOh4Bn4yu99rsM10%3D"

Janzen, in 1967, proposed that mountain passes are effectively higher in the Tropics than in temperate areas in terms of their effectiveness in limiting dispersal, creating greater opportunity for isolation of populations, and differentiation into new species. Here, I analyze quantitatively predictions derived from Janzen's theory via 1000 virtual species across South America covering all major environments on the continent, taking into account effects of environmental contiguity and connectivity, effects of seasonality, and presence of known biogeographic barriers (rivers, principally). Virtual species' distributions were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances in ecological space to 1000 seed points, and applying different thresholds of ecological similarity within which the species is allowed to disperse into adjacent pixels. Distributional areas were measured taking into account only mean environmental similarity across the year, and considering the effects of seasonality and known geographic barriers. The results illuminate the situation: distributional areas are smaller in temperate areas when only mean similarity is considered (contra Janzen), but the pattern reverses when seasonality and barriers are considered, confirming and clarifying Janzen's ideas regarding generation of greater biological diversity in tropical areas as compared with temperate areas.

This research study investigated the planning, design, use and management of urban corridors in many locations throughout the world. The hypothesis selected for the study was to determine if managed recreational use is compatible with habitat conservation and wildlife occurrence in open space corridor systems. To do this detailed site based surveys were conducted in Singapore and many completed corridor systems in the United Kingdom were investigated for selection criteria, design parameters and management practices. Other locations and corridors schemes were also researched in the literature and site visits were made to Australia, New Zealand, South African and America. The partially completed island-wide network of park connectors in Singapore provided a suitable resource for an on site assessment of recreational use, bird occurrence and corridor maintenance and management.It was determined that there was strong public support for and enthusiastic use of corridor trails and that good opportunities were available for improving biodiversity. Whilst there is still doubt on the viability of corridor resources to act as conduits for wildlife they are effective as wildlife refuges subject to habitat design. In cases where corridors are narrow or even partially disconnected continuity of recreational trails is considered important to achieve. For wildlife, such as birds, their general mobility tends to overcome minor fragmentation effects. The importance of the matrix that comprises the surrounding land adjoining the corridors was established for wildlife (birds), especially where corridors are narrow or are closely encroached by densely built developments such as city centres.

Since the Kit Fox has such a wide range, it is thought that many other federally and state listed species will be protected. Historic evidence has shown Kit Fox migration between these two core habitat areas. To keep the areas from becoming isolated patches of habitat, which inhibits genetic diversity and ultimately species survival, a corridor was proposed. ArcGIS was utilized to assess the viability and location of a potential wildlife corridor. Functions such as weighted overlays and neighborhoods were used to score and therefore indicate the best habitat area, the location of the corridor, highest development pressure areas, and priority sites for conservation. Further, a discussion on conservation tools is included to set up a “toolbox"" for protecting the corridor.Using the two ArcGIS algebraic functions, a corridor location in the eastern portion of the County was identified, which splits in two and reconstitutes in the northern part of the county. Upon corridor identification, development pressure was analyzed by the use of a weighted overlay and revealed high development pressure along the route 46 highway, which bisects the proposed wildlife corridor. Priority areas were determined by overlaying habitat values with development pressure values to determine the best habitat areas under the greatest development pressure. Those areas within the identified corridor under the highest development pressure were considered high priority sites. Conclusions were that antiquated subdivisions located directly in the path of the corridor need further study to determine their ultimate effect on the corridor; 46 highway is a high development area and those areas of the corridor which are crossed by 46 are in need of immediate attention for conservation; ground-truthing needs to be done to verify findings; and that a combination of conservation tools will be needed to effectively protect the wildlife corridor identified.",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2691814117?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=EjAKdmQojlOPf7nIyQzDjlUdTXc%3D","Proquest Dissertations and Theses","2",NA,"https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2691814117?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=%2F1InW5%2BlTjuw3q8A03HhIOl20m4%3D"

These two global change forcings have wide-reaching ecological effects that are projected to worsen in the future. Improving connectivity is a common adaptation strategy, but CC and LUC can also degrade planned connections, potentially reducing their effectiveness. We synthesize advances in connectivity design approaches, identify challenges confronted by researchers and practitioners, and offer suggestions for future research. Recent studies incorporated future CC into connectivity design more often than LUC and rarely considered the two drivers jointly. When considering CC, most studies have focused on relatively broad spatial and temporal extents and have included either species-based targets or coarse-filter targets like geodiversity and climate gradients. High levels of uncertainty about future LUC and lack of consistent, readily available model simulations are likely hindering its inclusion in connectivity modeling. This high degree of uncertainty extends to efforts to jointly consider future CC and LUC. We argue that successful promotion of connectivity as a means to adapt to CC and LUC will depend on (1) the velocity of CC, (2) the velocity of LUC, and (3) the degree of existing landscape fragmentation. We present a new conceptual framework to assist in identifying connectivity networks given these three factors.

We review and synthesize 370 articles published since 2005 on the quantification and effects of landscape connectivity on biodiversity. We find a notable change in the quantification of connectivity from structural to functional approaches, a rise in network approaches, and a decline in approaches based on metapopulation theory. Most studies (54 %) did not test for the effects of connectivity, but of those that did, 91 % found effects on biodiversity, with over five times as many positive as negative effects reported. These effects were largely consistent across levels of biological organization, despite diverse perspectives on movement and connectivity across these domains. Nevertheless, we argue that several outstanding issues need to be addressed to advance our understanding of the effects of connectivity and its importance for conservation. These issues include the need for greater emphasis on estimating connectivity effects, explicitly incorporating the problem of scale, capturing impacts of movement processes relevant to different levels of organization, proper accounting of uncertainty, and isolating connectivity effects relative to other issues influencing biodiversity.","10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6","https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6; https://paperity.org/p/77579505/divergent-perspectives-on-landscape-connectivity-reveal-consistent-effects-from-genes-to; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6.pdf","Current Landscape Ecology Reports","10","10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40823-016-0009-6"

Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human–natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change—habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions—and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities—landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags—that need to be tackled in future research.

In the first step of our approach, we created a cost surface that represented permeability of the landscape to movement for a suite of species. We randomly selected nodes around the perimeter of the buffered study area and used circuit theory to connect pairs of nodes. When the buffer was removed, the resulting current density map represented, for each grid cell, the probability of use by moving animals. We found that using nodes that were randomly located around the perimeter of the buffered study area was less biased by node placement than randomly selecting nodes within the study area. We also found that a buffer of ≥ 20% of the study area width was sufficient to remove the effects of node placement on current density. We tested our method by creating a map of connectivity in the Algonquin to Adirondack region in eastern North America, and we validated the map with independently collected data. We found that amphibians and reptiles were more likely to cross roads in areas of high current density, and fishers (Pekania [Martes] pennanti) used areas with high current density within their home ranges. Our approach provides an efficient and cost effective method of predicting areas with relatively high landscape connectivity for multiple species..","10.1111/2041-210x.12197","https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12197; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12197/abstract; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12197; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12197; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12197; https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12197","Methods in Ecology and Evolution","8","10.1111/2041-210X.12197","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12197"

However, the methods for quantifying resistance surfaces are varied and there is no general consensus on the appropriate choice of environmental data or analytical approaches. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic to highlight methods used and identify knowledge gaps. Our review includes 96 papers that parameterized resistance surfaces (sometimes using multiple approaches) for a variety of taxa. Data types used included expert opinion (n = 76), detection (n = 23), relocation (n = 8), pathway (n = 2), and genetic (n = 28). We organized the papers into three main analytical approaches; one-stage expert opinion, one-stage empirical, and two-stage empirical, each of which was represented by 43, 22, and 36 papers, respectively. We further organized the empir- ical approaches into five main resource selection functions; point (n = 16), matrix (n = 38), home range (n = 3), step (n = 1), and pathway (n = 1). We found a general lack of justification for choice of environmental variables and their thematic and spatial representation, a heavy reliance on expert opinion and detection data, and a tendency to confound movement behavior and resource use. Future research needs include comparative analyses on the choice of envi- ronmental variables and their spatial and thematic scales, and on the various biological data types used to estimate resistance. Comparative analyses amongst analytical processes is also needed, as well as trans- parency in reporting on uncertainty in parameter estimates and sensitivity of final resistance surfaces, especially if the resistance surfaces are to be used for conservation and planning purposes.","10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0","https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0/fulltext.html; https://www.umass.edu/landeco/pubs/zeller.et.al.2012.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0","Landscape Ecology","6","10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-012-9737-0"

Instead of focusing on theoretical issues surrounding the concept of connectivity, we describe a data-dependent framework for classifying these metrics. This framework illustrates the data requirements, spatial scales, and information yields of a range of different connectivity measures. By highlighting the costs and benefits associated with using alternative metrics, this framework allows practitioners to make more informed decisions concerning connectivity measurement.","10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0529:acgtcm]2.0.co;2","https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1540-9295%282004%29002%5B0529%3AACGTCM%5D2.0.CO%3B2; https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/3868383; http://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295%282004%29002%5B0529%3AACGTCM%5D2.0.CO%3B2; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295%282004%29002%5B0529%3AACGTCM%5D2.0.CO%3B2; http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0529:ACGTCM]2.0.CO;2; https://www.scilit.net/article/2057cc438e82dab1c829cf08f780754a; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1540-9295%282004%29002%5B0529%3AACGTCM%5D2.0.CO%3B2; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295%282004%29002%5B0529%3AACGTCM%5D2.0.CO%3B2; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002%5b0529:ACGTCM%5d2.0.CO%3b2/abstract","Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","4","10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0529:ACGTCM]2.0.CO;2","http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0529:ACGTCM]2.0.CO;2"

Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for biodiversity. However, existing algorithms for measuring biotic sound have been shown to be biased by non-biotic sounds in recordings, typical of urban environments. We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four acoustic indices (AIs): Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient. CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, while the AIs performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data. Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pre-trained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.","10.1101/248708","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/16/248708; https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10057890/; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/248708v1; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/16/248708.full.pdf","Na","12","10.1101/248708","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/16/248708.abstract"

We conducted a systematic review of published research on the ecology of lentic habitats in tropical urban areas. The review focused on understanding: (1) how much is currently known about the biodiversity of these habitats; (2) whether this knowledge is biased towards certain taxonomic groups and/or geographic areas; (3) what is known about the factors influencing their diversity; and (4) which ecosystem services urban lentic habitats provide. The review aimed to establish whether existing knowledge is sufficient to help guide conservation and provide evidence to policy makers of the importance of conserving tropical urban wetlands. We found 64 papers that addressed questions about the diversity and/or distribution of lentic ecosystems within tropical urban areas. Papers came from 15 countries, although almost half (45%) were from India; relatively few countries from Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, or South America were represented in the literature. Publication patterns revealed a growing interest in urban wetlands, but several biases and gaps were evident from the review. Firstly, papers generally focused on larger natural or semi-natural wetlands, with other types and sizes of lentic habitat under-represented in published work. Secondly, most papers focused on a single site, with a limited number of multi-site, city-wide, or landscape-scale diversity assessments. Thirdly, studies tended to focus on understanding the influence of water quality on diversity, with work assessing the influence of physical habitat or factors related to dispersal and connectivity very limited. Finally, work assessing the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in tropical urban areas remains narrow in focus, with few quantitative assessments of the relationship between ecological characteristics and ecosystem functions and services. We suggest a number of research focal points and approaches to help address these biases. Research is needed to improve understanding of the distribution patterns tropical freshwater species in urban areas and of the relationships between species diversity and a wider set of environmental and spatial conditions. Overall, there is a need for diversity assessments of tropical urban wetlands of all types and sizes, especially new and novel habitats, and scope for much greater adoption of ecosystem service concepts and evaluation tools to help emphasise the importance of these habitats.","10.1111/fwb.13981","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136454993&doi=10.1111%2ffwb.13981&partnerID=40&md5=614aa5880b35d2c842e1638a022a8d6f","Freshwater Biology","10","10.1111/fwb.13981","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136454993&doi=10.1111%2ffwb.13981&partnerID=40&md5=614aa5880b35d2c842e1638a022a8d6f"

Accordingly, MPMs now exist for over 3,000 species worldwide. These data are being digitised as an ongoing process and periodically released into two large open-access online repositories: the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. During the last decade, data archiving and curation of COMPADRE and COMADRE, and subsequent comparative research, have revealed pronounced variation in how MPMs are parameterized and reported.Here, we summarise current issues related to the parameterisation and reporting of MPMs that arise most frequently and outline how they affect MPM construction, analysis, and interpretation. To quantify variation in how MPMs are reported, we present results from a survey identifying key aspects of MPMs that are frequently unreported in manuscripts. We then screen COMPADRE and COMADRE to quantify how often key pieces of information are omitted from manuscripts using MPMs.Over 80% of surveyed researchers (n=60) state a clear benefit to adopting more standardised methodologies for reporting MPMs. Furthermore, over 85% of the 300 MPMs assessed from COMPADRE and COMADRE omitted one or more elements that are key to their accurate interpretation. Based on these insights, we identify fundamental issues that can arise from MPM construction and communication and provide suggestions to improve clarity, reproducibility, and future research utilising MPMs and their required metadata. To fortify reproducibility and empower researchers to take full advantage of their demographic data, we introduce a standardized protocol to present MPMs in publications. This standard is linked to www.compadre-db.org, so that authors wishing to archive their MPMs can do so prior to submission of publications, following examples from other open-access repositories such as DRYAD, Figshare, and Zenodo.Combining and standardising MPMs parameterized from populations around the globe and across the tree of life opens up powerful research opportunities in evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation research.

We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation in this understudied region. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, two percent (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a ~4,000 km national investment project, increased by 1,554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads grew rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90% oil palm 10% pulpwood) of which 74% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo.

In Europe, the use of wild edible plants is shifting from a subsistence activity to an emerging trend in high-end gastronomy. The environmental impacts of this shift are poorly known. Foraging is increasingly popular for personal consumption and commercially, not least in the Nordic countries where popularity is fuelled by the New Nordic Food movement. Here, we evaluate if this trend entails biodiversity conservation risks in Norway. In collaboration with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging, we conducted 18 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and we published an online questionnaire filled by 219 recreational and professional foragers. We enquired on what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. We combined these data with an assessment of foraging impact based on foraging pressure, ecological traits and conservation assessments. Our results show that 272 different wild edible plants are foraged and that this is mostly sustainable.However, some risks arise from the harvest of threatened plants, the potential spread of invasive species, and the overharvesting of extremely popular or ‘fashionable’ species. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment and the majority of foragers report to forage as part of a sustainable lifestyle. We suggest that careful encouragement to forage and the participatory development of local guidelines for sustainable foraging in Norway can enhance people-nature relationships while safeguarding foraged plant populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2021.09.27.461499","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/09/27/2021.09.27.461499.abstract","Biorxiv","5","10.1101/2021.09.27.461499","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/09/27/2021.09.27.461499.abstract"

Agricultural stakeholders primarily rely on labor-intensive, expensive scouting and molecular testing to detect disease. Spectroscopic imagery (SI) can improve plant disease management by offering decision-makers accurate risk maps derived from Machine Learning (ML) models. However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology &amp; Geology (SBG) satellite becomes available. This work presents a cloud-hosted architecture to streamline plant disease detection with SI from NASA’s AVIRIS-NG platform, using grapevine leafroll associated virus complex 3 (GLRaV-3) as a model system. Here, we showcase a pipeline for processing SI to produce plant disease detection models and demonstrate that the underlying principles of a cloud-based disease detection system easily accommodate model improvements and shifting data modalities. Our goal is to make the insights derived from SI available to agricultural stakeholders via a platform designed with their needs and values in mind.

The resulting novel ecosystems are usually characterized by species assemblages that have not occurred previously in a given area. Quantifying the ecological novelty of communities (i.e. biotic novelty) would enhance the understanding of environmental change. However, quantification remains challenging since current novelty metrics, such as the number and/or proportion of non-native species in a community, fall short of considering both functional and evolutionary aspects of biotic novelty. Here, we propose the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI), an intuitive and flexible multidimensional measure that combines (1) functional differences between native and non-native introduced species with (2) temporal dynamics of species introductions. We show that the BNI is an additive partition of Rao’s quadratic entropy, capturing the novel interaction component of the community’s functional diversity. Simulations show that the index varies predictably with the relative amount of functional novelty added by recently arrived species, and they illustrate the need to provide an additional standardized version of the index. We present a detailed R-code and two applications of the BNI by (1) measuring changes of biotic novelty of dry grassland plant communities along an urbanization gradient in a metropolitan region and (2) determining the biotic novelty of plant species assemblages at a national scale. Results illustrate the applicability of the index across scales and its flexibility in the use of data of different quality. Both case studies revealed strong connections between biotic novelty and increasing urbanization, a measure of abiotic novelty. We conclude that the BNI framework may help in building a basis for a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of global change.","10.1101/824045","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/30/824045.abstract","Biorxiv","9","10.1101/824045","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/10/30/824045.abstract"

Here, I present GreenMaps, a new tool that will permit a rapid initial assessment of the Wallacean shortfall for plants by building base maps of species’ predicted distributions upon which citizen science participation could contribute to spatial validation of the actual range occupied by species. The initial stages of GreenMaps have now been accomplished, providing a massive dataset of modeled range maps for over 194,000 vascular plant species. This will make it the largest and only global assessment of geographic distributions for plant species at scales relevant to research and conservation.

To be able to counteract this alarming trend it is paramount to closely monitor biodiversity at global scales. Because this is practically impossible with traditional methods, the last decade has seen a strong push for solutions. In aquatic ecosystems the monitoring of species from environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools at our disposal but in terrestrial ecosystems the power of eDNA for monitoring has so far been hampered by the local scale of the samples. In this study we report the first attempt to detect insects from airborne eDNA. We compare our results to two traditional insect monitoring projects (1) using light trapping for moth monitoring and (2) transect counts for the monitoring of butterflies and wild bees. While we failed to detect many of the same species monitored with the traditional methods, airborne eDNA metabarcoding revealed DNA from from six classes of Arthropods, and twelve order of Insects - including representatives from all of the four largest orders: Diptera (flies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Coleoptera (beetles) and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants). We also recovered DNA from nine species of vertebrates, including frogs, birds and mammals as well as from 12 other phyla.

We explore this question at a global scale by using data from 64,110 species of animals and plants to identify how many areas could qualify as KBAs under current criteria. We find that between 26% and 68% of the world’s terrestrial areas can be classified as KBAs, depending on the spatial resolution. The total area from potential KBAs increases drastically as more species are assessed, suggesting that if all species were included, virtually all land surface could eventually meet the biological requirements for becoming a KBA. In addition, KBAs lack a data-driven ranking system, thus assuming that all KBAs are equally worthy protection. KBAs are intended to be areas which are both of biological importance and manageable but the current approach largely sidesteps the biological component.

We further designed new tools to analyze the ecosystem structure of urban forests, including spatial clustering and abundance of native trees, and validate these tools in comparison to past methods. We show that city trees are significantly clustered by species in 93% of cities, potentially increasing pest vulnerability (even in cities with biodiverse urban forests). Further, non-native species significantly homogenize urban forests across cities, while native trees comprise 0.44%-85.6% (median=45.6%) of city tree populations. Native trees are less frequent in drier cities, and indeed climate significantly shapes both nativity and biodiversity in urban forests. Parks are more biodiverse than urban settings.

Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logic’s ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theory’s ability to model uncertainty.

The distribution and behavior of individuals is central to ecology, and computer vision using deep neural networks can learn to detect individual objects in imagery. However, developing supervised models for ecological monitoring is challenging because it needs large amounts of human-labeled training data, requires advanced technical expertise and computational infrastructure, and is prone to overfitting. This limits application across space and time. One solution is developing generalized models that can be applied across species and ecosystems. Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increase these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources. Retraining from the general model improves local predictions even when moderately large annotation sets are available and makes model training faster and more stable. Our results demonstrate that general models for detecting broad classes of organisms using airborne imagery are achievable. These models can reduce the effort, expertise, and computational resources necessary for automating the detection of individual organisms across large scales, helping to transform the scale of data collection in ecology and the questions that can be addressed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2021.08.05.455311","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/03/28/2021.08.05.455311.abstract","Biorxiv","22","10.1101/2021.08.05.455311","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/03/28/2021.08.05.455311.abstract"

Here we propose and apply a holistic framework to understand the distribution of large old trees, the formal regulations targeting the conservation of large old trees and the ways large old trees are present in the popular news in Romania. There were 4032 large old tree records in Romania most of the records being concentrated in the Central and North-Western part of Romania. The number of tree records decreases with the decreasing terrain accessibility. Almost 50% of the large old tree records are in areas not covered by nature conservation regulations and 2/3 of the terrestrial protected areas have no open access large old tree records, so far. We identified five formal regulations which could be relevant for large old tree conservation in Romania, however, only two of these explicitly targets large old trees. The lack of knowledge and interest, the lack of expertize, institutional capacity, vested interests (corruption) and inconsistencies within the regulations are the major barriers in the formal protection of large old trees. We also identified several opportunities for the local initiatives to protect large old trees, based on the current legislative frameworks. We identified 259 internet news targeting large old trees in Romania which reveals a wide range of values and concerns associated to large old trees at the level of the local communities. While discussing our results we highlight the benefits of a wider adoption of our approach for science, decision making and local initiatives to save large old trees.","10.1101/2020.03.24.004812","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/03/25/2020.03.24.004812.abstract","Biorxiv","4","10.1101/2020.03.24.004812","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/03/25/2020.03.24.004812.abstract"

The formation of such natural history collections, however, are not free from sociopolitical issues of immediate relevance. Despite increasing efforts addressing issues of representation and colonialism in natural history collections, herbaria have received comparatively less attention. While it has been noted that the majority of plant specimens are housed in the global North, the extent of this disparity has not been rigorously quantified to date. Here, by analyzing over 85 million specimen records and surveying herbaria across the globe, we assess the colonial legacy of botanical collections and how we may move towards a more inclusive future. We demonstrate that colonial exploitation has contributed to an inverse relationship between where plant biodiversity exists in nature and where it is housed in herbaria. Such disparities persist in herbaria across physical and digital realms despite overt colonialism having ended over half a century ago, suggesting ongoing digitization and decolonization efforts have yet to alleviate colonial-era discrepancies. We emphasize the need for acknowledging the inconvenient history of herbarium collections and the implementation of a more equitable, global paradigm for their collection, curation, and use.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2021.10.27.466174","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/11/02/2021.10.27.466174.abstract","Biorxiv","58","10.1101/2021.10.27.466174","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/11/02/2021.10.27.466174.abstract"

Overlap in the distributions of different drivers have important implications for biodiversity change attribution and the potential for interactive effects. However, the spatial relationships among different drivers, and whether they differ between the terrestrial and marine realm has yet to be examined.We compiled global gridded datasets on climate change, land-use, resource exploitation, pollution, alien species potential, and human population density. We used multivariate statistics to examine the spatial relationships amongst the drivers and to characterize the typical combinations of drivers experienced by different regions of the world.We found stronger positive correlations among drivers in the terrestrial than in the marine realm, leading to areas with high intensities of multiple drivers on land. Climate change tended to be negatively correlated with other drivers in the terrestrial realm (e.g., in the tundra and boreal forest with high climate change but low human use and pollution), whereas the opposite was true in the marine realm (e.g., in the Indo-Pacific with high climate change and high fishing).We show that different regions of the world can be defined by anthropogenic threat complexes (ATCs), distinguished by different sets of drivers with varying intensities. The ATCs can be used to test hypotheses about patterns of biodiversity change, especially in response to the joint effects of multiple drivers. More generally, our global analysis highlights the broad conservation priorities needed to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic change, with different priorities emerging on land and in the ocean, and in different parts of the world.","10.1101/432880","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/07/09/432880.abstract","Biorxiv","21","10.1101/432880","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/07/09/432880.abstract"

Nevertheless, estimation of biodiversity using ecological field data can be difficult for several reasons. For instance, for very large areas, it is challenging to collect data that provide reliable information. Some of these restrictions in Earth observation can be avoided through the use of remote sensing approaches. Various studies have estimated biodiversity on the basis of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). According to this hypothesis, spectral heterogeneity over the different pixel units of a spatial grid reflects a higher niche heterogeneity, allowing more organisms to coexist. Recently, the spectral species concept has been derived, following the consideration that spectral heterogeneity at a landscape scale corresponds to a combination of subspaces sharing a similar spectral signature. With the use of high resolution remote sensing data, on a local scale, these subspaces can be identified as separate spectral entities, the so called “spectral species”. Our approach extends this concept over wide spatial extents and to a higher level of biological organization. We applied this method to MODIS imagery data across Europe. Obviously, in this case, a spectral species identified by MODIS is not associated to a single plant species in the field but rather to a species assemblage, habitat, or ecosystem. Based on such spectral information, we propose a straightforward method to derive α- (local relative abundance and richness of spectral species) and β-diversity (turnover of spectral species) maps over wide geographical areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2020.11.04.367995","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/05/2020.11.04.367995.abstract","Biorxiv","20","10.1101/2020.11.04.367995","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/05/2020.11.04.367995.abstract"

Their assessment can be improved by the use of independent data but this can be difficult to obtain and prohibitive to collect. Standardized data from citizen science may be used to establish external evaluation datasets and to improve SDM validation and applicability. We used opportunistic presence-only data along with presence-absence data from a standardized citizen science program to establish and assess habitat suitability maps for 9 species of amphibian in western France. We assessed Generalized Additive and Random Forest Models’ performance by (1) cross-validation using 30% of the opportunistic dataset used to calibrate the model or (2) external validation using different independent data sets derived from citizen science monitoring. We tested the effects of applying different combinations of filters to the citizen data and of complementing it with additional standardized fieldwork. Cross-validation with an internal evaluation dataset resulted in higher AUC (Area Under the receiver operating Curve) than external evaluation causing overestimation of model accuracy and did not select the same models; models integrating sampling effort performed better with external validation. AUC, specificity and sensitivity of models calculated with different filtered external datasets differed for some species. However, for most species, complementary fieldwork was not necessary to obtain coherent results, as long as the citizen science data was strongly filtered. Since external validation methods using independent data are considered more robust, filtering data from citizen sciences may make a valuable contribution to the assessment of SDM. Limited complementary fieldwork with volunteer’s participation to complete ecological gradients may also possibly enhance citizen involvement and lead to better use of SDM in decision processes for nature conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2020.06.02.129536","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/22/2020.06.02.129536.abstract","Biorxiv","5","10.1101/2020.06.02.129536","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/09/22/2020.06.02.129536.abstract"

To support decision-making, many studies exist regarding the expected vegetation changes and the impacts of climate change on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess, in an integrated manner, the impact of climate change on the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of Crete and to provide a case-study upon which a cost-effective and climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete, as well as the factors that may have shaped these distribution patterns. We also evaluated the effectiveness of climate refugia and the NATURA 2000 network (PAs) on protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa that should be of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index, during any environmental management process. The highlands of Cretan mountain massifs have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity. They are also identified as biodiversity hotspots, as well as areas of high conservation and evolutionary value, due their high EDGE scores. Due to the ‘escalator to extinction’ phenomenon and the subsequent biotic homogenization, these areas are projected to become diversity ‘death-zones’ in the near future and should thus be prioritized in terms of conservation efforts and by decision makers. In-situ conservation focusing at micro-reserves and ex-situ conservation practices should be considered as an insurance policy against such biodiversity losses, which constitute cost-effective conservation measures. Scientists and authorities should aim the conservation effort at areas with overlaps among PAs and climate refugia, characterized by high diversity and EDGE scores. These areas may constitute Anthropocene refugia. Thus, this climate-smart, cost-effective conservation-prioritization planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.","10.1101/2020.03.01.971143","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/03/03/2020.03.01.971143.abstract","Biorxiv","6","10.1101/2020.03.01.971143","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/03/03/2020.03.01.971143.abstract"

This study examines four distinct statistical approaches, each of which utilises a different approximation to fit a Poisson point process. These include two Poisson regressions with either uniform weights or the more elaborate Berman-Turner device, as well as two logistic regressions, namely the infinitely weighted logistic regression method and Baddeley’s logistic regression developed in the context of spatial Gibbs processes. This last method has not been considered in depth in the context of Poisson point processes in the previous literature. A comprehensive comparison has been conducted on the performance of these four approaches using both simulated and actual presence data sets. When the number of dummy points is sufficiently large, all approaches converge, with the Berman-Turner device demonstrating the most consistent performance. A Poisson process model was developed to accurately predict the distribution of Arctotheca calendula, an invasive weed in Australia that does not appear to have been the subject of any species niche modelling analysis in the existing literature.

Managed honey bees in particular pollinate many crops, but also create honey and other bee products that are now of global economic importance. Key aspects of honey bee behaviour can be understood by observing hives. Hence, the limitations of manual observation are increasingly being addressed by new technologies that automate and extend the reach of hive monitoring.Here we propose a framework to classify and clarify the potential for sensor-assisted hive monitoring to inform apiculture and, ultimately, improve hive bee management. This framework considers hive monitoring approaches across three newly proposed categories: Operational monitoring, Investigative monitoring, and Predictive monitoring. These categories constitute a new “OIP Framework” of hive monitoring. Each category has its own requirements for underlying technology that includes sensors and ICT resources we outline. Each category is associated with particular outcomes and benefits for apiculture and hive health monitoring detailed here. Application of these three classes of sensor-assisted hive monitoring can simplify understanding and improve best-practice management of hive bees.Our survey and classification of hive monitoring to date show that it is seldom practiced beyond honey bees, despite the need to understand bumble bees and stingless bees also. Perhaps unsurprisingly, sensor-based hive monitoring is shown to remain primarily a practice of developed nations. Yet we show how all countries, especially developing nations, stand to gain substantially from the benefits improved sensor-based hive monitoring offers. These include a better understanding of environmental change, an increased ability to manage pollination, an ability to respond rapidly to hive health issues such as pests and pathogens, and even an ability to react quickly to the danger posed to insects and humans alike by extreme events such as floods and fires. Finally, we anticipate that the future of hive monitoring lies in the application of Predictive monitoring, such that a hive’s anticipated future state can be preemptively managed by beekeepers working iteratively with novel hive monitoring technologies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2022.11.15.516676","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/17/2022.11.15.516676.abstract","Biorxiv","2","10.1101/2022.11.15.516676","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/11/17/2022.11.15.516676.abstract"

We developed an original model to simulate the conditions for which an eDNA signal detects, or does not detect, an impact on a targeted (receptor) species in a given project area. The simulation has four consecutive steps. First, a deterministic model simulated the dynamics of the receptor population and their eDNA fragment concentrations in the environment. Second, random distributions of receptor organisms and eDNA fragment quantities at steady-state were simulated within the project area. Then Simple Random Samplings were performed for both the receptor and eDNA. Third, post-sampling processes (eDNA extraction, amplification, analysis) were simulated to estimate the detection probability of the species from sample plan characteristics (size of sampling unit, number of samples collected). Fourth, we simulated an impact by modifying the growth, mortality and mobility (null, passive and active) parameters of the receptor species, then determined if an impact was detected. Detection probability curves were estimated for a range of sample volumes fitted with a Weibull cumulative distribution function. An F-like statistic compared detection curves before and after impact. Twelve scenarios were simulated. A statistically significant impact was detected with eDNA when receptor species growth rate was halved, but only in cases of null or passive mobility. When the receptor experienced both reduced growth and increased mortality rates, an impact was detected in all three mobility cases (null, passive and active). Our results suggest that an impact could be detected using eDNA if both the population dynamics of the receptor and the dynamics of DNA shed into the environment are known. These results indicate that caution should be exercised with eDNA data for EIA, but the proposed framework provides a valuable starting point to improve interpretation of indirect observation methods such as eDNA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2022.12.15.520594","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/19/2022.12.15.520594.abstract","Biorxiv","4","10.1101/2022.12.15.520594","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/19/2022.12.15.520594.abstract"

While there is evidence that severe habitat fragmentation leads to evolution of reduced dispersal ability and that such decreased mobility is generally detrimental for species’ survival, it is unknown whether species adapt via a gradual loss in dispersal ability or via a sudden shift from frequent to infrequent dispersal between patches (i.e., a critical transition). Using a spatially explicit, individual-based modelling approach, we show that a small increase in inter-patch distance can generate an abrupt shift in plant seed dispersal strategy from long to short distances. Most importantly, we found that a substantial increase in connectivity between habitat fragments is required to reverse this loss of long-distance dispersal, due to an evolutionary hysteresis effect. Our theory prompts for re-consideration of the eco-evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation as restoring habitat connectivity may require restoration of much higher connectivity levels than currently assumed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2022.10.10.510956","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/10/11/2022.10.10.510956.abstract","Biorxiv","2","10.1101/2022.10.10.510956","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/10/11/2022.10.10.510956.abstract"

The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings.We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats (BatDetect). Our deep learning algorithms (CNN FULL and CNN FAST) were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Romania and Bulgaria by citizen scientists as part of the iBats programme and labelled by users of www.batdetective.org. We compared the performance of our system to other algorithms and commercial systems on expert verified test datasets recorded from different sensors and countries. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on iBats monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system.Here, we show that both CNNFULL and CNNFAST deep learning algorithms have a higher detection performance (average precision, and recall) of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets, when compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems tested. Precision scores for commercial systems were reasonably good across all test datasets (&gt;0.7), but this was at the expense of recall rates. In particular, our deep learning approaches were better at detecting calls in road-transect data, which contained more noisy recordings. Our comparison of CNNFULL and CNNFAST algorithms was favourable, although CNNFAST had a slightly poorer performance, displaying a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our example monitoring application demonstrated that our open-source, fully automatic, BatDetect CNNFAST pipeline does as well or better compared to a commercial system with manual verification previously used to analyse monitoring data.We show that it is possible to both accurately and automatically detect bat search-phase echolocation calls, particularly from noisy audio recordings. Our detection pipeline enables the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale, particularly when combined with automatic species identification. We release our system and datasets to encourage future progress and transparency.","10.1101/156869","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/29/156869.abstract","Biorxiv","19","10.1101/156869","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/29/156869.abstract"

We analyzed 129 studies of ecological networks published in the last decade and making use of shortest paths, and discovered a methodological inaccuracy related to the edge weights used to calculate shortest paths (and related centrality measures), particularly in interaction networks. Specifically, 49% of the studies do not report sufficient information on the calculation to allow their replication, and 61% of the studies on weighted networks may contain errors in how shortest paths are calculated.

Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling and are slow while molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. Here we present a fully automated sorting robot, which detects each specimen, images and measures it before moving it from a mixed invertebrate sample to the well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. The images are then used by a newly trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign the specimens to 14 particularly common, usually family-level “classes” of insects in Malaise trap samples and an “other-class” (N=15). The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4% (75-100%). In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure specimen length and estimate body volume. We outline how the DiversityScanner robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity. The robot generates large numbers of images that become training sets for CNNs once the images are labelled with identifications based on DNA barcodes. In addition, the robot allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples by only removing the specimens that belong to one of the 14 classes. We conclude that a combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","10.1101/2021.05.17.444523","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/10/27/2021.05.17.444523.abstract","Biorxiv","9","10.1101/2021.05.17.444523","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/10/27/2021.05.17.444523.abstract"

A key challenge, coined “the Holy Grail” in ecology, is to upscale this understanding in order to predict how natural or anthropogenically driven changes in the identity and diversity of co-occurring plant species drive the functioning of ecosystems7, 8. Here, we analyze the extent to which 42 different ecosystem functions can be predicted by 41 plant traits in 78 experimentally manipulated grassland plots over 10 years. Despite the unprecedented number of traits analyzed, the average percentage of variation in ecosystem functioning that they jointly explained was only moderate (32.6%) within individual years, and even much lower (12.7%) across years. Most other studies linking ecosystem functioning to plant traits analyzed no more than six traits, and when including either only six random or the six most frequently studied traits in our analysis, the average percentage of explained variation in across-year ecosystem functioning dropped to 4.8%. Furthermore, different ecosystem functions were driven by different traits, with on average only 12.2% overlap in significant predictors. Thus, we did not find evidence for the existence of a small set of key traits able to explain variation in multiple ecosystem functions across years. Our results therefore suggest that there are strong limits in the extent to which we can predict the long-term functional consequences of the ongoing, rapid changes in the composition and diversity of plant communities that humanity is currently facing.","10.1101/859314","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/29/859314.abstract","Biorxiv","33","10.1101/859314","http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/11/29/859314.abstract"

Large-scale distribution data for plants are, however, often restricted to either certain taxonomic groups or geographic regions. For example, range maps only exist for a small subset of all plant species and digitally available point-occurrence information is strongly biased both geographically and taxonomically. An alternative, currently rarely used resource for macroecological and botanical research are regional Floras and checklists, which contain highly curated information about the species composition of a clearly defined area, and which together virtually cover the entire global land surface. Here we report on our recent efforts to mobilize this information for macroecological and biogeographical analyses in the GIFT database, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits. GIFT integrates plant distributions, functional traits, phylogenetic information, and region-level geographic, environmental and socioeconomic data. GIFT currently holds species lists for 2,893 regions across the whole globe including ~315,000 taxonomically standardized species names (i.e. c. 80% of all known land plant species) and ~3 million species-by-region occurrences. In addition, GIFT contains information about the floristic status (native, endemic, alien and naturalized) and takes advantage of the wealth of trait information in the regional Floras, complemented by data from global trait databases. Based on a hierarchical and taxonomical derivation scheme, GIFT holds information for 83 functional traits and more than 2.3 million trait-by-species combinations and achieves unprecedented coverage in categorical traits such as woodiness (~233,000 spp.) or growth form (~213,000 spp.).

Therefore, the perceptions and attitudes of key decision-makers (farmers) and other stakeholders (non-farmers, including citizens and consumers of the products of permanent grasslands, and ES) need to be understood to ensure the sustainability of PGs and the ES they provide.

Yet, governments primarily focus on coverage, disregarding quantification of the other criteria. While recent studies have assessed global representation and connectivity, they present limitations due to: (1) limited accuracy of the World Database of Protected Areas used, as governments may report areas that do not meet the IUCN or CBD PA definitions or omit subnational PAs, and (2) failure to include human impacts on the landscape in connectivity assessments. We constructed a validated PA database for Tropical Andean Countries (TAC; Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) and used the existing Protected-Connected-Land (ProtConn) indicator—incorporating the Global Human Footprint as a spatial proxy for human pressure—to evaluate TAC ecoregions’ representation and connectivity. We found that just 27% of ecoregions in the TAC are both protected and connected on more than 17% of their lands. As we included human pressure, we conclude that previous global ProtConn studies overestimate PA connectivity. Subnational PAs are promising for strengthening the representation of PA systems.

In this context, connectivity modelling is increasingly important for effective conservation. Most previous studies on connectivity modelling are based on focal species, while fewer studies focus on models based on landscape naturalness or wildness. We propose a methodological framework for wildland network planning, which utilizes the results from wilderness mapping as input data for connectivity models. The least-cost model and circuit model are applied using Linkage Mapper and Circuitscape, with wilderness areas selected as source patches together with resistance values transformed from a wilderness quality index. Taking the Great Taihang region of China as an example, wildland networks are created and pinch-points are identified. We show that the selection of core patches and resistance surfaces have a significant impact on the resulting corridors. The wildland network could serve as an effective and efficient alternative to habitat network and supplement the protected areas network, especially when the species distribution data are lacking, or a rapid assessment is required. This framework for wildland planning could potentially be applied to fragmented landscapes across various countries to eliminate or reduce the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108679","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320720307370","Biological Conservation","3","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108679","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320720307370"

This complexity, and the logistical challenges involved in following dispersal for multiple species across multiple sites, make it challenging to infer the processes underlying metacommunity spatial heterogeneity. The goal of our paper is to present a robust quantitative framework for inferring spatial patterns across multiple ecological communities. Innovation Unlike numerous metapopulation studies that have inferred migration rates based on landscape connectivity metrics which take into account the spatial positioning of occupied and empty patches, metacommunity studies have relied on spatial predictors built without considering such information. Here, we introduce a novel method called the multi-species spatial network (MSSN) to detect and explain spatial variability in community assemblies using a graph-theoretical approach. The MSSN approach can be best described as a reconciliation between the spatial positioning of sites and their patterns of patch occupation. Main conclusions Our simulation and real data analyses showed that our MSSN approach was better at detecting spatial patterns within metacommunities than the commonly used MEM method (Moran's eigenvector maps). In addition, our proposed framework is also useful in estimating the levels of spatial connectivity for each local community. Finally, our framework is flexible enough to incorporate different types of functions, metrics and algorithms to detect complex spatial patterns.","10.1111/geb.12293","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12293","Global Ecology and Biogeography","3","10.1111/geb.12293","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12293"

Successful recolonization depends on the availability of dispersing individuals and the degree of landscape connectivity. The obvious implications of landscape connectivity for conservation biology have led to a proliferation of connectivity measures. However, general relationships between landscape connectivity and landscape structure are lacking, and so are the relationships between different connectivity metrics. Consequently, there is a need to develop landscape metrics that more accurately characterize the landscape with an emphasis on the underlying processes.

I propose a simpler view of the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness, the ‘habitat amount hypothesis’, and I suggest ways of testing it. The habitat amount hypothesis posits that, for habitat patches in a matrix of non-habitat, the patch size effect and the patch isolation effect are driven mainly by a single underlying process, the sample area effect. The hypothesis predicts that species richness in equal-sized sample sites should increase with the total amount of habitat in the ‘local landscape’ of the sample site, where the local landscape is the area within an appropriate distance of the sample site. It also predicts that species richness in a sample site is independent of the area of the particular patch in which the sample site is located (its ‘local patch’), except insofar as the area of that patch contributes to the amount of habitat in the local landscape of the sample site. The habitat amount hypothesis replaces two predictor variables, patch size and isolation, with a single predictor variable, habitat amount, when species richness is analysed for equal-sized sample sites rather than for unequal-sized habitat patches. Studies to test the hypothesis should ensure that ‘habitat’ is correctly defined, and the spatial extent of the local landscape is appropriate, for the species group under consideration. If supported, the habitat amount hypothesis would mean that to predict the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness: (1) distinguishing between patch-scale and landscape-scale habitat effects is unnecessary; (2) distinguishing between patch size effects and patch isolation effects is unnecessary; (3) considering habitat configuration independent of habitat amount is unnecessary; and (4) delineating discrete habitat patches is unnecessary.","10.1111/jbi.12130","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12130","Journal of Biogeography","1","10.1111/jbi.12130","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12130"

While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to 2013. Least cost analysis was the method most commonly applied. We found no implementation of landscape connectivity proposals generated by the studies (e.g. potential corridors) into real landscape elements to ensure the permanence and functionality of ecosystems. We identified four important niches for potential future research projects: a) connectivity and climate change, b) contribution of connectivity studies to restoration planning, c) connectivity and land cover/land use change modeling and planning, d) contribution of connectivity analysis in the provision of ecosystem services across landscapes.","10.1177/0309133315598713","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133315598713","Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment","4","10.1177/0309133315598713","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133315598713"

Simulated landscapes were manipulated to quantify the impact of changes to the amount, fragmentation and dispersion of habitat on a widely applied landscape connectivity metric, the probability of connectivity index. Index results for different landscape scenarios were plotted against the dispersal distances used for their calculation to create connectivity response curves for each scenario. Understanding index response to controlled changes in landscape structure at a range of spatial scales can be used to give context to comparison of alternative landscape management scenarios. Increased amounts of habitat, decreased fragmentation and decreased inter-patch distances resulted in increased connectivity index values. Connectivity response curves demonstrated increases in assessed connectivity for scenarios with continuous corridors or “stepping stone” connectors. The sensitivity of connectivity response curves to controlled changes in landscape structure indicate that this approach is able to detect and distinguish between different types of landscape changes, but that delineation of habitat and method of quantifying dispersal probability incorporate assumptions that must be recognized when interpreting results to guide landscape management. Representing landscape connectivity in this manner allows for the impacts of alternative landscape management strategies to be compared visually through comparative plots, or statistically through the parameters that describe connectivity response curves.","10.1007/s10980-014-0046-7","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-014-0046-7","Landscape Ecology","1","10.1007/s10980-014-0046-7","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-014-0046-7"

Dispersal across landscapes, or the movement of individuals or genes among resource patches, is critical for functional connectivity. Yet current connectivity modelling typically uses information on species location or habitat preference rather than movement, which unfortunately may not capture key dispersal limitations. We argue that recent developments in species distribution modelling provide insightful lessons for addressing this gap and advancing our understanding of connectivity. We suggest shifting the focus of connectivity modelling from locating where animals potentially disperse to a process-based approach directed towards understanding and mapping factors that limit successful dispersal. To do so, we propose defi ning species dispersal requirements through identifying spatial, environmental and intrinsic constraints to successful dispersal, analogous to identifying environmental dimensions that defi ne niches. We discuss the benefi ts of this constraint-based framework for understanding the distribution of species, predicting species responses to climate change, and connectivity conservation practice. We illustrate how the framework can aid in identifying potential detrimental eff ects of human activities on connectivity and species persistence, and can spur the implementation of innovative conservation strategies. Th e proposed framework clarifi es the validity and contextual utility of objectives and measures in existing connectivity models, and identifi es gaps that may impede our understanding of connectivity and its integration into successful conservation strategies. We expect that this framework will facilitate a mechanistic approach to understanding and conserving connectivity, which will aid in eff ectively predicting and mitigating eff ects of ongoing environmental change.","10.1111/ecog.01306","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01306","Ecography","4","10.1111/ecog.01306","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01306"

The Convention on Biological Diversity agreed in 2010 to have 17% of land covered by well-connected PA systems by 2020 (Aichi Target 11). We here globally assess, for all countries, the trends in terrestrial PA connectivity every other year from 2010 to 2018 using the ProtConn indicator, which quantifies how well the PA systems are designed to support connectivity. The percentage of protected connected land (ProtConn) has increased globally from 6.5% in 2010 to 7.7% in 2018. Oceania experienced the largest recent increase in PA connectivity, whereas Asia is the only content with a lower ProtConn in 2018 than in 2010. Globally, the relative increase in the percentage of protected connected land (ProtConn) is nearly twice that of the percentage of land under protection (PA coverage), due to clear improvements in the design of PA systems for connectivity in many regions. The connectivity of the PA networks has become more dependent on the permeability of the unprotected landscape matrix in between PAs and on the coordinated management of adjacent PAs with different designations and of transboundary PA linkages. The relatively slow recent increase in PA connectivity globally (2016–2018) raises doubt as to whether connectivity targets will be met by 2020, and suggests that considerable further action is required to promote better-connected PA systems globally, including the expansion of the PA systems to cover key areas for connectivity in many countries and regions.","10.1016/j.biocon.2019.07.028","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320719308225","Biological Conservation","6","10.1016/j.biocon.2019.07.028","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320719308225"

One common approach to this is relating raster surfaces to ecological responses, assuming that the characteristics emphasized by rasters are representative of the processes determining changes in the ecological responses being assessed. Consequently, choices made in the design and assessment of rasters affect our understanding of the relationship between landscape characteristics and ecological responses. We propose a six-step framework for informing the choices made in creating and measuring rasters for landscape analyses: (i) acknowledge ecological theory and conceptual paradigms, (ii) evaluate the fit of available data, (iii) assess the three facets of scale, (iv) recognize different sampling designs, (v) use proper conceptual models, and (vi) measure meaningful raster characteristics. We discuss how each step can benefit from a “functional” perspective, i.e., an explicit focus on the ecological processes under investigation. This is especially important for landscape analyses of habitat change, which are highly complex due to the many processes potentially involved. A functional perspective draws attention to common pitfalls in landscape ecology, while promoting more process-oriented research in the study of habitat change.","10.1007/s10980-020-01048-y","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-020-01048-y","Landscape Ecology","2","10.1007/s10980-020-01048-y","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-020-01048-y"

However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness. The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape. In contrast, empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness. To explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats. The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have complex effects on species diversity in competitive communities. When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.","10.1111/ele.13450","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13450","Ecology Letters","3","10.1111/ele.13450","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13450"

Targets for marine protection under the Convention on Biological Diversity have seen rapid growth in MPAs globally, with progress judged using targets for total area protected rather than evaluating growth based on the capacity to protect biodiversity. The value of a MPA network to biodiversity conservation depends on a range of attributes of both individual MPAs and portfolios of MPAs, which are not captured by simple area-based targets. Therefore, a clear and efficient set of metrics are needed to effectively evaluate progress towards building MPA networks, considering the representation and adequacy of protection for biodiversity. We developed a universally applicable set of metrics that can evaluate network structure in relation to its capacity to conserve marine biodiversity. These metrics combine properties of effective individual MPAs with metrics for their capacity to function collectively as a network. To demonstrate the value of these metrics, we apply them to the Australian MPA network, the largest in the world. Collectively, the indicators suggest that while Australia has made significant progress in building a representative and well-structured MPA network, the level of protection offered to marine biodiversity is generally low, with insufficient coverage of no-take MPAs across many bioregions. The metrics reveal how the current value of the MPA network could be greatly increased by reducing the prevalence of multi-use zones that allow extractive activities known to negatively impact biodiversity.",NA,"https://osf.io/t2835","Rprt","3",NA,"https://osf.io/t2835"

There are, however, lingering concerns about whether corridors work as intended and whether managing for connectivity in fragmented landscapes is even important for biodiversity conservation. In response, numerous manipulative and natural experiments have been conducted to test the effectiveness of corridors. Gilbert-Norton et al. Conserv Biol. 2010;24(3):660-8 (2010) reviewed such studies published between 1985 and 2008 and concluded that corridors are generally effective at increasing inter-patch movement. The authors noted a lack of studies measuring responses at the population and community levels, responses that would better approximate corridor effects on population persistence and aspects of biodiversity. Here I explored what new insights can be gained on corridor effectiveness from studies published in the last decade, particularly with an eye toward insights going beyond effects on inter-patch movement. Following the same selection criteria as Gilbert-Norton et al. Conserv Biol. 2010;24(3):660-8 (2010), I reviewed studies published between 2008 and 2018 that tested corridor effectiveness by comparing ecological response variables from patches connected and not connected by corridors. Analysis of effect sizes showed that corridors increase response variables, reinforcing earlier conclusions that corridors function as intended. Whereas the previous review mainly included corridor effects on dispersal, recent research shows support for corridor efficacy at a variety of levels of organization, from individuals to communities. These findings provide further support for the conclusion that efforts spent creating and maintaining corridors are worthwhile for biodiversity conservation.","10.1007/s40823-019-00041-9","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40823-019-00041-9","Current Landscape Ecology Reports","1","10.1007/s40823-019-00041-9","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40823-019-00041-9"

These and other predicted responses to habitat fragmentation are derived from theory, which ecologists have tested with empirical approaches ranging from observations to experimental manipulations. These empirical approaches have also identified areas of theory in need of additional development. For example, experimental studies of fragmentation have provided insights such as the key role played by the matrix surrounding fragments, the importance of edge effects, and the impacts of corridors linking fragments with one another. Much less clear, however, is the extent to which these theoretical and empirical studies – while advancing our conceptual understanding of ecological responses to landscape change – help guide management and conservation practice. We review lessons learned from landscape-scale fragmentation experiments and observational studies, present the results of a survey of fragmentation and conservation experts which probed for links and mismatches between fragmentation studies and conservation practice, and discuss how future studies can contribute to conservation practice. Our survey showed that respondents consider fragmentation theory and empirical studies and their findings important for guiding conservation and management practices. The survey also identified that there are disconnects between what is typically studied by fragmentation ecologists and factors that are central to the practice of biodiversity conservation, notably, community-based human dimensions (e.g., economic, social, health issues), policy and governance, ecosystem services, eco-evolutionary responses of species, and interaction of multiple threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We discuss how these disconnects can present opportunities for experiments to continue to provide valuable recommendations for conservation practice in fragmented landscapes.

Connectivity challenges and solutions tended to be context specific, dependent on land-ownership patterns, socioeconomic factors, and the policy framework. Successful connectivity implementation tended to be associated with development and promotion of a common vision among diverse sets of stakeholders, including nontraditional conservation actors, such as water districts and recreation departments, and with communication with partners and the public. Other factors that lead to successful implementation included undertaking empirical studies to prioritize and validate corridors and the identification of related co-benefits of corridor projects. Engaging partners involved in land management and planning, such as nongovernmental conservation organizations, public agencies, and private landowners, is critical to effective strategy implementation. A clear regulatory framework, including unambiguous connectivity conservation mandates, would increase public resource allocation, and incentive programs are needed to promote private sector engagement.

To be efficient, these actions need to be based on reliable estimates or predictions of landscape connectivity. While circuit theory and least-cost paths (LCPs) are increasingly being used to estimate connectivity, these methods also have proven limitations. We compared their performance in predicting genetic connectivity with that of an alternative approach based on a simple, individual-based \\""stochastic movement simulator\\"" (SMS). SMS predicts dispersal of organisms using the same landscape representation as LCPs and circuit theory-based estimates (i.e., a cost surface), while relaxing key LCP assumptions, namely individual omniscience of the landscape (by incorporating perceptual range) and the optimality of individual movements (by including stochasticity in simulated movements). The performance of the three estimators was assessed by the degree to which they correlated with genetic estimates of connectivity in two species with contrasting movement abilities (Cabanis's Greenbul, an Afrotropical forest bird species, and natterjack toad, an amphibian restricted to European sandy and heathland areas). For both species, the correlation between dispersal model and genetic data was substantially higher when SMS was used. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that the improvement gained by using SMS is robust both to variation in spatial resolution of the landscape and to uncertainty in the perceptual range model parameter. Integration of this individual-based approach with other developing methods in the field of connectivity research, such as graph theory, can yield rapid progress towards more robust connectivity indices and more effective recommendations for land management.","10.1890/14-1690.1","http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/14-1690.1","Ecology","10","10.1890/14-1690.1","http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/14-1690.1"

Conversely, intact areas with diffuse flow that indicate multiple connectivity options cover 55% of the state, including the majority of the desert and mountain ecoregions. This “strategy mapping” approach can be used to identify priority areas for conservation investment and suites of potential implementation mechanisms and partners, which in turn may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of connectivity conservation in this era of global change.","10.1111/csp2.12698","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.12698","Conservation Science and Practice","4","10.1111/csp2.12698","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.12698"

Some also have suggested dangers of corridors. We reviewed published studies that empirically addressed whether corridors enhance or diminish the population viability of species in habitat patches connected by cor- ridors. A randomized and replicated experimental design has not been used—and we argue is not required— to make inferences about the conservation value of corridors. Rather, studies can use observational or exper- imental analyses of parameters of target populations or movements of individual animals. Two of these ap- proaches hold the greatest promise for progress, especially if the shortcomings of previous studies are reme- died. First, experiments using demographic parameters as dependent variables—even if unreplicated—can demonstrate the demographic effects of particular corridors in particular landscapes. Such studies should measure demographic traits before and after treatment in both the treated area (corridor created or de- stroyed) and an untreated area (habitat patches isolated from one another). This approach is superior to ob- serving the demographic conditions in various landscapes because of the tendency for corridor presence to be correlated with other variables, such as patch size, that can confound the analysis. Second, observations of movements by naturally dispersing animals in fragmented landscapes can demonstrate the conservation value of corridors more convincingly than can controlled experiments on animal movement. Such field obser- vations relate directly to the type of animals (e.g., dispersing juveniles of target species) and the real land- scapes that are the subject of decisions about corridor preservation. Future observational studies of animal movements should attempt to detect extra-corridor movements and focus on fragmentation-sensitive species for which corridors are likely to be proposed. Fewer than half of the 32 studies we reviewed provided persua- sive data regarding the utility of corridors; other studies were inconclusive, largely due to design flaws. The evidence from well-designed studies suggests that corridors are valuable conservation tools. Those who would destroy the last remnants of natural connectivity should bear the burden of proving that corridor destruction will not harm target populations.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.98036.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.98036.x","Conservation Biology","2","10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.98036.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.98036.x"

By means of hierarchical and phylogenetically independent meta-analyses we reviewed habitat fragmentation effects on the genetic and biological characteristics of progenies across 179 plant species. Progeny sired in fragmented habitats showed overall genetic erosion in contrast with progeny sired in continuous habitats, with the exception of plants pollinated by vertebrates. Similarly, plant progeny in fragmented habitats showed reduced germination, survival and growth. Habitat fragmentation had stronger negative effects on the progeny vigour of outcrossing- than mixed-mating plant species, except for vertebrate-pollinated species. Finally, we observed that increased inbreeding coefficients due to fragmentation correlated negatively with progeny vigour.

Both temporal and spatial processes determine biodiversity responses to changes in landscape structure, and it is therefore necessary that all aspects of connectivity are considered together. In this perspective, we use a case study to outline why we believe that both the spatial and temporal components of functional connectivity are important for understanding biodiversity patterns in the present-day landscape, and how they can also help us to make better-informed decisions about conserving and restoring landscapes and improving resilience to future change.","10.1007/s13280-014-0588-6","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-014-0588-6","Ambio","3","10.1007/s13280-014-0588-6","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13280-014-0588-6"

We discuss psychological and socioeconomic factors that influence the degree of anthropogenic resistance, such as the economic value or the risks posed by a species, and suggest methods to estimate and include anthropogenic resistance in connectivity analyses. Finally, we highlight how addressing anthropogenic resistance through a social-ecological perspective can lead to better outcomes for both humans and wildlife.

A recent hypothesis advanced by Fahrig (2013) would, if supported, greatly diminish the relevance of habitat configuration as a predictor of diversity. The Habitat Amount Hypothesis posits that the sample area effect overrides patch size and patch isolation effects of habitat fragmentation on species richness. It predicts that the amount of habitat in a local landscape, regardless of configuration, is the main landscape-level determinant of species richness. If habitat amount is indeed the major, landscape-level driver of species richness, the slopes of the species-area relationship (SAR) for otherwise similar fragmented and unfragmented landscapes should be indistinguishable. We tested the Habitat Amount Hypothesis with data from two replicated and controlled habitat fragmentation experiments that disentangle the effects of habitat amount and configuration. One experiment provided time-series data on plant species richness and the other on micro-arthropod species richness. We found that, relative to less fragmented habitats, the SARs for fragmented habitats have significantly higher slopes and that the magnitude of the difference in slopes increased over time. Relatively more species were lost in smaller areas when fragments were more isolated. In both experiments, the proportion of species lost due to increased habitat fragmentation was nearly identical to the proportion lost due to reduced habitat amount. Our results provide a direct and experimentally derived refutation of the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, supporting the long-held view that in addition to area, patch isolation and configuration are important determinants of species richness. Differences in species richness between fragmented and non-fragmented habitats increase over time, demonstrating that long-term studies are needed to understand the effects of fragmentation, above and beyond the amount of habitat lost.

Specifically, whether corridors increase movement of plants and animals between habitat fragments has been addressed on a case-by-case basis with mixed results. Because of the growing number of well-designed experiments that have addressed this question, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether corridors increase movement; whether corridor effectiveness differs among taxa; how recent changes in experimental design have influenced findings; and whether corridor effectiveness differs between manipulative and natural experiments. To conduct our meta-analysis, we analyzed 78 experiments from 35 studies using a conservative hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for hierarchical and sampling dependence. We found a highly significant result that corridors increase movement between habitat patches by approximately 50% compared to patches that are not connected with corridors. We found that corridors were more important for the movement of invertebrates, nonavian vertebrates, and plants than they were for birds. Recent methodological advances in corridor experiments, such as controlling for the area added by corridors, did not influence whether corridors increased movement, whereas controlling for the distance between source and connected or unconnected recipient patches decreased movement through corridors. After controlling for taxa differences and whether studies controlled for distance in experimental design, we found that natural corridors (those existing in landscapes prior to the study) showed more movement than manipulated corridors (those created and maintained for the study). Our results suggest that existing corridors increase species movement in fragmented landscapes and that efforts spent on maintaining and creating corridors are worthwhile.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01450.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01450.x","Conservation Biology","4","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01450.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01450.x"

Following the description of effects, we provide a summary of the best practices for managing the impacts of linear barriers. Globally, many corridors are established in the flood plains of stream and rivers and occur in riparian areas associated with surface waters. Therefore, we next provide guidance on how to manage corridors that occur in riparian areas. We then segue into corridors and the urban/suburban environment, and summarize strategies for dealing with urban development within corridors. The final major anthropic land use that may affect corridor management is cultivation and grazing agriculture.

For example, planners might design a linkage between two conserved areas, or the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity might set targets for a well-connected system of protected areas for each nation. Here we describe 35 metrics that can quantify connectivity of focal patches or of networks and monitor changes over time in an ecoscape (landscape or seascape). The connectivity metrics fall into four categories: (1) structural connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-nonspecific spatial functions, (2) connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-specific population sizes and dispersal functions (3) metrics derived from multi-state maps and species responses to those states, and (4) metrics of functional connectivity reflecting observed flow of organisms or genes. We provide a decision tree to select which of these metrics are most appropriate for a given conservation goal and broad ecoscape context. Functional connectivity metrics may be preferred if conservation is focused on particular species or if data are available to parameterize models for a suite of species that represent needs of the focal biota. However, with climate change, ecoscapes need to facilitate movements of all species that need to adapt by shifting their ranges. Because an intact network of relatively natural areas may support movement for many species, structural metrics that consider the human footprint should be used in all coarse filter approximations of functional connectivity in shared ecoscapes.","10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109008","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320721000604","Biological Conservation","3","10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109008","https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320721000604"

Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996–2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.","10.1088/1748-9326/aacb85","https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacb85","Environmental Research Letters","8","10.1088/1748-9326/aacb85","https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacb85"

It is commonly accepted that the matrix plays a role in determining connectivity; however, it is not clear how the process of assessing connectivity is impacted by different ways in which the matrix may be represented, particularly if matrix structure is generalized to expedite analysis. We conducted a controlled experiment using computer simulations to evaluate the impact of increasing levels of matrix generalization on connectivity assessment using a constant arrangement of habitat patches. We varied matrix generalization for six simulated landscape patterns by adjusting the number of classes and level of pattern grain in 16 ways to yield sets of landscapes for which the matrix ranged from not generalized (i.e., heterogeneous) to completely generalized (i.e., homogeneous) while habitat placement was held constant. Least-cost paths were calculated for each landscape, and a spatial interaction model (SIM) was implemented to model the counts of patch inflows (immigration) and pairwise exchange. Applying a SIM allowed us to generate absolute outputs and explicitly compare the effect of changes to matrix generalization on connectivity. We found that both assessment of connections (i.e., measured distance and spatial delineation of least-cost paths) and patch inflows/pairwise exchange were highly sensitive to matrix generalization and that effects were inconsistent and unpredictable across the range of matrix representations, especially when estimating connectivity for individual patches. We conclude that matrix pattern may have an underappreciated effect on connectivity and that least-cost path delineation and connectivity assessment may be very sensitive to generalizations of the matrix. We suggest that sensitivity analysis of the matrix representation should be performed when conducting connectivity analyses.","10.1007/s12080-017-0351-2","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12080-017-0351-2","Theoretical Ecology","2","10.1007/s12080-017-0351-2","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12080-017-0351-2"

Least-cost models are used to identify areas that support long-distance movement. These models rely on estimates of landscape resistance, which are typically derived from habitat suitability. We examine two key steps in estimating resistance from habitat suitability: choosing a procedure to estimate habitat suitability, and choosing a transformation function to translate habitat suitability into resistance. We used linear and nonlinear functions to convert three types of habitat suitability estimates (from expert opinion, resource selection functions, and step selection functions) into resistances for elk (Cervus canadensis) and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). We evaluated the resulting resistance maps on an independent set of observed long-distance, prospecting movements. A negative exponential function best described the relationship between resistance values and habitat suitability for desert bighorn sheep indicating long-distance movers readily travel through moderately-suitable areas and avoid only the least suitable habitat. For desert bighorn sheep, all three suitability estimates performed better than chance, and resource and step selection functions outperformed expert opinion. For elk, all three suitability estimates performed the same as chance. When designing corridors to facilitate long-distance movements of mobile animals, we recommend transforming habitat suitability into resistance with a negative exponential function. Use of an exponential transformation means that larger fractions of the landscape offer low resistance, allowing greater flexibility in where a corridor is located.","10.1007/s10980-016-0387-5","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-016-0387-5","Landscape Ecology","3","10.1007/s10980-016-0387-5","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-016-0387-5"

Traditionally, conservation professionals have sought to maintain or restore connectivity to ensure gene flow among isolated populations and promote recolonization of vacant patches (Hanski 1998). Given the rapid emergence of connectivity enhancement as a climate-change adaptation strategy, we considered whether connectivity should be emphasized in conservation strategies as global or regional temperatures increase and what principles for connectivity enhancement could be applied to maximize the usefulness of the strategy. The best historical analogue for the ongoing rise in global temperatures occurred 55 million years ago at the Paleocene and Eocene boundary, when the average global temperature rose 5–6 ◦C in 10,000–20,000 years (Wing et al. 2005). At that time, species’ ranges shifted and subtropical cypress swamps, complete with alligators, existed on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic (Estes & Hutchison 1980). A similar rise in temperature has been projected within the next 100–200 years (IPCC 2007), two orders of magnitude faster than previous warming events. Movements of some species, however, are now restricted by human-caused fragmentation and other barriers. The primary rationale for increasing connectivity is that if the effects of land-cover fragmentation can be mitigated, this should enhance the ability of species to move into new regions as climate changes (Fig. 1), thereby decreasing the probability of extirpation or extinction. Here, increasing connectivity refers to management actions that facilitate dispersal of species among natural areas, for example, through the establishment of landscape corridors or stepping-stone reserves or through actions that increase matrix permeability.

This was undertaken using a combined ecological and genetic approach with connectivity estimated by gene flow. Vegetation within the corridor was found to be comparable in physical structure and species composition to that within the connected patches and the two target species (Melomys cervinipes and Uromys caudimaculatus) were shown to occur along the corridor but not within the surrounding matrix. These factors indicated that the corridor was suitable for use as a model system. The population structure (weights of individuals, sex ratios and the percentage of juveniles) of both species were also similar within the corridor and the connected patches suggesting that the corridor provided the resources necessary to sustain breeding populations along its length. Despite this, populations in patches linked by the corridor were found to show the same significant levels of genetic differentiation as those in isolated habitats. M. cervinipes, but not U. caudimaculatus, also showed population differentiation within the continuous habitat. Although based on only one corridor system, these results clearly demonstrate that connectivity between connected populations will not always be achieved by the construction or retention of a corridor and that connectivity cannot be inferred solely from the presence of individuals, or breeding populations, within the corridor.","10.1007/s10980-005-5203-6","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-005-5203-6","Landscape Ecology","3","10.1007/s10980-005-5203-6","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-005-5203-6"

Additionally, the edge effects appear to be constrained by matrix type, suggesting that landscape composition has an influence on biomass stocks. The lack of empirical evidence of pervasive edge-related biomass losses across tropical forests highlights the necessity for a general framework linking landscape structure with aboveground biomass. Here, we propose a conceptual model in which landscape composition and configuration mediate the magnitude of edge effects and seed-flux among forest patches, which ultimately has an influence on biomass. Our model hypothesizes that a rapid reduction of biomass can occur below a threshold of forest cover loss. Just below this threshold, we predict that changes in landscape configuration can strongly influence the patch's isolation, thus enhancing biomass loss. Moreover, we expect a synergism between landscape composition and patch attributes, where matrix type mediates the effects of edges on species decline, particularly for shade-tolerant species. To test our conceptual framework, we propose a sampling protocol where the effects of edges, forest amount, forest isolation, fragment size, and matrix type on biomass stocks can be assessed both collectively and individually. The proposed model unifies the combined effects of landscape and patch structure on biomass into a single framework, providing a new set of main drivers of biomass loss in human-modified landscapes. We argue that carbon trading agendas (e.g., REDD+) and carbon-conservation initiatives must go beyond the effects of forest loss and edges on biomass, considering the whole set of effects on biomass related to changes in landscape composition and configuration.","10.1111/gcb.13970","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13970","Global Change Biology","3","10.1111/gcb.13970","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13970"

While several graph-related indices have been used for this purpose, there is still need to evaluate landscape connectivity from different perspectives. Based on classic network indices, we developed five novel landscape connectivity indices that incorporated attributes related to the quality of the patches, the connections among them, the dispersal probabilities and the overall habitat availability. To evaluate their performance, we applied them on three ecological networks developed for three species with different traits, at different scales, and compared them with widely used landscape connectivity indices. The developed indices identified, in all the three networks, critical patches that were well-connected with others, and also aggregated valuable features which could affect network quality. Some critical patches and specific network connectivity properties could be overlooked if not considering the additional dimensions of information that these advanced indices incorporate. We showed that the developed indices exhibited flexibility and wide applicability, offering novel insights on the evaluation of node contribution to the overall network connectivity. By integrating spatial patterns and processes, the solutions provided by the new indices could serve as an effective tool towards supporting landscape conservation planning.","10.1007/s10980-021-01319-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-021-01319-2","Landscape Ecology","3","10.1007/s10980-021-01319-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-021-01319-2"

Omnidirectional circuit theory algorithms model the flow of electric current across a resistance grid from all directions, making them particularly useful for modeling connectivity of multiple or widespread species, or when source and destination sites are not specified, such as in the case of continuously distributed species. We compared three published omnidirectional connectivity methods—the point-based method, the wall-to-wall method, and the Omniscape method. We compared the three omnidirectional connectivity methods using ten simulated resistance grids, representing commonly encountered landscape features. We then used three Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) snow-track datasets from Ontario, Canada to validate the ability of each method to detect landscape use. Current density maps generated by all three methods were highly correlated for most simulated landscapes, with the exception of uniform resistance grids. In uniform grids, without landscape features to guide current, each method revealed unique node-placement biases. All three methods produced similar connectivity maps for lynx, showing higher current at lynx presence locations compared to absence locations. The main differences between methods were not in their output, but in their implementation and use of computational resources. Our findings suggest that all three currently published omnidirectional connectivity models produce similar current density maps and can accurately map landscape connectivity. We provide guidelines for selecting a method based on factors such as computational resources, study area, and project goals.","10.1007/s10980-021-01254-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-021-01254-2","Landscape Ecology","5","10.1007/s10980-021-01254-2","https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-021-01254-2"

We reviewed the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on species' abilities to track changing climates and existing plans to facilitate species dispersal in response to climate change through regions of intensive land uses, drawing on examples from North America and elsewhere. We identified an emerging analytical framework that accounts for variation in species' dispersal capacities relative to both the pace of climate change and habitat availability. Habitat loss and fragmentation hinder climate change tracking, particularly for specialists, by impeding both propagule dispersal and population growth. This framework can be used to identify prospective modern-era climatic refugia, where the pace of climate change has been slower than surrounding areas, that are defined relative to individual species' needs. The framework also underscores the importance of identifying and managing dispersal pathways or corridors through semi-continental land use barriers that can benefit many species simultaneously. These emerging strategies to facilitate range shifts must account for uncertainties around population adaptation to local environmental conditions. Accounting for uncertainties in climate change and dispersal capabilities among species and expanding biological monitoring programs within an adaptive management paradigm are vital strategies that will improve species' capacities to track rapidly shifting climatic conditions across landscapes dominated by intensive human land use.","10.1111/cobi.12556","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12556","Conservation Biology","4","10.1111/cobi.12556","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12556"

In this study, we investigated whether there are general determinants of community response to disturbance across different community types, locations, and disturbance events. We compiled 14 case studies of community response to disturbance from four continents, twelve aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem types, and eight different types of disturbance. We used community compositional differences and species richness to indicate community response. We used mixed-effects modeling to test the relationship between each of these response metrics and four potential explanatory factors: regional species pool size, isolation, number of generations passed, and relative disturbance intensity. We found that compositional similarity was higher between pre- and post-disturbance communities when the disturbed community was connected to adjacent undisturbed habitat. The number of generations that had passed since the disturbance event was a significant, but weak, predictor of community compositional change; two communities were responsible for the observed relationship. We found no significant relationships between the factors we tested and changes in species richness. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to search for general drivers of community resilience from a diverse set of case studies. The strength of the relationship between compositional change and isolation suggests that it may be informative in resilience research and biodiversity management.","10.1111/ecog.02383","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02383","Ecography","17","10.1111/ecog.02383","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02383"

Their implementation is limited by patterns of land ownership and complicated by differences in the jurisdictional and regulatory authorities under which lands are managed. Terrestrial corridor conservation requires coordination across jurisdictions and sectors subject to site-specific overlapping sources of legal authority. Mapping spatial patterns of legal authority concurrent with habitat condition can illustrate opportunities to build or leverage capacity for connectivity conservation. Streamside areas provide pragmatic opportunities to leverage existing policy mechanisms for riverine and terrestrial habitat connectivity across boundaries. Conservation planners and practitioners can make use of these opportunities by harmonizing actions for multiple conservation outcomes. We formulated an integrative, data-driven method for mapping multiple sources of legal authority weighted by capacity for coordinating terrestrial habitat conservation along streams. We generated a map of capacity to coordinate streamside corridor protections across a wildlife habitat gap to demonstrate this approach. We combined values representing coordination capacity and naturalness to generate an integrated legal-ecological resistance map for connectivity modeling. We then computed least-cost corridors across the integrated map, masking the terrestrial landscape to focus on streamside areas. Streamside least-cost corridors in the integrated, local-scale model diverged (∼25 km) from national-scale least-cost corridors based on naturalness. Spatial categories comparing legal- and naturalness-based resistance values by stream reach highlighted potential locations for building or leveraging existing capacity through spatial coordination of policy mechanisms or restoration actions. Agencies or nongovernmental organizations intending to restore or maintain habitat connectivity across fragmented landscapes can use this approach to inform spatial prioritization and build coordination capacity.

Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species’ range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. Synthesis This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary.

A systematic review","Environmental Evidence","Environmental Evidence","7","5","Background : The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes. Methods : A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis. Results : Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had “control-impact” design, only two studies used “before-after-control-impact” design, and one study used “before-after” design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads. Conclusions : A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.","10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3","https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3","Environmental Evidence","18","10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3","https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3"

We found that small, isolated patches are inordinately important for biodiversity conservation. Our results provide a powerful argument for redressing the neglect of small, isolated habitat patches, for urgently prioritizing their restoration, and for avoiding simplistic application of island biogeography theory in conservation decisions.","10.1073/pnas.1813051115","https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1813051115","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","11","10.1073/pnas.1813051115","https://pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1813051115"

However, like the habitat patches, opportunities for movement between patches can also exist intermittently in dynamic landscapes, creating transient connectivity windows – which we define as a period of time during which matrix conditions increase the probability of one or more individuals moving successfully between habitat patches. Far less is known about the implications of dynamic changes in connectivity per se, and, to our knowledge, there are no connectivity metrics or metapopulation models that explicitly consider intermittent changes to connectivity between habitat patches. Consequently, in this paper, we examined the peer-reviewed, published literature up to November 2013 to better understand the consequences of variability in connectivity and to highlight knowledge gaps on this topic. First, we describe how connectivity per se can vary along a temporal gradient, offering examples of ecological systems that fall along this gradient. Second, we examine how temporal variability in connectivity is important for metapopulation dynamics, particularly given likely alterations to disturbance regimes as a result of global change. We conclude our review by briefly discussing key avenues for future connectivity-related research, all of which hinge on the need to perceive connectivity as a transient feature.","10.1186/2051-3933-2-1","https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2051-3933-2-1","Movement Ecology","2","10.1186/2051-3933-2-1","https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2051-3933-2-1"

The key challenge will be to provide food for all with fewer farmers in rural areas and limited options for expanding cultivated fields in urban areas, with sustainable soil management being a fundamental criterion for achieving sustainability goals. Understanding how nature works in a fast changing world and fostering nature-based agriculture (such as low-input farming) are crucial for sustaining food systems in the face of worsening urban heat island (UHI) effects and other climatic variables. The best fit for the context is transformative agroecology, which connects ecological networks, sustainable farming approaches, and social movements through change-oriented research and action. Even though agroecology has been practiced for over a century, its potential to address the socioeconomic impact of the food system remained largely unexplored until recently. Agroecological approaches, which involve effective interactions between researchers, policy makers, farmers, and consumers, can improve social cohesion and socioeconomic synergies while reducing the use of various agricultural inputs. This review presents a timeline of agroecology transformation from the past to the present and discusses the possibilities, prospects, and challenges of agroecological urbanism toward a resilient urban future.</jats:p>","10.3390/su14020590","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2621383824?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=TgSrqL4QqN4JPjwhhuY4cIFCkMM%3D","Sustainability","6","10.3390/su14020590","https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2621383824?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=TgSrqL4QqN4JPjwhhuY4cIFCkMM%3D"

A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons. Important measures for the prevention of such disappearances include: 1. the consolidation of open space set-asides, and 2. the provision of corridors linking habitat patches. Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, particularly where they facilitate the movement of large predators. Where both landscape linkages and juxtaposition of open space elements are impractical, mitigation banking is suggested. Here, the developer, instead of setting aside tiny parcels that will deteriorate rapidly, deposits money into an account for future open space acquisition.","10.1007/978-0-387-73412-5_46","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890151305&doi=10.1007%2f978-0-387-73412-5_46&partnerID=40&md5=bf02087c4a1ed0b9b9d42d6cdcff3cd1","American Planning Association.

To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the \\""Ecological corridor construction\\"" project and the \\""Grain for Green\\"" project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
