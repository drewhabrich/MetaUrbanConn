The object was to provide a comprehensive method to study urban forest structure and its function in environmental improvement. The results showed that there were 5 major landscape elements, i.e., building and hard pavement surface, water, road, urban forest, and general green land in the area. The landscape matrix was building and pavement surface, occupied 73.13 % of total land. Road was the typical corridor element in the city and occupied 6.89%. Green land occupied 11.44 %, in which, urban forest patch occupied 9.18 %. There were 408 urban forest patches, with an area of 161.16 hm2. The average area of the patch was 0.396 hm2, and the maximum area was 12 hm2, 48 % of urban forest patch was identified as small scale patches with &lt; 500 m2 of area, and only 8.6 % of them was larger than 1 hm2. The number of general green land patch was 255, with an area of 39.74 hm2, which accounted for 2.26 % of land area, and its average and maximum area was 0.1558 hm2 and 3.86 hm2, respectively. There were 147 water patches, with an area of 149.93 hm2, and occupied 8.54 % of land, and the average and maximum area of the patch was 1.02 hm2 and 16 hm2, respectively. In the study area, both of the Shannon-Weiner landscape diversity index and evenness were low, only 0.928 and 0.576, respectively. In addition, the dominance of urban forest patch and general green land was 0.39, showing that the two landscape elements had a certain influence on the environment of the study area. The concept of interior habitat for forest was introduced in this paper, which was employed to make a scale class system of urban forest patch. The threshold area with interior habitat for urban forest patch was 9800m2, and there was 31.69hm2 of interior habitat of urban forest in total, which occupied 19.7 % of the total area of urban forest patch. This situation was not favorable for providing more habitats to support species diversity. It's suggested that the concept of interior habitat could be employed to identify urban forest patch, and a scale system of small scale patch of urban forest-middle patch-large patch-extra large patch was build in the paper. Based on this system, the ratio of different scales of urban forest patch in the study area should be 2:2:2:3. The authors also suggested that larger pieces (1.5-3.0 hm2) of urban forest patch should be built, and more urban forests should be established in the northeastern part of the city in the future.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1642505391&partnerID=40&md5=c2936f29af36f80f305e7edb1f3e4c7f,Jour,4,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1642505391&partnerID=40&md5=c2936f29af36f80f305e7edb1f3e4c7f

Since the 1970s there has been a major change in land-use associated with both innovative town design and the decline of manufacturing and chemical industries in the boroughs. Also, co-ordinated programmes have directly addressed air and water pollution. The breeding birds of the two boroughs were surveyed in 1978-84 and 2004-06 as part of the bird atlases of Cheshire and Wirral, based on tetrads (2 × 2 km squares). We divided the breeding species into eight guilds based on broad ecological characteristics of habitat or food, omitting the generalists and colonial species, and compared the change between our two atlases in the number of occupied tetrads in Halton and Warrington and in the rest of the county. Four of our eight guilds have fared significantly better within our study area: waterbirds (24 species), those feeding on invertebrates (16 species), woodland specialists (21 species) and the two species that decorate their nests with lichens. The remaining four guilds showed no difference between Halton and Warrington and the rest of Cheshire and Wirral: raptors (5 species) have increased throughout, while breeding waders (7 species), farmland seedeaters (7 species) and aerial insectivores (5 species) have declined throughout. We interpret these results in relation to improved quality of water and air and changing patterns of land-use in the urban greenspace, especially an increase in woodland cover and connectivity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s11252-010-0132-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957812091&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-010-0132-9&partnerID=40&md5=2ac2e894f1c2e28031e7ffb71353c702,Urban Ecosystems,3,10.1007/s11252-010-0132-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957812091&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-010-0132-9&partnerID=40&md5=2ac2e894f1c2e28031e7ffb71353c702

Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-moths-an insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal links-at both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200 m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measures-such as creating and improving urban green infrastructure-to mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.",10.1111/gcb.14151,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GCBio..24.3837M/abstract; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14151; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29791767; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29791767/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791767,Global Change Biology,3,10.1111/gcb.14151,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GCBio..24.3837M/abstract; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14151; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29791767; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29791767/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791767

The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001–2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas.

However, few studies have explored the impact of different road grades on ecological network connectivity, especially at multiple levels and at different dispersal distances. Here, we propose an analytical framework based on the integrated graph theory and the circuit theory method, in order to model the ecological network of virtual species, to evaluate connectivity at the landscape, patch, and corridor levels, and to identify the key patches and key corridors that contribute the most to the maintenance of connectivity. The empirical analysis in this study was performed on six scenarios, which were designed by successively integrating different road grades into the landscape. On this basis, the impact of different road grades on the connectivity, key patches, and key corridors in Wuhan, China, were explored. The results showed that: (1) High-grade roads have a significant impact on landscape-patch-corridor connectivity, while medium-grade roads have a similar degree of impact on patch-level connectivity as high-grade roads do. (2) Species with long dispersal ability (25 km) are susceptible to roads at the landscape and corridor levels; species with low and medium dispersal abilities (10, 15 and 20 km) are vulnerable to roads at the patch levels. (3) The importance of key patches and the resistance of key corridors are signifi-cantly increased by the influence of roads, while their spatial distribution changes slightly.

The absence of coyotes may lead to higher levels of predation by a process of mesopredator release.

A crucial issue for landscape managers is how to reconcile conservation measures that benefit all species and the maintenance of human activities. This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without significantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would benefit a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species profiles defined by their affinity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species profiles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species profiles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types - either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species profiles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species profiles presenting different ecological requirements. This coupling approach thus provided guidance to propose some landscape management actions that benefit the majority of species while preserving land uses.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.002,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01844636; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618305760; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193382400,Landscape and Urban Planning,3,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.07.002,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01844636; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618305760; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193382400

Forest areas are often regarded as a spatial reserve for present and future urbanisation needs, while at the same time they often represent the last remnant of natural environment. In the present research we analysed (1) the change in forest cover in the area of suburban forests of Ljubljana between 1975 and 2012, (2) the connectivity and conservation buffers as one of the foundations for the assessment of biodiversity functions. Between 1975 and 2012, all the forests with important cores were subject to clearings for settlement- and agricultural purposes, but clearing usually did not extend beyond forest edges. The real fragmentation occurred during the construction of the highway beltline. In the area of Ljubljana, connectivity changes and connectivity loss in two different time periods are presented by a spatial model based on the Graph Theory which can also be used in spatial planning. Due to the high percentage of forest cover and the favourable distribution of forest patches and cores around the city of Ljubljana, no connection is currently in danger; the weakest link is stretching from the centre of Ljubljana towards the southeast. In the process of evaluating the biodiversity of urban forests, it will be necessary to add connectivity among forest cores as an important index while evaluating the favourable conditions of different habitat types.

Whether and how much associations between species, i.e. the degree of correlation in their spatial co-occurrence, are also changing is much less documented and mostly limited to local studies of ecological networks.

We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of β-diversity and the proportion of habitat generalists. The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements.Results We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in β-diversity and in the proportion of generalists in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower β-diversity and a higher proportion of generalists, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes.Main Conclusions Although species association contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2020.11.13.380956,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/10/2020.11.13.380956.abstract,Biorxiv,8,10.1101/2020.11.13.380956,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/10/2020.11.13.380956.abstract

A prominent framework is provided by ecological network studies, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas and patches (nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (edges). Ecological networks are key for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create and strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework based on network modelling for the study and modelling of ecological networks. We use network properties and centrality measures (degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality) and take into account the intensity of the dispersal capacity by introducing the corresponding weighted centrality measures. We simulate the dynamics of ecological networks by monitoring the residual dispersal capacity and the number of connected components from three perspectives: random attacks, deterministic attacks according to decreasing betweenness centrality and influence of master plans. We demonstrate that spatial network analysis is useful to monitor the performance of ecological networks and support decision-making, management, and planning. The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the pen-urban and urban areas of the town of Nuoro (Italy). Patches (nodes) have been selected among the ecosystems with target vegetal species Holm oak and cultivated and wild Olive while the connecting corridors (links) enable for seed dispersal.

Ecological studies of urban wetlands have typically focused on large metropolitan areas, but non-traditional urbanizing areas such as the towns of the Great Plains of North America are projected to experience land-use and climate changes that will alter connectivity among the freshwater wetlands along a continental-scale migratory wildlife corridor. We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050. These 126 wetlands can be prioritized for urban ecological studies or management because they are highly likely to be affected regardless of model or scenario. Lastly, our study highlights the utility of considering a range of developmental futures when planning urban wetland management in non-traditional urbanizing areas.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.02.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061973669&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2019.02.007&partnerID=40&md5=660e6f3a9926e69502923e6fa13d1352,Landscape and Urban Planning,2,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.02.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061973669&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2019.02.007&partnerID=40&md5=660e6f3a9926e69502923e6fa13d1352

Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations.

Conservation efforts based on natural reserves may not be able to maintain certain ecological processes that extend beyond the reserves. There is an urgent need to conserve or restore critical habitats outside of protected areas to maintain the functional connectivity of habitat networks. In this study, we developed a connectivity modelling approach associated with varying conservation scenarios to establish habitat conservation priorities in a rapidly urbanizing area of Shenzhen, China. We incorporated unprotected habitat patches into the reserve network via four scenarios and prioritized the contributions of these patches to habitat connectivity. We also investigated the responses of species with different dispersal abilities to habitat changes under each conservation scenario. The results showed that the spatial pattern of unprotected habitats played an important role in enhancing the connectivity of the entire network within the study area. The habitat patches around protected areas could create greater connectivity gains and should be prioritized for conservation. The key patches that substantially enhance connectivity were identified as special conservation concerns. The connectivity benefits from different scenarios were closely linked with species dispersal abilities. This study promotes the understanding of the importance of habitats outside of protected areas in urbanizing landscapes and provides the species-specific and spatially explicit conservation schemes for making informed decisions in urban planning and management.

The ecological sources distributed in the north were less, and the spatial distribution was scattered on the whole. The strong global positive correlation and local spatial aggregation characteristics of ecological resistance surface were evaluated according to spatial autocorrelation.

Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities.

The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species.

The impacts of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity are understudied in urban forest patches, especially in the tropics and little is known on the conservation value of the patches for maintaining mammalian biodiversity. In this study, camera trapping was used to determine the species composition and species richness of medium- and large-sized mammals in three urban forest patches and a contiguous forest in Peninsular Malaysia. We identified the key vegetation attributes that predicted mammal species richness and occurrence of herbivores and omnivores in urban forest patches. A total number of 19 mammal species from 120 sampling points were recorded. Contiguous forest had the highest number of species compared to the urban forest patches. Sunda Pangolin and Asian Tapir were the only conservation priority species recorded in the urban forest patches and contiguous forest, respectively. Top predators such as Malayan Tiger and Melanistic Leopard were completely absent from the forest patches as well as the contiguous forest. This was reflected by the abundance of wild boars. We found that mammal species richness increased with the number of trees with DBH less than 5 cm, trees with DBH more than 50 cm, and dead standing trees. In the future, the remaining mammal species in the urban forest patches are expected to be locally extinct as connecting the urban forest patches may be infeasible due to land scarcity.

Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions.

Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions.

To investigate how fragmentation of tropical forest affects population connectivity in a forest specialist bird species, we optimized resistance surfaces without a priori specification, using least-cost (LCP) or resistance (IBR) distances. We implemented a two-step procedure in order (i) to objectively define the landscape thematic resolution (level of detail in classification scheme to describe landscape variables) and spatial extent (area within the landscape boundaries) and then (ii) to test the relative role of several landscape features (elevation, roads, land cover) in genetic differentiation in the Plumbeous Warbler (Setophaga plumbea). We detected a small-scale reduction of gene flow mainly driven by land cover, with a negative impact of the nonforest matrix on landscape functional connectivity. However, matrix components did not equally constrain gene flow, as their conductivity increased with increasing structural similarity with forest habitat: urban areas and meadows had the highest resistance values whereas agricultural areas had intermediate resistance values. Our results revealed a higher performance of IBR compared to LCP in explaining gene flow, reflecting suboptimal movements across this human-modified landscape, challenging the common use of LCP to design habitat corridors and advocating for a broader use of circuit theory modelling.

The expansion of urban areas promotes drastic ecological changes, especially through fragmentation of natural areas. Natural grassland remnants surrounded by an urban matrix are more likely to undergo disturbance events. Since grassland ecosystems are closely related to disturbances such as fire and grazing, grassland plant communities, pollinators, and their interaction networks may be especially sensitive to urban expansion, because it promotes habitat fragmentation and modifies disturbance regimes. This work evaluated the effect of the level of urbanization and recent history of fire disturbance on grassland plants communities and plant-floral visitor mutualistic networks. We sampled plant communities and floral visitors in 12 grassland sites with different levels of urbanization and time since the last fire event. Sites with higher levels of urbanization showed higher values for plant species richness, floral visitor richness, and network asymmetry. All sampled networks were significantly nested (with one exception), asymmetric, and specialized. In addition, all networks presented more modules than expected by chance. The frequency of fire disturbance events increased with the level of urbanization. Since grassland ecosystems depend on disturbances to maintain their structure and diversity, we inferred that the history of fire disturbance was the mechanism behind the relationship between urbanization and our biological descriptors. Our findings highlight the importance of small and isolated grassland remnants as conservation assets within urban areas, and that the disturbance events that such sites are submitted to may in fact be what maintains their diversity on multiple levels.",10.3390/d12040141,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/12/4/141/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/12/4/141,Diversity-Basel,7,10.3390/d12040141,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/12/4/141/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/12/4/141

We then examined the resistance effect of different land use types.ResultsWith the exception of mean elevation, we found that all parameters showed a significant relationship with genetic distance, indicating that unevenness in elevation provides functional resistance to gene flow. Although we found no evidence of landscape barriers (isolation‐by‐barrier), there was an indication of landscape resistance (isolation‐by‐resistance). Urban area and farmland are suggested to be the strong factors contributing to the resistance to gene flow, even though isolation‐by‐distance was also detected. When we examined gene flow for pairs of males and pairs of females, both isolation‐by‐distance and isolation‐by‐resistance were stronger in order of female pairs, male pairs, all individual pairs.ConclusionsWe conclude that landscape resistance was detectable with a high contrast in landscape heterogeneity and they are more influential on females than males.OPEN PRACTICESThis article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally‐shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators. Aims. The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban-forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban-forest gradient. Methods. Using a total of 683 independent field-and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls. Key results. Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76% of the forest landscape to 21% of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban-forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation. Conclusions. Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient. Implications. High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators.",10.1071/WR13087,NA,Wildlife Research,4,10.1071/WR13087,NA

Here, we use a population and landscape genetic analysis of SNP data from the CFR endemic plant Leucadendron salignum or “common sunshine conebush” as a model to address the evolutionary and environmental factors shaping the vast CFR diversity. We found that high population structure, along with relatively deeper and older genealogies, is characteristic of the southwestern CFR, whereas low population structure and more recent lineage coalescence depict the eastern CFR. Population network analyses show genetic connectivity is facilitated in areas of lower elevation and higher seasonal precipitation. These population genetic signatures corroborate CFR species‐level patterns consistent with high Pleistocene biome stability and landscape heterogeneity in the southwest, but with coincident instability in the east.

We found a higher resilience to habitat fragmentation in edge‐tolerant and forest‐canopy species as compared to forest‐dependent understorey insectivores. The latter exhibited levels of genetic diversity up to three times lower in Singapore than in populations from contiguous forest elsewhere. Using dense genomic and geographic sampling, we identified individual barriers such as reservoirs that effectively minimize gene flow in sensitive understorey birds, revealing that terrestrial forest species may exhibit levels of sensitivity to fragmentation far greater than previously expected. This study provides a blueprint for conservation genomics at small scales with a view to identifying preferred locations for habitat corridors, flagging candidate populations for restocking with translocated individuals and improving the design of future reserves.",10/gjft6z,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2406502017?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ubI33jeBrBOMDCJuiJi9YIZ%2FI4E%3D,Evolutionary Applications,10,10/gjft6z,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2406502017?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ubI33jeBrBOMDCJuiJi9YIZ%2FI4E%3D

We investigated the effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and gene flow for two sympatric amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), across a large (>35,000 km2) landscape in Maine, USA, containing numerous natural and anthropogenic gradients. Isolation‐by‐distance (IBD) patterns differed between the species. Spotted salamanders showed a linear and relatively high variance relationship between genetic and geographic distances (r = .057, p < .001), whereas wood frogs exhibited a strongly nonlinear and lower variance relationship (r = 0.429, p < .001). Scale dependence analysis of IBD found gene flow has its most predictable influence (strongest IBD correlations) at distances up to 9 km for spotted salamanders and up to 6 km for wood frogs. Estimated effective migration surfaces revealed contrasting patterns of high and low genetic diversity and gene flow between the two species. Population isolation, quantified as the mean IBD residuals for each population, was associated with local urbanization and less genetic diversity in both species. The influence of geographic proximity and urbanization on population connectivity was further supported by distance‐based redundancy analysis and multiple matrix regression with randomization. Resistance surface modeling found interpopulation connectivity to be influenced by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs. Our results highlight the influence of anthropogenic landscape features within the context of natural features and broad spatial genetic patterns, in turn supporting the premise that while urbanization significantly restricts interpopulation connectivity for wood frogs and spotted salamanders, specific landscape elements have unique effects on these two sympatric species.",10/grsk6p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2310559408?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gxPyrkG%2BuuedsOmuyTR57034jHk%3D,Ecology and Evolution,3,10/grsk6p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2310559408?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gxPyrkG%2BuuedsOmuyTR57034jHk%3D

One of these activities in the area is the construction of road infrastructures. However, their construction as well as in urban areas in those extra-urban, has led to significantly increase the impact of vehicle traffic on wild fauna and especially that of small vertebrate, with this apparent extra-urban areas, in agricultural and rural spaces. The impact becomes even greater in the absence of ecological networks, which will provide greater return flow antigenic sites on time animal populations, thus significantly limiting their dynamics. The possibility of intra and inter-specific exchange between animal populations can be achieved through ecological corridors, which remain single strategy for solving animal populations in terms of environmental fragmentation in particular from road infrastructures. The impact becomes even bigger in animal populations in case of presence of leaks forest ecosystems near roads, in eco-tonal generations. Expansion and improvement of the road network in Albania has grown significantly in the extent of the impact on small vertebrate fauna as in urban and extraurban areas. The study was conducted at three different points in the road network in urban area and outside urban areas.

Local habitat characteristics of a patch (lh), the cost of traversing the landscape matrix between patches (weighted connectivity [wc]), and the position of the patch in the habitat network topology (nt) all influence occurrence‐state. Existing models are data demanding or consider only local habitat characteristics. We address these shortcomings and present a network‐based modeling approach, which aims to predict species occurrence‐state in habitat patches using readily available presence‐only records.For the tree frog Hyla arborea in the Swiss Plateau, we delineated habitat network nodes from an ensemble habitat suitability model and used different cost surfaces to generate the edges of three networks: one limited only by dispersal distance (Uniform), another incorporating traffic, and a third based on inverse habitat suitability. For each network, we calculated explanatory variables representing the three categories (lh, wc, and nt). The response variable, occurrence‐state, was parametrized by a sampling intensity procedure assessing observations of comparable species over a threshold of patch visits. The explanatory variables from the three networks and an additional non‐topological model were related to the response variable with boosted regression trees.The habitat network models had a similar fit; they all outperformed the non‐topological model. Habitat suitability index (lh) was the most important predictor in all networks, followed by third‐order neighborhood (nt). Patch size (lh) was unimportant in all three networks.We found that topological variables of habitat networks are relevant for the prediction of species occurrence‐state, a step‐forward from models considering only local habitat characteristics. For any habitat patch, occurrence‐state is most prominently influenced by its habitat suitability and then by the number of patches in a wide neighborhood. Our approach is generic and can be applied to multiple species in different habitats.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312222226?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=zj2uUMrUN9IcwAaNGolUU%2F1EEYk%3D,Ecology and Evolution,4,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312222226?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=zj2uUMrUN9IcwAaNGolUU%2F1EEYk%3D

Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.",10/frp8h4,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1309934860?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Dzo2hwFQAUx9KH8JY1cCzo4%2B8yw%3D,Plos One,5,10/frp8h4,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1309934860?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Dzo2hwFQAUx9KH8JY1cCzo4%2B8yw%3D

Investigating anthropogenic impacts on the persistence of biodiversity is key to management decision-making. We investigated the influence of protected areas (PAs), agriculture and urbanisation on the occupancy of mammal communities in an anthropogenic matrix containing indigenous forest fragments of the Coastal Belt of southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We integrated camera-trap mammal data, land-use and human population density within occupancy models, and compared occupancy of individual species across the land-use mosaic. We modelled occupancy of seven mammal species with sufficient na < ve occupancy (> 0.20, range 0.25-0.87). The occupancy of Philantomba monticola was positively influenced by human population size and was higher within urban areas compared with PAs. Although human population size positively affected Hystrix africaeaustralis occupancy, it along with Atilax paludinosus had a lower occupancy within urban areas. Tragelaphus scriptus and Potamochoerus larvatus overall had higher and Sylvicapra grimmia had lower occupancies within PAs. Species were variable in their response to the anthropogenic changes in the landscape. For example, occupancy of P. monticola was low within PAs but high in areas where change in land ownership and loss of habitat are threats. For other species, it appeared that the density of infrastructure of the urban landscape, rather than human population density, affected them negatively. However, seasonal differences within different management regimes also provided context-specific influences on occupancy and detectability.

The metropolitan area of Istanbul, with its rapid urbanization rate, has faced intense pressure regarding the sustainability of urban habitats. In this context, landscapes comprising patches affected by various disturbances and undergoing temporal changes must be analyzed, in order to assess city-related disturbances. In this study, the main objective was to understand how urbanization changed the function of the spatial distribution of the urban mosaic and, more specifically, its relationship with the size, shape, and connection among land-use classes. For this purpose, we took Besiktas, a district of Istanbul, as the study area. We evaluated the landscape pattern of the urban environment in two stages. First, we used medium-resolution satellite imagery to reveal the general interactions in the urbanization process. Landscape- and class-level landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape connectivity, and the distances between classes (green areas and artificial surfaces), patterns, and processes, using five satellite images representing a time span of 51 years (1963, 1984, 1997, 2005, and 2014). The general landscape structure was examined by looking at the temporal–spatial processes of artificial surface and green areas obtained from these medium-resolution satellite images. The trends in selected landscape-level metrics were specified and discussed through the use of a moving window analysis. We then used Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery (2015) to analyze the landscape structure in more detail. This high-resolution base image allows us to recognize the possibility of classifying basic cultural landscape classes. The findings regarding the spatial arrangement of each class in the areas allocated to 14 cultural landscape classes were interpreted by associating them with the landscape functions. Finally, particulate matter (PM10) concentration data were collected and evaluated as an ecological indicator, in order to reveal the relationships between landscape structure and landscape function. In short, we first evaluated the whole landscape structure using medium-resolution data, followed by the classification of cultural landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a time-effective—and, therefore, essential—auxiliary method for landscape evaluation. This two-stage evaluation method enables inferences to be made that can shed light on the landscape functions in an urban environment based on the landscape structure.",10/grsk4p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2748568670?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qYuRMhmH5a2FR5EGavukqMRbnr8%3D,Sustainability,6,10/grsk4p,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2748568670?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qYuRMhmH5a2FR5EGavukqMRbnr8%3D

To evaluate the potential of very high-resolution imagery (WorldView-2, 30-cm resolution) to fill this gap, we sought to a) map contrasting urban vegetation cover types (grass, shrubs and woody vegetation) at the meter scale and with high accuracy, b) quantify the structural and functional connectivity of urban vegetation, and c) estimate the status of productive vegetation. We focused our analysis on land use and cover in the city of Xalapa in Veracruz, Mexico, and employed multiscale satellite imagery to estimate vegetation cover, connectivity, and health. We identified 38,579 patches of woody vegetation, of which 93 % corresponded to isolated trees contributing to 27 % of vegetation connectivity. Without woody vegetation, the connectivity index decrease up to 97 %; removing grass or shrubs would reduce connectivity by 38 % or 32 %, respectively. We identified 10 patches disproportionately important to connectivity, of which seven had some type of legal protection. Across vegetation types, 38 % of the vegetated area was unhealthy.

In this study, we assessed the influence of landscape features on population genetic structure and gene flow of a semiaquatic species, the muskrat. A total of 97 muskrats were sampled from three watersheds near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. We estimated population genetic structure using 11 microsatellite loci and identified a single genetic cluster and no genetic differences were found among the watersheds as a result of high levels of gene flow. At finer scales, we assessed the correlation between individual pairwise genetic distances and Euclidean distance as well as different models of least cost path (LCP).

The consequences thereof mainly involve losses of traditional land uses and changes in the socioecomic structures of the local population. The lack of coupling ‘urban society-countryside’ can be considered to constitute a driving force of this process. The present paper focuses upon the rural-urban network around the metropolis of Madrid (Central Spain). We developed a quantitative model to explain the socio-ecological rural-urban linkages, taking into account the influence of the metropolis in the network of neighbouring municipalities. The results show a rural landscape gradient ranging from silvo-pastoral to agricultural land uses and maintaining different interactions with the local socioeconomy. Urban-rural polarisation of the territory and accessibility to the metropolis are the main factors influencing the landscape dynamics. Territorial cohesion among municipalities and connectivity with the metropolis are factors determining the socio-ecological structure. The agricultural area presents good social cohesion, but a weak connection with the City. The silvo-pastoral landscape, on the contrary, maintains prominent links with the metropolis, but a non-significant interconnection between the small towns. The model tested constitutes a useful tool for analysing socio-ecological connectivity and for quantifying, designing and promoting territorial cohesion policies.",10/ghkfth,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2092727656?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=FOUjwwtiLFmbfA4dfkeYhu%2F%2Fohs%3D,Urban Ecosystems,8,10/ghkfth,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2092727656?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=FOUjwwtiLFmbfA4dfkeYhu%2F%2Fohs%3D

Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qSbDwCa4x79cWRIkSQZqmwYSkcg%3D,Pqdt - Global,1,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qSbDwCa4x79cWRIkSQZqmwYSkcg%3D

However, their narrowness cast doubts regarding their capacity to act as connectors for vertebrates with large home ranges, such as birds. Here we show that bird communities in drove roads crossing agrarian landscapes in the Madrid Region (Spain) are a predictable subset of species in comparison to those in wooded protected sites, and that species richness declines in them with the distance from Natura 2000 sites and with the reduction in forest cover of the area. Thus, drove roads sustain nesting bird communities that depend on the wider landscape rather than on their own characteristics, and can only play a secondary role as refuges, stepping stones or corridors funneling bird movements between protected sites.AbstractEcological connectivity among protected Natura 2000 sites is a priority for conservation in Europe due to the increasing pressure on biodiversity from human activities and climate change. Drove roads, the traditional paths used to move livestock through the territory, have been proposed as potential ecological corridors due to their large extent, continuous nature and centennial protection from ploughing and urbanization, which allows the persistence of some tree cover and natural habitats in them. Bird communities were sampled during the reproductive season along 19 drove road transects in agrarian landscapes between Natura 2000 sites, all of them around the conurbation of Madrid (Madrid Region, Spain). Bird community nestedness was assessed by NODF computation followed by significance estimation by aleatorization, and factors explaining species richness and bird abundance were analyzed through General Linear Models fitted with environmental variables measured on official vegetation maps and orthophotos. Bird communities in drove roads were significantly nested, showing high predictability in the order of species loss from better preserved sites to those under stronger environmental pressures. Accordingly, Poisson regression showed bird richness to decrease strongly with distance from the closest Natura 2000 site and to increase with forest cover at the landscape and at the drove road scales. Bird abundance increased strongly with distance from urban areas and motorways, and it was slightly higher in areas with more forest cover and in transects with less bare ground. These results, and the higher relevance detected for landscape scale variables (500 m around transects) than for those at the drove road (50 m) scale, show that (i) they can only play a secondary role as habitat for nesting birds but (ii) they may add to the Green Infrastructure strategy as facilitators or stepping stones for bird communities if the surrounding landscape is favorable for them.",10/grsk7w,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656368712?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qLIO3eaXq6bbUG4B0tqTHO4Y6Ys%3D,Birds,3,10/grsk7w,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656368712?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qLIO3eaXq6bbUG4B0tqTHO4Y6Ys%3D

However, the spatial impact of landscape patterns of patches with different IPS density (IPSD) on the thermal environment remains largely unexplored. Based on three Landsat 8 images of the Xuzhou built-up area obtained in May and the corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020, the IPSD and LST maps were inversed through a linear spectral mixture analysis and mono-window algorithm, respectively. The landscape patterns of the five IPSD levels were characterized by four landscape-level and five class-level metrics. Finally, the spatial correlation between all landscape metrics and LST were analyzed using bivariate Moran’s I. The results were as follows: (1) The findings revealed that for the landscape-level metrics, LST had significant positive spatial correlations with Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI), Shannon’s evenness index (SHEI), and patch density (PD), while showing a significant negative correlation with contagion index (CONTAG), indicating that increasing the types, even distribution degree, and density of patches, or decreasing the aggregation degree of the five IPSD levels will lead to the enhancement of the thermal environment. (2) Furthermore, the class-level metrics of each IPSD level, percentage of landscape (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), aggregation index (AI), and patch cohesion index (COHESION) showed significant correlations and LST, which signified that the spatial characteristics of patch proportion, predominance degree, shape complexity, aggregation degree, and natural connectivity degree of each IPSD level are important factors affecting UHI. In addition, the spatial correlations between LST and class-level metrics were significantly positive for IPSD levels 4 and 5 with an evidently higher Moran’s I value, indicating that landscape patterns of IPSD levels 4 and 5 were the key factors in UHI enhancement. Furthermore, the impact weights of each class-level metric of IPSD levels 4 and 5 on LST were also analyzed by applying the principal component analysis and the multivariate regression standardization coefficient. These results reveal the importance and impact mechanism of the IPSD spatial patterns on UHI evolution, which may provide a valuable reference for future urban planning and climate management. This study also suggests that regional UHI can be mitigated by reducing the area proportion, natural connectivity, and shape complexity of high-density impervious surfaces.",10/grsk9b,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756733126?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=2uOQI8RfRwEUodbcjPzgUKAfu%2B4%3D,Land,5,10/grsk9b,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756733126?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=2uOQI8RfRwEUodbcjPzgUKAfu%2B4%3D

Research on the adaptive planning policies for microthermal environments at the residential block level of cities is thus becoming of greater significance. Based on the cooling effect of planning control elements in residential block areas, the element effects characteristics of water bodies and vegetation distribution on the thermal environment of residential blocks were analyzed by using ENVI-met software. The simulation data analysis showed that the combination of water bodies and vegetation had a synergistic cooling effect. Based on these results, simulations of five effective adaptive measures were carried out step by step in planning scenarios, that is, improving the water bodies with vegetation corridors, the application of high-albedo material on streets, and increasing the number of green patches, east-west green corridors, and north-south green corridors. The results were as follows. First, although each of the five optimization strategies have a certain degree of cooling effect on the entire block, the superposition of each factor had a synergistic effect. Second, different spatial optimization strategies had different cooling ranges for each subzone. The optimization of the north-south green corridor, green patches, and water features corridors were particularly significant for microclimate cooling. The east-west green corridor has a certain influence on a certain range of downwind zones and had an auxiliary cooling effect. The high-albedo material also had a weak overall decrease function for the thermal environment. Finally, the downwind area of the urban creek network had a great impact on cooling intensity, with distance attenuation characteristics; it was also proposed that the comprehensive cooling effect of the green space network with optimized layout was greater than that of any single green space element.

We examined the effect of greenway forested corridor width, vegetation composition and structure, and adjacent land cover on the species richness and abundance of migrating songbirds during spring and fall migration in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Generally, migrating birds were more abundant in wider forest corridors during spring and fall migration. During the spring, migrants were detected more commonly in greenways with taller trees and a higher percentage of hardwood trees. In the fall, migrant richness and abundance was highest in greenways with lower canopy cover, possibly because of the increased vertical complexity of the vegetation at these sites. Forest-interior migrant richness was not correlated with corridor width in either season, but these species were more abundant in greenways bordered by less bare earth and pavement cover in the spring. No other bird groupings were correlated with adjacent land cover measures. Although migrants used greenways of all widths, forested corridors wider than 150 m should be conserved whenever possible to provide stopover habitat for forest-interior migrants. Shrub cover should be retained to maintain vegetative complexity. Habitat for the greatest diversity of migrants can be provided by constructing greenways in areas of lower development intensity and encouraging residents to retain shrubs and trees on properties bordering greenways.

Commonly-used species-specific connectivity models are difficult to generalize for a wide range of taxa. In the context of multi-functional land-use planning, there is growing interest in species-agnostic approaches, modelling connectivity as a function of human landscape modification. We propose a conceptual framework, apply it to model connectivity as current density across Alberta, Canada, and assess map sensitivity to modelling decisions. We directly compared the uncertainty related to (1) the definition of the degree of human modification, (2) the decision whether water bodies are considered barriers to movement, and (3) the scaling function used to translate degree of human modification into resistance values. Connectivity maps were most sensitive to the consideration of water as barrier to movement, followed by the choice of scaling function, whereas maps were more robust to different conceptualizations of the degree of human modification. We observed higher concordance among cells with high (standardized) current density values than among cells with low values, which supports the identification of cells contributing to larger-scale connectivity based on a cut-off value.

Monitoring the colonization of these new wetlands is critical to an adaptive management process. We conducted a turtle mark-recapture survey in a 250 ha artificially created wetland complex in a large North American city (Toronto, Ontario). We found that two of Ontario’s eight native turtle species (Snapping turtle (SN), Chelydra serpentina, and Midland Painted (MP) turtle, Chrysemys picta marginata) were abundant and both were confirmed nesting. The Blanding’s turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) was present but not well established. Species richness and turtle density were not equally distributed throughout the wetland complex. We noted SN almost exclusively populated one water body, while other areas of the wetland had a varying representation of both species. The sex ratios of both SN and MP turtles were 1:1. We tracked the movement of Snapping and Blanding’s turtles and found that most turtles explored at least two water bodies in the park, that females explored more water bodies than males, and that 95% of turtles showed fidelity to individual overwintering wetlands. We performed DNA analysis of two Blanding’s turtles found in the created wetlands and could not assign these turtles to any known profiled populations. The genetic data suggest that the turtles probably belong to a remnant local population.

This study aims at the application of ecological principles to develop an integrated urban land-use planning for Panyu case that could optimize the urban ecosystem. Panyu is classified into four functional zones: (1) ecological protection areas, which are important to maintain regional ecological process; (2) restricted construction areas, which can be changed and adjusted over time without losing the conservation potential; (3) suitable construction areas, which are set aside for future development; and (4) built-up areas. Different land-use management measures with emphases either on ecological aims or on construction are proposed. Ecological patches are connected by corridors to form an ecological network, which is spatially flexible and has the potential to integrate development and conservation and make conservation of species diversity adaptive.

Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km(2), 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of ""two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes"" was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.",10.3390/ijerph19159582,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136341301&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19159582&partnerID=40&md5=bf150be61ff21088a17e81713db0509d,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,3,10.3390/ijerph19159582,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700640062?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=gvGZJlT0B6qoayw12E%2BtIzMOdas%3D

The centipede assemblage of suburban forest fragment is characterized by a greater complexity and stability compared to the centipede assemblages of central and extraurban forest fragments, both apparently in a typical state of successional stages. The distribution pattern of the centipede diversity of the study area seems to deviate from the usual patterns found in other European cities for other arthropod assemblages as well as for the centipedes, as the greater biodiversity has been recorded in the suburban forest fragment, not in the extraurban one.

In particular, flying vertebrates are especially at risk, both directly, through an extra mortality rate due to collision with turbines and electrocution, and indirectly through habitat loss or fragmentation. In this study, we propose a modelling approach that combines species distribution models and data managed in geographic information systems to predict and quantify the effects of wind turbines and power lines on the breeding habitat of a soaring migratory bird, the black stork Ciconia nigra, in Italy. The species is recolonizing the country, where it had been driven to extinction in the Middle Age by human persecution. Today, infrastructures such as those considered in our study might in fact hamper this recolonization. Our results show a high probability of presence of the species in several areas in Italy. The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the future.

Urbanization-induced landscape fragmentation represents a considerable impediment to species' range shifts. Large-scale afforestation is often suggested to be an effective measure to mitigate the negative impacts of landscape fragmentation. However, the effectiveness of afforestation on climate-driven forest migration has rarely been evaluated in urban environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of two common afforestation strategies in promoting the migration of bird-dispersed tree species in Greater Manchester, UK: (A) planting trees in private gardens and roadsides and (B) establishing large woodlands in public lands. A modelling approach combining graph and circuit theory was used to assess the improvement in landscape connectivity after urban afforestation and to analyze how the two strategies promote the process of forest migration under climate change. Our results suggested that planting trees in gardens and streets could improve the spatial patterns of forest migration by forming stepping stones for the movement of birds across the urban matrix; establishing large woodlands in public areas could enhance the probability of forest migration between urban woodlands by providing population hubs. We found that the effectiveness of urban afforestation was strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of trees and the physical characteristics of local bird species.

Aims: To explore and quantify the movements of birds from winter to breeding season locations across the urban-rural ecotone at the boundary of a large urban area. Methods: Birds were colour-ringed at rural and urban/suburban garden ringing sites during the winter. This was followed by breeding season surveys and resighting in the surrounding areas to quantify the movements of colour-ringed birds and changes in habitat selection between seasons. Results: Blue Tits and Great Tits ringed in winter in rural areas tended to move further and selected more urbanized breeding territories the following spring than did urban/suburban garden-ringed conspecifics. This shows that the populations were connected across the urban-rural ecotone by the seasonal movements of individuals, but that net movement was from rural wintering areas to urban breeding habitat. Conclusion: The results suggest that rural populations may not be subsidized by urban wintering birds and winter supplementary feeding, but that the resources in gardens within urban areas, perhaps spring/summer feeding and nestboxes, draw birds in to breed. Combined with independent evidence for lower breeding success in urban areas, this may show the operation of source-sink dynamics.

In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous flora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical (>50%) in the spontaneous flora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment.

Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network. Methods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis. Results. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic. The characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen. Scientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined. Practical importance.

Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multilevel, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.",10.1371/journal.pone.0179570,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020737980&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0179570&partnerID=40&md5=2db692dc86312abb859afed7d7cdcd76,Plos One,4,10.1371/journal.pone.0179570,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28609466; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5469479; https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/multi-level-multi-scale-resource-selection-functions-and-resistan; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173264376; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179570&type=printable; https://core.ac.uk/display/149496096; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179570; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1279570Z/abstract; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179570; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28609466/; https://paperity.org/p/80363435/multi-level-multi-scale-resource-selection-functions-and-resistance-surfaces-for

Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds. Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield. Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK. Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover. Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.",10.1111/ddi.13239,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104424590&doi=10.1111%2fddi.13239&partnerID=40&md5=8b0215abe17427948ed1284118b1fc95,Diversity and Distributions,9,10.1111/ddi.13239,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/170114/; https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/local-contributions-to-beta-diversity-in-urban-pond-networks(5dd152db-df78-4a2f-97b1-5ac7958c40c1).html; https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/files/136093293/ddi.13239.pdf; http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13094/; https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/local-contributions-to-beta-diversity-in-urban-pond-networks-impl; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ddi.13239; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13239

In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or fields in a landscape. We took a finite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, USA. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized finite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape. This approach can provide guidance for conservation planning based on analysis of animal movement data using statistical models, thereby linking connectivity evaluations to empirical data.",10.1890/12-0687.1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734492; https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70125388; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/12-0687.1,Ecological Applications,6,10.1890/12-0687.1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734492; https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70125388; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1890/12-0687.1; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/12-0687.1

Differential ability of the shrubs and herbs in the sustenance of the butterflies was reflected in the network indices using the herbs and the shrubs, separately. In urban landscapes with restricted variety of flowering plants, an estimate of relative strength of interactions enables identification and further use of the concerned species in sustaining butterfly populations.

Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 x 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species.

A case study using amphibians,Landscape and Urban Planning,Landscape and Urban Planning,107,409,"Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency.

The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel viewpoint and method to identify, analyze and optimize the ecological network of Wuyishan City. The bidirectional least-cost distance model is applied to identify the landscape network in Wuyishan City for the year 1995 and 2005, which can incorportate digraph in ecological network modeling, overcome the limitation of failing to reflect the orientation of the species' dispersal process, and make the process of modeling more convincing by distinguishing flux orientation of ""go"" and ""return"" of two random patches. Three new metrics, i.e., network cyclicity, degree of cyclicity, and degree of connectedness, which can quantify the integrity and continuity of network and the relation between network organization and ecological process, are introduced to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and reflect the network's ability to transfer bio-flux. The results show that the ecological network of Wuyishan City in the year 1995 and 2005 have respectively a network size of 18 and 17, degree of connectedness of 1 and 0.7647, network cyclicity of 7.1378 and 8.2570, and degree of cyclicity of 0.3965 and 0.4857, which indicate that the network in Wuyishan City for the year 2005 has strong ability to transfer bio-flux, a high level of eco-process diversity, and a low level of integrity and continuity. It can be concluded that during the past 10 years, different areas of Wuyishan City have gone through landscape degradation and restoration. In the northeast, network components degraded severely and made several patches ""isolated islands"", while in the southwest, the network has been developed because of landscape restoration. In particular, the linkages among the patches of natural reserve and its neighborhood increased remarkably, which directly increased the interaction strength and the whole network cyclicity. Then, via scenario analysis, we also identify the patches and linkages that make great contributions to the entire cyclicity and connectedness, such as patches [1,2,3,4,5,6] (Nature reserve and its neighborhood), [12] (bridging the north and west part) and [19] (bridging the south and west part), and linkages among the central patches.

This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges.

As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes).A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (alpha-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low 13-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors alpha plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130563290&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115358&partnerID=40&md5=36636a9dbd6d43bb08801cb07715c6a4,Journal of Environmental Management,4,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130563290&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115358&partnerID=40&md5=36636a9dbd6d43bb08801cb07715c6a4

We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of species turnover (beta-diversity) and community generalism (community generalisation index). The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements. We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in species turnover and community generalism in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower spatial species turnover and higher community generalism, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations and may also have an impact on species interactions. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes. Although species associations contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.",10.1111/oik.08756,NA,Oikos,8,10.1101/2020.11.13.380956,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/06/10/2020.11.13.380956.abstract

Here, I provide a high spatial resolution snapshot of the green cover distribution of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, by incorporating the use of morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) as a tool to describe the spatial pattern and connectivity of the city's urban green areas. Analysis of a previously developed IKONOS 4-m spatial resolution classification of the city of San Juan from 2002 revealed a larger area of vegetation (green areas or green infrastructure) than previously estimated by moderate spatial resolution imagery. The city as a whole had approximately 42% green cover and 55% impervious surfaces. Although the city appeared greener in its southern upland sector compared to the northern coastal section, where most built-up urban areas occurred (66% impervious surfaces), northern San Juan had 677 ha more green area cover dispersed across the city than the southern component. MSPA revealed that most forest cover occurred as edges and cores, and green areas were most commonly forest cores, with larger predominance in the southern sector of the municipality. In dense, built-up, urban land, most of the green areas occurred in private yards as islets. When compared to other cities across the United States, San Juan was most similar in green cover features to Boston, Massachusetts, and Miami, Florida. Per capita green space for San Juan (122.2 m(2)/inhabitant) was also comparable to these two U. S. cities. This study explores the intra-urban vegetation variation in the city of San Juan, which is generally overlooked by moderate spatial resolution classifications in Puerto Rico. It serves as a starting point for green infrastructure mapping and landscape pattern analysis of the urban green spaces within the city of San Juan. The effectiveness of research and city planning will be further enhanced as a result of this type of finer-scale urban cover exploration.",10.5751/ES-06598-190321,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84911364562&doi=10.5751%2fES-06598-190321&partnerID=40&md5=0489b0a8d704b5b57425d1baaa93c583,Ecology and Society,1,10.5751/ES-06598-190321,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84911364562&doi=10.5751%2fES-06598-190321&partnerID=40&md5=0489b0a8d704b5b57425d1baaa93c583

Constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability. This paper selected Denko County of Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia, which is located in the desert oasis area, as the study area. Ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment, and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources, and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest-grass ecological network (FG eco-network) of the study area. This paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the FG ecological network. Moreover, the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the FG eco-network in 11 development scenarios. The results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario; the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness, PageRank, etc. have gradually decreased. The study found that the network density increases slightly in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development. Moreover, in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert, the FG eco-network within the sample circle expanded. This represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area. Under the existing natural conditions, the study area still has room for economic development, but space is limited. Based on the interaction force theory, this study provides a new approach to identifying the ecological network.

Location Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Methods Gradients in the cover of exotic plants, as well as the richness of exotic and native vascular species, were examined as a function of distance from anthropogenic forest boundaries and recreational trails. Plants were sampled in 2 m x 10 m and 10 m x 10 m plots distributed among 11 urban forest remnants. Randomization tests were used to quantify the distance of edge influence from both forest boundaries and trails, and to determine if there was an interaction between them. Results The cover and richness of exotic plants and richness of native species decreased with increasing distance from forest boundaries and trails. Edge influences extended to distances of ca. 50 and 3 m for forest boundaries and trails, respectively, and were stronger for measures of understorey than of overstorey vegetation. Vegetation was simultaneously influenced by both edge types such that exotic cover and richness were higher when in close proximity to two edges than when subject to either edge alone (i.e. a positive interaction). Conclusions It is important to consider the influence of edges in the design and management of forest remnants to improve the ability to conserve native biodiversity within cities.

Even if urbanisation is widely regarded as a major threat to global biodiversity, recent research highlighted the potential ecological importance of cities for pollinators. Key determinants of cities' ability to sustain pollinators are the presence of green areas and the connectivity between them. However, also temperature is expected to be of primary importance for pollinator activities. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of temperature, open habitat cover, and distance from the city centre on wild bee communities in the city of Rome (Italy). We selected 36 sites along two statistically independent gradients of temperature and open habitat cover, and we sampled wild bee communities using pan-traps for 4 months. Then, we measured functional traits of wild bee species, that is, body size, social behaviour, nesting strategy, and diet breadth. Temperature emerged as the main driver of wild bee communities, with communities richer in species and individuals at warmer temperatures. We found little species replacement between cold and warm sites. In addition, with increasing temperatures, bee communities were dominated by polylectic and small-bodied species. Here, we showed that in a highly urbanised environment, temperature shapes pollinator communities irrespective of other landscape metrics. Even if warming seemed beneficial for urban pollinator abundance and richness, it might strongly homogenise bee communities by selecting for those traits that make species more easily adaptable.",10.1111/icad.12602,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135787309&doi=10.1111%2ficad.12602&partnerID=40&md5=c048377a5e440ea26a265b31f9c866cd,Insect Conservation and Diversity,7,10.1111/icad.12602,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135787309&doi=10.1111%2ficad.12602&partnerID=40&md5=c048377a5e440ea26a265b31f9c866cd

Here, we evaluated how urbanization affects plant-hummingbird interactions at two spatial scales. First, in a medium-sized city from southeastern Brazil ( > 600,000 inhabitants), we contrasted interaction networks from urban and natural areas, and used artificial nectar feeder stations to evaluate changes in the composition of hummingbird assemblages across an urbanization gradient. Second, we compiled data on six urban plant-hummingbird interaction networks from south and southeastern Brazil to identify the characteristics associated with the most important plants. Locally, urbanization affected hummingbird communities by promoting higher generalization and dominance by more aggressive hummingbirds. Notably, specialized long-billed hermits were absent both in the urban interaction network and at feeder stations from more urbanized areas. Across networks, trees were more important for hummingbirds than shrubs/herbs as were specialized ornithophilous flowers in relation to non-ornithophilous flowers. Plant origin (native or exotic) did not matter. Our results indicate that urban plant-hummingbird communities are organized differently than their counterparts from natural areas, which usually feature key hermits and few trees. Since hermits provide important pollination services, especially for specialized ornithophilous plants, initiatives such as green corridors and preference for native plants with specialized hummingbird-pollinated flowers in urban landscaping may contribute to community restoration and ecosystem functioning.",10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.012,https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/publicacao/166490/plant-hummingbird-interaction-networks-in-urban-areas-gener/; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND606257430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313521,Biological Conservation,13,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.012,https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/publicacao/166490/plant-hummingbird-interaction-networks-in-urban-areas-gener/; https://europepmc.org/article/AGR/IND606257430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313521

However, the effectiveness of urban corridors on birds remains equivocal because vegetation corridor is often managed for human use with little consideration of wildlife. Here we compared the effects of three major corridors of varying vegetation structures (trees with a dense understory, trees with a sparse understory, and grassy areas with sparse trees) on the species richness and abundance of birds in 21 wooded patches in the center of Tokyo, Japan, during wintering and breeding seasons. Using generalized linear models and Akaike's information criterion, we found that the effectiveness of corridors depended on the tolerance of birds to urbanization. Urban avoider species, having low tolerance to urbanization, demonstrated lower species richness and abundance in patches close to the corridor with a sparsely vegetated understory as compared with patches close to the understory-richer corridors during winter, although such an effect disappeared during the breeding season. The corridors did not have a significant effect on suburban adapter species with a high tolerance to urbanization. Our results suggest that corridors with scarce understory vegetation may limit the persistence of birds avoiding urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events.

We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km(2) area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes.

However, this practice is often limited by incomplete information on the study species requirements and insufficient efforts to adopt robust inference modeling approaches. We developed occurrence and breeding habitat models for the European brown bear Ursus arctos in the Northern range of the poorly-known Carpathian population, focusing on the evaluation of a restricted set of hypotheses based on prevailing insights on the species constrains. Hypotheses were confronted using a dataset of 3151 bear observations in Poland for the period 1985-2005. Forest availability was the most important limiting factor, whereas anthropic factors (human density and urban areas) separated between suitable and non-suitable forest-rich areas. Forest composition contributed poorly to predict bear occurrence but was important to differentiate between breeding and non-breeding habitats: breeding females required a larger amount of forest cover, lower human influence and the interspersion of grassland/shrubland patches. Model transfer to the western Carpathian population in Slovakia supported the accuracy of habitat predictions and the robustness of the approach. Results highlight the need to control unplanned urban sprawl to preserve the species habitat and the connectivity between the Western and Eastern segments of the Carpathian population. Predicted but unoccupied habitats in other regions also require consideration, particularly some favorable areas of confluence with other large carnivore habitats. We encourage adopting robust hypothesis testing approaches in habitat modeling in order to support better model transferability and conservation planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Establishing and implementing the ecological function of urban green structures and conservation plans for urban terrestrial species requires prioritizing developing an understanding of the community structure of urban terrestrial species. However, understanding the appearance and distribution of terrestrial species in urban ecosystems is often neglected or lacking; furthermore, the inaccurate detection of species distribution can create biased estimates of species occupancy. Recently, an applied research method for detecting terrestrial species such as mammals and birds has been proposed based on molecular biology such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We installed artificial water tanks (mesocosm) in urban green spaces (Urban forests; UFs, Urban ecological corridors; UECs, Urban parks; UPs), applying eDNA metabarcoding as a tool to detect wild terrestrial species, and camera traps (CTs) and field surveys were performed in parallel to verify the results. We detected 22 urban terrestrial species only by eDNA metabarcoding and identified 43 species in total by performing eDNA metabarcoding, CTs, and field surveys in parallel. In addition, we identified 31 species of UFs, 13 species of UECs, and 28 species of UPs of urban terrestrial species using the three species survey methods in parallel. We confirmed that eDNA meta-barcoding is very useful for detecting small species that are difficult to detect with the naked eye and internal species vulnerable to disturbance. However, since some species were only detected by CTs or field surveys due to DNA false-negative errors or the species' life-history characteristics, it was judged that the species inventory can be effectively collected using several monitoring techniques.",10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127782,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141294729&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2022.127782&partnerID=40&md5=1d47c39a90f26c8371c6b6cb3e7c051f,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,3,10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127782,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141294729&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2022.127782&partnerID=40&md5=1d47c39a90f26c8371c6b6cb3e7c051f

I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban-rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m - 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement.

The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them. This methodological approach and the characterization of the Sousse city GBI map represent the first innovative research applied in Tunisia. This prototype can be a reference for other local or regional spaces, contributing toward realizing a national GBI and promoting sustainable projects.",10.3389/fenvs.2022.1061256,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145054986&doi=10.3389%2ffenvs.2022.1061256&partnerID=40&md5=2948965fea41375868b0537dcab301a9,Frontiers in Environmental Science,3,10.3389/fenvs.2022.1061256,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145054986&doi=10.3389%2ffenvs.2022.1061256&partnerID=40&md5=2948965fea41375868b0537dcab301a9

This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. Objectives To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Methods Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. Results The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Conclusions Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns.

Effective hedgehog conservation requires an understanding of the hedgehog's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Due to globally increasing urbanisation, the use of artificial light sources to illuminate the night, called light pollution, has spread dramatically. Light pollution significantly affects the behaviour and ecology of wildlife, but the hedgehog's behaviour towards light pollution remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of light pollution on the natural movement behaviour of hedgehogs living in an urban environment. Although hedgehogs can react very variably to environmental influences, the majority of hedgehogs studied here preferred to move in less illuminated rather than in strongly illuminated areas. This apparently rigid behaviour could be used in applied hedgehog conservation to connect isolated hedgehog populations or to safely guide the animals around places dangerous for them via dark corridors that are attractive for hedgehogs. With urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual's home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs' habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal's sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation.",10.3390/ani10081306,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459628; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306; https://core.ac.uk/download/340075712.pdf,Animals,4,10.3390/ani10081306,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7459628; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/8/1306; https://core.ac.uk/download/340075712.pdf

The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management.",10.1007/s11252-017-0677-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019001149&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-017-0677-y&partnerID=40&md5=b431137732ae9cf9eae49d34c8ba124c,Urban Ecosystems,4,10.1007/s11252-017-0677-y,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1973806233?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=TD40vtul8SHvL4R7zZDYMH3a6tw%3D

We examined how these drivers relate to Zeta diversity (zeta) for alien Passeriformes and Psittaciformes. We performed the analysis using multiple orders of zeta, which provides insight on the role played by rare and common species in determining levels of dissimilarity. We also ran the analyses using the community of native Passeriformes as a phylogenetically close contrasting control. Our results showed that the proportion of urban area, a variable related to colonization and propagule pressure, had a strong influence on Psittaciformes but not on alien Passeriformes. This latter group showed to be primarily influenced by environmental factors, similarly to what was found for native Passeriformes. On other hand, human connectivity, as measured by distance through roads and railways seemed to play a significant role in shaping the compositional dissimilarity of alien Passeriformes, but not Psittaciformes. Regardless of the group analysed, the relative importance of the explanatory variables was similar for both rare and common species. Our findings highlight differences between the factors driving compositional dissimilarity for distinct groups of birds.

Ensuring the delivery of these benefits requires an understanding of current and potential future forest conditions, yet urban forest dynamics are not well-understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining forest structure and composition in 126 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes (large [95-126 ha], medium [1-19 ha], and small [0.05-0.65 ha] patches) in the city of New Haven, CT. We detected significant shifts in forest structure and composition suggesting a suite of distinct successional trajectories within each patch size. Large patches comprised 95% native tree species in the canopy (>5 cm dbh), sapling (1-5 cm dbh), and seedling (<1 cm dbh) layers, suggesting that these large patches will continue to be native-dominated in the future-a primary objective for urban forest management. Moreover, in these large patches, shifts in the dominant species in each stratum suggest that as large patches move through succession they will transition from moderately shade-tolerant forest types (i.e., oaks) to shade-tolerant types (i.e., American beech)-a similar successional trajectory to surrounding second-growth forests in the region. Medium patches were the most heterogeneous patch size sampled. Despite this heterogeneity, they generally resembled large patches in the canopy and sapling layers but diverged in the seedling layer. In medium patches, the invasive Norway maple replaced American beech as primary seedling species suggesting a future shift toward non-native-dominated forest in the future. Small patches were the most compositionally and structurally distinct patch size sampled. Only 36% of the canopy trees and saplings in small patches were native species; however, this increased to 71% native in the seedling layer. Additionally, the most important seedling species included those that are bird-dispersed highlighting the potentially valuable role that these small, non-native, forest fragments play as wildlife corridors. Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple forest types, dynamics, and conditions can be found within a single city and that forest patch size offers a helpful framework to begin to parse out these differences.",10.1002/ecs2.4001,NA,Ecosphere,6,10.1002/ecs2.4001,NA

This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution???s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00???726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species.

Land use projections are rarely used due to their unavailability and, when available, are often at coarse spatial and thematic resolutions, making them unsuitable to capture fine scale habitat suitability. This study aims to (a) show how coupled land use change (LUC) models of high thematic resolution (HTR) can be used in species distribution models (SDM), (b) compare the impacts of HTR and low thematic resolution (LTR) explanatory predictors on biodiversity scenarios and (c) assess the impact of species' present area of occupancy on the effect of thematic resolution in SDMs. Location Belgium Taxon Bumblebees (Bombus) Methods We compared species distribution models with 17 land use predictors (HTR) against models with 5 land use predictors (LTR). We modelled the distribution of 17 bumblebee species in Belgium projected until 2035. We examined how model performance, variable importance and projections of distribution change differed depending on the thematic resolution of the land use predictors. Results Overall, HTR models performed better than LTR models. LTR models predicted greater extent per species. HTR projected a greater percentage of range gains, and both models projected similar losses of suitable habitat. However, the percentage loss and connectivity of suitable habitats varied differently for HTR and LTR models along a gradient of rare to common species. The HTR models projected greater loss of suitable areas for rare species and less loss for common species compared to LTR models. Main conclusions These results illustrate the importance of using ecologically relevant explanatory variables in SDMs, particularly for rare and localized species with specific habitat requirements. The results also indicate the need for large-scale LUC projections to improve future biodiversity scenarios under climate change and to improve the ability of conservationists and policymakers to use SDM projections.",10.1111/jbi.14000,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096649489&doi=10.1111%2fjbi.14000&partnerID=40&md5=0188070c5b843ab58cfc5d54a737779f,Journal of Biogeography,6,10.1111/jbi.14000,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096649489&doi=10.1111%2fjbi.14000&partnerID=40&md5=0188070c5b843ab58cfc5d54a737779f

While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities.

In this paper, we analyse and compare the morphologies and sustainability potential of residential suburbs and their gardens in two case studies: Traditional-suburban and Modern-suburban in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Spatial distributions of land-cover patterns were estimated using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). The four sustainability parameters measured were: roof rain water collection; local food (vegetable) production; energy and CO2 emission savings from clothes lines; and carbon benefits of onsite tree canopy cover. Outcomes suggest that land cover such as tree canopy cover and other permeable and impermeable surfaces in garden spaces can significantly impact on sustainability. Impermeable surface cover is higher in the Modern-suburban compared to the Traditional-suburban development. Traditional-suburban is more capable of supporting environmental and ecological functions through better connectivity of green spaces and availability of onsite land areas for local food production. Modern-suburban has more capacity for roof rainwater collection due to larger building roof sizes, provided there is planning for sufficient tank spaces in the design phases. These results identify specific characteristics of two suburban forms which could make positive contributions to suburban sustainability.

Wildlife show tremendous variation in their responses to urbanization; even within a single population, some individuals can specialize on urban or natural habitat types. This specialization could alter pathogen impacts on host populations via changes to wildlife movement and aggregation. Here, we build a mechanistic model to explore how habitat specialization in urban landscapes affects interactions between a mobile host population and a density-dependent specialist pathogen that confers no immunity. We model movement on a network of resource-stable urban sites and resource-fluctuating natural sites, where hosts are urban specialists, natural specialists, or generalists that use both patch types. We find that for generalists, natural and partially urban landscapes produce the highest infection prevalence and mortality, driven by high movement rates at natural sites and high densities at urban sites. However, habitat specialization protects hosts from these negative effects of partially urban landscapes by limiting movement between patch types. These findings suggest that habitat specialization can benefit populations by reducing infectious disease transmission, but by reducing movement between habitat types it could also carry the cost of reducing other movement-related ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and pollination.",10.1086/717655,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717655,American Naturalist,3,10.1086/717655,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717655

Orange County is one of the last strongholds for this pond-breeding amphibian in the region, and ongoing restoration efforts targeting S. hammondii have involved habitat protection and the construction of artificial breeding ponds. These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought.

Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

While high resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density - 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m(2), aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery - 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7 -11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2-8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area. As for the spatial distribution, ecological sources of Fengxian County are mainly located in the central and southwestern areas, which is highly coincident with the main rivers and underground drinking water source area. Moreover, key corridors and main corridors with length of approximately 115.71 km and 26.22 km, respectively, formed ecological corridors of Fengxian County. They are concentrated in the western and southwestern regions of the county which is far away from the built-up areas with strong human disturbance. The results will provide scientific evidence for important ecological land protection and ecological space control at a small scale in underdeveloped and plain counties.

Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity.

Building area and electric wire density had no detectable effect on crossing probability for four species. Seasonal difference in the crossing probability was found only for Varied Tit, and the probability was the highest in the breeding season.

Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species.

We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces.

In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.",10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059859030&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-019-0825-7&partnerID=40&md5=d4201059e80a3e7e9ea18e26ab9875c3,Urban Ecosystems,3,10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6337663; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193274834; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-019-0825-7

In 1966, around 45% of the land had a high or very high level of connectivity, and almost 38% in 1981. By 2010 only 6.5% of the landscape was connected and 73% of the territory possessed no or low connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the natural river, the urban river is seriously affected by human activities, which are constructed with the hope of recreating a similar natural environment and are uniquely designed so that ecological specialists, landscape experts and scientists could study both the surrounding environment's ecological effects and the continuity degree of the river corridor area. A system, including 10 indices urban river corridor, is established. This assessment method adapts the Analytic Hierarchy Process, GIS data analysis and GIS space technology, and is combined with these methods based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. Using the results obtained by studying the Suzhou River Corridor and the assessment of ecological continuity is completed and the spatial distribution characteristics are approved, thus it allows future development throughout the corridor. Eventually, a development policy is proposed. Firstly, a method to improve the landscape connectivity among the river's greenways is needed. Secondly, a high value area with ecological continuity related to the river greenway is planned along the river greenway. Thirdly, a sufficient natural area is needed to give the area a river corridor influence, maintain the river's ecological continuity, and keep this natural area undisturbed by zoning. Lastly, the plant species distribution need to link ecological traits and landscape matrix. The study of this assessment method provides a rational development path and decision-making basis for the construction of healthy and sustainable urban river corridors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal. Such information is critical for assessing existing or potential habitats and corridors and developing strategic plans to balance habitat conservation and other land uses based on scientifically informed connectivity planning and implementation.",10.1111/cobi.13682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33477199/; https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cobi.13682,Conservation Biology,8,10.1111/cobi.13682,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100174384&doi=10.1111%2fcobi.13682&partnerID=40&md5=1ba4765121887a2c9659eeb484fec67e

This is particularly the case in fast-growing South Korean city regions. While nature conservation policies were recently adopted that require the creation of habitat corridors, there is a lack of ecological information and tools for effective biodiversity conservation planning. This research has developed and customised an approach that combined landscape character assessment with four landscape ecological metrics to provide quantitative information on the ecological conditions for biodiversity conservation planning at the city regional level. The metrics used in this study were landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch distance and patch context. These indices were simple to use and required land cover data that were recorded from aerial photography and a digital topographic map. The metrics indicated the highest species richness, highest potential for species dispersal and highest ecological stability for the mountain landscape, followed by the urban fringe, agricultural land and the urban area.

Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are felids capable of living in urban environments, but are sensitive to habitat fragmentation and, thus, useful indicators of landscape connectivity; in particular, bobcat habitat selection, movement, and mortality may be affected by roads. We analyzed movement patterns of 52 bobcats in southern California in three study sites and investigated: (1) how bobcats responded to two types of roads within their home ranges; (2) how they placed their home ranges with respect to roads within the study area; and (3) whether male and female bobcats differed in their behavioral responses to roads. Within home ranges, primary and secondary roads did not influence movements, but bobcats more frequently crossed secondary roads when road densities were higher within their home ranges, thus increasing mortality risk. However, road densities within each study site were several times higher than road densities within home ranges, suggesting bobcats selected against roaded areas in home-range placement. Male home ranges bordering roads were smaller than home ranges for other males, but male home ranges containing roads were larger than those without roads. Male bobcats also were more likely to cross roads than females, potentially reflecting larger male home range sizes. Our results suggest roads have important impacts on urban bobcats, with stronger effects on males than females, and continued efforts to mitigate the effects of roads on carnivores and other fragmentation-sensitive species would help promote connectivity conservation in urban systems.

As expected, patch area was the most significant variable explaining patch occupancy of resident and summering woodland birds in every season. Our data about the number of dominant vegetation suggest that larger areas contain greater habitat heterogeneity and more diverse niches. About half of the resident species did not appear to be area-sensitive and were categorized as edge species.

We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.",10.1007/s10531-008-9332-5,http://www.prbo.org/refs/files/11916_Luther2008.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9332-5; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9332-5/fulltext.html,Biodiversity and Conservation,6,10.1007/s10531-008-9332-5,http://www.prbo.org/refs/files/11916_Luther2008.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9332-5; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10531-008-9332-5/fulltext.html

Such phenomena are particularly harmful for amphibian species, characterized by disjunct breeding habitats. The dispersal behaviour of amphibians being poorly understood, it is crucial to develop new tools, allowing us to determine the influence of landscape connectivity on the persistence of populations. In this study, we developed a new landscape genetics approach that aims at identifying land-uses affecting genetic differentiation, without a priori assumptions about associated ecological costs. We surveyed genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci for 19 Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) populations in western Switzerland. Using strips of varying widths that define a dispersal corridor between pairs of populations, we were able to identify land-uses that act as dispersal barriers (i.e. urban areas) and corridors (i.e. forests). Our results suggest that habitat destruction and landscape fragmentation might in the near future affect common species such as M. alpestris.

We investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the 200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover, species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also influenced species composition of bats and species richness of functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function in agricultural landscapes.",10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443&type=printable; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231029; http://mirjam-knoernschild.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Heim_et_al_2015.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/150231475; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4521758; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1034443H/abstract; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/table/pone.0134443.t002/; https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/26866; https://paperity.org/p/73755762/the-importance-of-landscape-elements-for-bat-activity-and-species-richness-in; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/; https://stri.si.edu/sites/publications/PDFs/2015_Tschapka_Knorschild.pdf; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,Plos One,5,10.1371/journal.pone.0134443,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443&type=printable; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231029; http://mirjam-knoernschild.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Heim_et_al_2015.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/display/150231475; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4521758; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1034443H/abstract; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/table/pone.0134443.t002/; https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/26866; https://paperity.org/p/73755762/the-importance-of-landscape-elements-for-bat-activity-and-species-richness-in; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521758/; https://stri.si.edu/sites/publications/PDFs/2015_Tschapka_Knorschild.pdf; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134443

Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations.

The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer.

The population genetic structure of the generalist skink Ctenotus fallens was examined using nine microsatellite markers within and among natural vegetation remnants within a highly fragmented urban matrix in the Perth metropolitan area in Western Australia. These data were compared with samples from a large unfragmented site on the edge of the urban area. Overall, estimates of genetic diversity and inbreeding within all populations were similar and low. Weak genetic differentiation, and a significant association between geographic and genetic distance, suggests historically strong genetic connectivity that decreases with geographic distance. Due to recent fragmentation, and genetic inertia associated with low genetic diversity and large population sizes, it is not possible from these data to infer current genetic connectivity levels.

Although agriculture is a major factor in these land use changes, development of peri-urban areas is also driving the simplification of habitat structure through removal of both native and weedy understorey species and the subdivision of remnant habitat. This study investigated the influence of habitat modification and fragmentation on birds in an urbanizing area of south east Queensland, Australia. The influence of spatial factors, such as surrounding vegetation cover, was considered alongside that of site-level habitat factors (vegetation structure) including interspecific competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Spatial factors did not influence the abundance and species richness of small passerines, a group of conservation concern. However, site-level factors, specifically shrub density and interspecific competition from the noisy miner, had a substantial influence on small passerine species richness and abundance. The density of shrubs (which consisted mainly of the introduced weed Lantana camara) had a strong positive relationship with small passerines while the abundance of noisy miners had a strong negative influence. Consequently, protection of vegetation with an intact shrub layer in this developing area is essential for many small birds of conservation significance. Removal of weedy understorey plants should be accompanied by replacement with native shrubs. The results of the study emphasize that factors other than the spatial distribution of vegetation in the landscape need to be considered in order to develop appropriate conservation strategies.

These localities are included in a landscape with remnants of lowland forests surrounded by cattle pastures, plantations, urban areas, and roads. Our results suggest a genetic population with moderate genetic diversity that was observed at most studied loci, with a statistically non-significant difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity. Most of the genetic variation was observed within rather than among sampled populations. The Mantel test showed a non-significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance.

Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal.

We show, for the first time, that anthropogenic gradients structure interaction networks, and exert greater structuring force than geographical proximity. We further showed that species turnover, especially of plants, is the major driver of interaction turnover, and that this contribution increased with anthropogenic induced environmental dissimilarity, but not spatial distance. Finally, to explore the extent to which it is possible to predict each of the components of interaction turnover, we compared the predictive performance of models that included site characteristics and interaction properties to models that contained species level effects. We show that if we are to accurately predict interaction turnover, data are required on the species-specific responses to environmental gradients.

This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County.",10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120433,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134888840&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2022.120433&partnerID=40&md5=56bf4814e1f59428079d60bbda27a412,Forest Ecology and Management,2,10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120433,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134888840&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2022.120433&partnerID=40&md5=56bf4814e1f59428079d60bbda27a412

We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings.

Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds.

Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.",10.1017/S0007485317000153,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013997268&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485317000153&partnerID=40&md5=87d7a82f0bc4fcb287170b96281d2e9d,Bulletin of Entomological Research,2,10.1017/S0007485317000153,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013997268&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485317000153&partnerID=40&md5=87d7a82f0bc4fcb287170b96281d2e9d

Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations. To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments. Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2 x 2 km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses. For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of broadleaved woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations. At the 2 x 2 km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages.

Success of eradications is dependent on knowledge of population connectivity in order to determine reinvasion pathways, and hence populations requiring simultaneous eradication (eradication units). The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) was introduced into New Zealand from Australia and Tasmania, and now occupies a wide range of habitats across the majority of New Zealand. Possums are one of the most destructive invaders within New Zealand, with extensive control operations occurring throughout the country. Understanding the population connectivity of possums on mainland New Zealand (North and South Islands) will enhance the success of planned eradications. We examined the genetic population structure of invasive possums to identify gene flow, thus reinvasion pathways, between seven populations around Dunedin and on the Otago Peninsula where eradication of possums is occurring. Genetic variation at 12 microsatellite loci was comparable between all sampled populations and exhibited a significant isolation by distance pattern. Bayesian clustering methods supported the existence of two population clusters, indicating the presence of a reinvasion pathway onto the Otago Peninsula from urban areas at the Southern end of the Peninsula. To avoid recolonisation, all possums on the Otago Peninsula should be eradicated simultaneously, with the implementation and ongoing maintenance and monitoring of an urban buffer zone. We recommend pre-eradication genetic analyses be adopted by all pest managers to define appropriate eradication units, thereby maximising eradication success and avoiding costly failures.",10.1007/s10530-013-0586-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902295957&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-013-0586-9&partnerID=40&md5=501630ce67a831df2fc0deb6eb3df6fa,Biological Invasions,4,10.1007/s10530-013-0586-9,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-013-0586-9; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-013-0586-9/fulltext.html; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20143208671; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-013-0586-9

We show that in areas characterised by a high urbanisation rate (> 56% impervious land cover), a large decrease of both genetic diversity (loss of 60-80% of initial observed heterozygosity) and population size (loss of 70-90% of individuals) is observed over time. This is confirmed by empirical data available for the mobile butterfly species Pieris rapae in a subpart of the study area. Comparing simulated data for P. rapae with its normal dispersal ability and with a reduced dispersal ability, we also show that a higher dispersal ability can be an advantage to survive in an urban or highly fragmented environment.

These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing animal population sizes in disturbed habitats. With time, this can lead to declines in effective population size and genetic diversity which restrict the ability of wildlife to efficiently cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects generally hold across taxa. We address this question by repurposing and synthesizing raw microsatellite data from online repositories for 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 georeferenced sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density, the Human Footprint Index, and impervious surface cover, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found minimal evidence, either positive or negative, for relationships between genetic metrics and urbanization. Together with previous work on focal species that also found varying effects of urbanization on genetic composition, it seems likely that the consequences of urbanization are not easily generalizable within or across amphibian species. Questions about the genetic consequences of urbanization for amphibians should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. This contrasts with general negative effects of urbanization in mammals and consistent, but species-specific, positive and negative effects in birds.",10.1111/mec.16005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107795987&doi=10.1111%2fmec.16005&partnerID=40&md5=60c346df156f11ef5647894fe1a072f0,Molecular Ecology,2,10.1111/mec.16005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107795987&doi=10.1111%2fmec.16005&partnerID=40&md5=60c346df156f11ef5647894fe1a072f0

Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management.

Here, the possibility of applying the migratory connectivity framework to understanding contamination in birds is illustrated by considering flame retardants in inviable eggs of a migratory raptor, the black kite (Milvus migrans). The occurrence and concentration of legacy and emerging compounds in eggs from the southeastern peri-urban area of Madrid city, central Spain, were compared with those from Donana National Park in southern Spain. A much higher occurrence and concentration of multiple polybrominated diphenyl ethers and Dechlorane 602 were found in Madrid than Donana, but the opposite patterns were found for Dechlorane Plus. Individuals from these and other breeding areas in western Europe showed a strong intermixing pattern over widespread wintering areas in Africa, as assessed by ringing recoveries and movements tracked by satellite devices. This diffuse migratory connectivity reveals breeding areas as the main contamination grounds. High contamination burdens sequestered in eggs point to rapid assimilation of these compounds before laying, associated with important emission sources in Madrid, especially landfills of partially incinerated urban refuse, and other anthropogenic operations. Diet composition regarding aquatic vs. terrestrial prey, and bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes are suggested to explain differential assimilation of some compounds, especially Dechlorane Plus in Donana, although a local emission source polluting this area cannot be ruled out. Insight from the migratory connectivity framework can help to disentangle large-scale patterns of contaminant uptake and refocus attention on key regions and potential causes of chemical hazards in declining migratory species and human populations.",10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049089436&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2018.06.037&partnerID=40&md5=37e2475c33fdec28a4e5cea20431c6ca,Environmental Research,8,10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.037,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29960221; https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/196318; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193052995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118303414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29960221; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ER....166..553B/abstract; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6465367

This remains particularly difficult for species where there is no obvious demarcation of geographical populations and dispersal patterns are poorly known. This is often the case in amphibian species that reproduce in aquatic habitats but live otherwise in terrestrial habitats. Sampling of such species usually occurs in the aquatic habitat (i.e., breeding sites) but these may represent neither genetically nor demographically distinct populations. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure of a stream-breeding species, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) along a rural-to-urban land use gradient. We used genetic data and Bayesian clustering approaches, which rely on genetic information without assuming predefined populations, to delineate distinctive genetic units along this gradient, and compare genetic diversity between rural and urban areas. The different analytical approaches used partitioned our dataset in slightly different but highly congruent clusters, that included localities which were up to 19 km apart from each other. Genetic breaks occurred at unexpected places while several landscape features reported to act as barriers on gene flow for amphibians did not lead to genetic breaks.

We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at < 8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance.

Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.

A key unanswered question is how urban subpopulations interact with their precedent exurban subpopulations. Two general models have been proposed to describe relationships among subpopulations in a metapopulation: (1) source-sink, where immigrants from sources sustain sinks; and (2) balanced dispersal, where dispersal is proportionally equal among subpopulations. I evaluated whether either of these models predict metapopulation dynamics of urban and exurban Cooper's Hawks in central New Mexico using demographic data in a Bayesian integrated population model. All urban female Cooper's Hawks began breeding in their first year; 69% settled at nests in the urban subpopulation and 31% emigrated and settled in an exurban subpopulation. The high rate of female emigration was likely because of a shortage of breeding urban males, caused by a 1 yr delay in male age-at-first-breeding. Emigration exceeded immigration by nearly 30%, making a balanced-dispersal model implausible. Although the urban subpopulation was a source, the primary recipient subpopulation was not a sink; urban emigrants appeared to have a competitive advantage obtaining exurban nest sites. High urban winter prey abundance supported year-long residency among urban female Cooper's Hawks, whereas nearly all exurban females migrated.

Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on mtDNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts.",10.1007/s10592-021-01350-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103386832&doi=10.1007%2fs10592-021-01350-5&partnerID=40&md5=9265464eb2879ffd06ee1b0a43cd6a85,Conservation Genetics,5,10.1007/s10592-021-01350-5,https://elib.tiho-hannover.de/dissertations/stanslowskyn_ws14.pdf=Q%20application/pdf; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10592-021-01350-5.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-021-01350-5

This in turn may cause cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland) remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion, it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation for residential development could disrupt the integrity of plant-pollinator assemblages.",10.1007/s11252-020-01089-w,NA,Urban Ecosystems,2,10.1007/s11252-020-01089-w,NA

A new descriptive method is proposed to establish the sustainable conservation strategy of protected wildlife in the current urbanization scenario. We use the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST-HQ), straightforward construction package of complex ecological niche Ecological Niche Modeling at The MetaLand EcologyLab (ENMTML) and ecological corridors construction model Species Distribution Model toolbox (SDMtoolbox) to distinguish the priority protected areas (PAs) and construct the ecological corridors of Gallinula chloropus (G. chloropus) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China in 2018. The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention. Furthermore, concrete measures to build ecological corridors which connect PAs in BTH region are proposed.

The effects of urbanization and roads are expected to be species-specific due to differences in species habitat requirements. We examined the influence of urbanization and roads on the occurrences of 16 non-native plant species in over 2000 wetlands within the Chicago metropolitan region in northeastern Illinois, USA. We found that species, or groups of species, responded differently to the effects of urbanization, roads, and proximity to conspecific populations. Occurrences of halophyte species were best predicted by road variables; halophytes were more commonly associated with major roads such as interstates and federal highways, road types that are likely to receive greater applications of de-icing salts. Several species were associated with proximity to Chicago. Proximity to Chicago may serve as a proxy for the degree of urbanization; or alternatively, may reflect a pattern of outward dispersal from an initial establishment point in the urban center. All study species were positively associated with distance to the nearest occupied wetland, implying that for each species, wetlands were more likely to be occupied if closer to other occupied sites.

Along with established ecological restoration practices, knowledge of genetic variation in existing and restored forest fragments is important for ensuring the maintenance of natural levels of genetic variation and connectivity (gene flow) among populations. The application of restoration genetics often employs anonymous 'fingerprinting' markers in combination with limited sample sizes due to financial constraints. Here, we used two such marker systems, AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphism) and ISSRs (inter-simple sequence repeats), to estimate population-level genetic variation of a frequently used species in restoration projects in New Zealand, mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus, Violaceae). We examined two rural and two urban forest fragments, as potential local source populations, to determine whether the mahoe population at the recently (re)constructed ecosystem at Waiwhakareke Natural Heritage Park, Hamilton, New Zealand, reflects the genetic variation observed in these four potential source populations. Both marker systems produced similar results and indicated that, even with small population sizes, levels of genetic variation at the heritage park were comparable with in situ populations. However, the AFLPs did provide finer resolution of the population genetic structure than ISSRs. ISSRs, which are less expensive and technically less demanding to generate than AFLPs, may be sufficient for restoration projects where only a broad level of genotypic resolution is required. We recommend the use of AFLPs when species with a high conservation status are being used, due to the greater resolution of this technique.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928810064&partnerID=40&md5=cc8baf463d414f5ea19d7fc35a1c23a8,New Zealand Journal of Ecology,5,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928810064&partnerID=40&md5=cc8baf463d414f5ea19d7fc35a1c23a8

Our objective is to determine whether pine tree cover (early-successional species) and oak tree cover (late-successional species), used as a surrogate of successional stage of peri-urban fragmented forests in the Valles lowlands (Catalonia, NE, Spain), are primarily determined by (1) climate and topography; (2) anthropogenic disturbances; (3) patch structure; or (4) patch dynamics from 1956 to 1993. Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. tree cover were separately recorded on 252 randomly selected plots of 100 m(2), within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 to 218 ha. Multiple linear regressions indicated that forest patch history is the most important variable determining oak and pine tree cover: new forest patches showed higher pine and lower oak tree cover than recently split patches (i.e. those that became fragmented from large forest areas after 1956). Patches already existing as such in 1956 (pre-existent patches) showed higher pine cover than recently split patches. Oak cover increased and pine cover decreased with increasing forest connectivity of the patch. Finally, highly frequented forests were related to high cover of pines. Climatic and topographic variables were not significant. We conclude that pine and oak cover in these peri-urban forests are mainly determined by recent patch dynamics, but also by the spatial pattern of patches.

However, the habitats that border roads ('road verges') form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES). We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km(2) and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle-wildlife collisions. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.",10.1111/1365-2664.13556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078061617&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.13556&partnerID=40&md5=24002fa401dbae54b55aaac741ee6e69,Journal of Applied Ecology,4,10.1111/1365-2664.13556,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/39645/9/Phillips_et_al-2020-Journal_of_Applied_Ecology.pdf; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1365-2664.13556; https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/39645; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13556; https://core.ac.uk/download/266991703.pdf

However, human activities that fragment aerial habitat with built structures, noise, and chemical or light pollution, may limit the ability of wildlife to use airspace efficiently. Applying landscape connectivity theory to aerial habitats could reveal how long-distance migrants respond to sources of aerial habitat fragmentation along their migratory routes. Artificial light at night is a major component of urbanization that fragments dark skies across North America. Attraction of nocturnal migrants to urban light is well documented, but species-specific responses, especially throughout a full migration from breeding to wintering grounds, are not. We tested hypotheses about long-distance migratory movements in relation to artificial light using a highly nocturnal, Nearctic-Neotropical avian migrant (Eastern whip-poor-will Antrostomus vociferus). We applied a resource selection framework at multiple spatial scales to explore whether GPS-tracked birds (n = 10) responded to urbanization in general, or artificial light specifically, during migratory flights. We found little evidence of attraction to artificial light during nocturnal flights. Artificial light and urbanization were highly correlated and difficult to disentangle, but the birds generally avoided urban areas and selected dark-connected skies for travel. Migratory stopovers (locations where GPS-tracked birds (n = 20) paused for at least one night), were located almost exclusively in dark, rural areas.

Marina Baja region (Spain) is selected to make a regional analysis. In the GIS modelling process, a suitability value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the habitat preference of the species.

These polygons are combined with the 'suitability' layer to obtain potentiality values, involving the displacement of the wild boar impedances within each Voronoi polygon. Finally, it performs the cartographic generalization process to obtain the resulting potential areas.

We collected 215 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban-to-rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near-panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban-to-rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands.",10.1111/eva.13133,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33519963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819555; https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/nrs_facpubs/195/; https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&context=nrs_facpubs; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/eva.13133; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.13133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519963,Evolutionary Applications,13,10.1111/eva.13133,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33519963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819555; https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/nrs_facpubs/195/; https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&context=nrs_facpubs; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/eva.13133; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.13133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519963

Establishing native species assemblages on green roofs may help conserve native plant diversity in urban areas, but these assemblages are susceptible to colonization by species from the surrounding landscape. In natural communities, colonization from the regional species pool reflects the filtering effects of both abiotic and biotic factors, but the relative effects of these factors on green roof colonization are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied colonization dynamics of 10 green roofs in New York City (NY, United States), each established at the same time with the same source materials. On each roof, 12 plots were established, with one-half of each plot planted with an erect C-4 graminoid dominant (Hempstead Plains: HP) and the other half with a tuft C-3 graminoid and forb dominant (Rocky Summit: RS) species assemblage derived from native communities. Six of the 12 split-plots contained shallow growing medium, while the other six contained deeper growing medium. Resident plants were planted in October 2010. Fifty-eight non-resident plant species colonized plots between August 2011 and August 2012, with two native and 10 non-native species accounting for 90% of total colonist dry mass. Colonist dry mass and richness decreased with increasing resident plant cover, but the effects of growing medium depth on colonist dry mass and richness differed between assemblages. Forbs accounted for 81% of the colonist dry mass from the HP assemblage, but just 31% in the RS assemblage. Further, forbs accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in June and July, while graminoids accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in August. These results indicate colonization of planted green roofs may be strongly affected by the composition of established plant assemblages and that these effects may vary temporally with colonist management regime, even within a single growing season. Further, the inconsistent effects of growing medium depth suggest that niche overlap and complementarity in rhizosphere dynamics may influence colonization more in some systems compared with others. Additional research is required to describe the effects of colonist management strategies, as well as the roles of priority effects, niche complementarity and community assembly, on long-term dynamics of colonization on green roofs planted with native plants.",10.3389/fevo.2018.00238,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,4,10.3389/fevo.2018.00238,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2018.00238/full

An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.",10.1002/ece3.8804,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128832902&doi=10.1002%2fece3.8804&partnerID=40&md5=c4f61cc32631643c62866f4d0e6f8127,Ecology and Evolution,11,10.1002/ece3.8804,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656023345?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=p3pLiwPodzzg%2F%2FCXhaV%2B%2BOYgug0%3D

Little is known about the habitat requirements for the amphipods and isopods that live there, and forest quality and other surface parameters have been largely unexplored. Urban parks, encompassing protected lands from ballfields to forests, are not necessarily secure sites, because of non-compatible uses and changing park boundaries. Almost all records for this fauna in the study area are in parks. Using data from sampling in parklands of south-east Washington, DC, exploratory analyses were conducted at two spatial scales - the seeps and pervious land patches surrounded by impervious surfaces (which range from 0.59 to 231 ha). Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended.

Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong'an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities. Methods. A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity. Results. Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD). Discussion. Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species ff-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.",10.7717/peerj.7961,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2334474942?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=yZG1hGGmWseORAPLeiaQEkEGiV4%3D,Peerj,7,10.7717/peerj.7961,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2334474942?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=yZG1hGGmWseORAPLeiaQEkEGiV4%3D

Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity. These results are clearly useful and essential pieces of information that can be applied in urban planning to improve climate adaptability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, we lack basic information on how green roofs contribute to biodiversity and how their placement in the urban landscape affects different taxa and community composition. We studied the effects of local and landscape variables on beetle communities on green roofs. We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from 17 green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dry-habitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most influential factors affecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats.",10.1016/j.ufug.2017.11.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034829208&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2017.11.009&partnerID=40&md5=6a6f7b8b7c8290c52614967d74fb7485,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,6,10.1016/j.ufug.2017.11.009,https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/local-habitat-characteristics-have-a-stronger-effect-than-the-sur; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866717301802; https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/11310

Light pollution is a near inseparable feature of human-altered landscapes and is a potential contributing factor to insect declines. However, despite the wide recognition of the deleterious effects of lights on insects, whether these effects scale up to impact insect populations remains unclear. Here, we relied on a combination of ecological niche modeling, geographical information systems, and interviews on local ecological knowledge to assess the synergistic effects of landscape light pollution and habitat loss and fragmentation on populations of the Choc ' o golden scarab Chrysina argenteola. Sightings of C. argenteola by locals revealed individuals are scarcer in areas with reduced forest cover and rely on inter-patch dispersal to cope with habitat fragmentation, where they were constantly attracted to urban lights. Increasingly lit landscapes had more individuals attracted to lights, but the opposite was true in areas with less than 4 km2 of remaining forest cover. We suggest this pattern arises as landscape light pollution intercepts individuals during inter-patch dispersal. This hinders habitat connectivity, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics, being populations inhabiting areas with scarce fragmented habitat more vulnerable to this process. We show light pollution acts in combination with habitat loss and fragmentation in detriment of insect populations at the landscape scale.",10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109311,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118803894&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109311&partnerID=40&md5=86539087e085e9f47ee29d44811de60e,Biological Conservation,3,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109311,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118803894&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109311&partnerID=40&md5=86539087e085e9f47ee29d44811de60e

Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.",10.3390/su141912123,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139780457&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912123&partnerID=40&md5=4d7055fac262098eba44ac5139d4099f,Sustainability,3,10.3390/su141912123,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724317606?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=BfKrLFUkPsV779vhO52gmRh9uoQ%3D

In the 21st century, urban development and sea level rise (SLR) are predicted to affect large areas of the United States, further exacerbating already fragmented and densely populated landscapes. Increasing or restoring habitat connectivity may ameliorate these effects, but the broad-reaching efforts required to assess current and future changes to connectivity, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to SLR, are still under development. To address these issues, we strategically identified a small group of regionally significant species that represent a range of characteristics and ecological requirements useful for examining landscape connectivity. We used expert opinion to parameterize divergent species responses (i.e. resistance) to landscape features and to assess permeability of the landscape. From this, we estimated contemporary and future low-resistance habitat cores in the year 2100. We modeled six species for habitat connectivity using a multiscaled circuit theory-based approach and analysed them collectively to indicate landscape connectivity across the Southeastern United States. Using this approach, we were able to forecast changing connectivity patterns based on predicted urbanization and SLR. Our results suggest that there will be a 41% reduction in the number of low-resistance cores and a 35% decrease in mean area of remaining cores. In addition, current areas of high landscape connectivity will become more fragmented as future connectivity values indicate a more homogenized landscape structure. In the future landscape, pathways for connectivity are likely to move inland and northward as sea level and urbanization pressures increase.

A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately ""wildlife-friendly"", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0259537,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118985924&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0259537&partnerID=40&md5=76b01a35119c4e640228a6e09aedf52d,Plos One,4,10.1371/journal.pone.0259537,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118985924&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0259537&partnerID=40&md5=76b01a35119c4e640228a6e09aedf52d

Understanding the dynamics of urban ecosystem services is essential for planning and managing the practice of urban green infrastructure. This paper aims to assess spatial distribution of urban green areas and calculate two regulating ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and runoff retention) generated by green infrastructure in Bornova, which is one of the metropolitan districts of the city of Izmir, Turkey. Results show that although almost 45% of the district is covered by components of the green infrastructure, they are mostly small and unevenly distributed in the current urban fabric with low connectivity. The total carbon sequestration capacity of the green infrastructure is estimated 8368.25 t year(-1) and the total rate of runoff is predicted at 3,788,651.31 m(3).

Degradation, pollution, and deterioration along riparian corridors in urban landscapes change species composition and biodiversity. Birds are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ecological changes. The main objective of our study was to spatially compare bird species richness, abundance, and community structure along the Asar River, an urban riparian corridor in Duzce, Turkey. We identified 63 bird species, comprising 6722 individuals, and classified them into one of three groups: generalist species (11 species), woodland species (40 species), and waterbird species (12 species). Bird species richness was positively related to vegetative cover and negatively to urbanization. Richness was low in the winter and was higher during spring and summer. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores (mean = 54.8 +/- 33.7; max. = 97 and min. = 5) were relatively low for all sampling plots and was reduced by human activities (e.g., roads, farmland, settlement). The number of woodland bird species changed positively (r = 0.71) with RQI. The generalist bird species, adapted to urbanization, were more common around settlements and open areas. Human population and settlement around Asar River increased one-third and farmland and natural habitat decreased onefifth during the last decade. The area has high potential for growth and increased urbanization, thus increasing the pressure on the natural areas. Activities that diminish the amount of tree cover in the riparian corridor should be avoided. Habitat restoration and rehabilitation will increase RQI values, which can be used as indicators for bird richness in urban landscapes and benefit avian diversity along the riparian corridor.

Ponds also provide important habitats for species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment. Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity.

The nature of the matrix impacts the persistence of species in human-modified landscapes through its pervasive influence on adjacent habitat and through the habitat value of the matrix itself. However, previous studies have not isolated the effects of the matrix from the effects of other aspects of landscape modification, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, and much remains to be understood about the independent impact of the matrix on wildlife. We investigated the effects of the matrix on mammal abundance and landscape use in south-east Queensland, Australia. Mammals were surveyed in patch 'core', patch 'edge' and 'matrix' landscape elements along a rural-suburban gradient of matrix development intensity quantified by a weighted road-length metric, which was significantly correlated with housing density, while controlling for potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes. Response to increasing matrix development intensity was highly species-specific. Several native species declined in abundance; however, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels of matrix development intensity. Exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. An ability to use the matrix per se, however, may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix.",10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x/abstract; https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:238258; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x; https://core.ac.uk/display/15113896; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113069278,Austral Ecology,5,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x/abstract; https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:238258; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02110.x; https://core.ac.uk/display/15113896; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113069278

Recently, urban management has relied on a 'renaturing' strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity.

Records Near Human Settlements and Insights into Human-Carnivore Coexistence in Central Chile,Animals,Animals,11,NA,"Simple Summary The presence of carnivores near human settlements is a poorly studied topic that generates concern and perception of risk in some human communities, especially for medium to large felids. Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human-carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes. The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes.

Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity.

For this invasion to be controlled, even partially, it is important to understand the dominant routes, mechanisms, and rates of weed spread across landscapes. With their linear corridors of disturbed habitats, roadsides are thought to play a large role in the spread of some weeds. We used both new surveys and existing data to assess which of the 328 environmental weeds listed by the Department of Conservation are most frequently found on roadsides, where, and whether distribution patterns are consistent with linear dispersal. We also analysed historical survey data for relationships between reserve weediness and proximity to roads. We surveyed 340 plots of 100-m-long stretches of roadside across four regions and found between 2 and 19 environmental weeds per plot; 128 species in total (Chao estimate 148). Especially abundant were agricultural species (weeds and cultivated), species that have been naturalised for well over 50 years, and species that disperse externally attached to vertebrates. While we purposefully sampled within 10 km of town limits, we found no strong effect of distance from town on roadside weed richness, including richness of just ornamentally sourced weeds. Instead, number of houses within 250 m and presence of an adjacent house or other residential structure were both important, as was presence of woody vegetation on and adjacent to roadsides. Reserves adjacent to roads had significantly higher weed richness than reserves further from roads, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. Our results suggest that while roadsides include suitable habitats for most environmental weeds, distributions are patchy and roads show little sign of acting as linear dispersal corridors, instead largely reflecting neighbouring land uses. As such, roadside weeds should best be managed as part of the wider landscape.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72749106354&partnerID=40&md5=721377cef3d59971a65139917432a105,New Zealand Journal of Ecology,4,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72749106354&partnerID=40&md5=721377cef3d59971a65139917432a105

Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees. Thus, in order to increase arthropod diversity in urban landscapes, it is important to select tree species that attract a large number of arthropod taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Taking Hangzhou, a typical ecologically sensitive but rapidly urbanizing area, as the case study, a GI network was established according to the quantification and mapping of diverse ES values. The equivalent ES value in China based on Xie?s table was adjusted by calculating the priority index and the spatial difference index, and then the adjusted value was applied to obtain the spatial distribution of the comprehensive ES value in Hangzhou. On this basis, the high-level spatial agglomeration area with the highest comprehensive ES value was extracted as a hub using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, while the accumulated channel with the lowest cost of comprehensive ES value was generated as a corridor through the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Both the established GI network and its buffer were delineated as the GI conservation area, which further supported the revision of the construction area in the Hangzhou Urban Master Plan (2020e2040), which was formulated by urban development policy to coordinate the conflicts between rapid urbanization and ecological protection. This study provides a characteristic example of how to establish GI networks based on ES evaluations and provides a strong reference for land-use and environmental planning in other developing countries and regions that are exposed to severe ecological deterioration.

Representing large proportions of green area in highly modified landscapes, residential gardens are often seen as local habitats that can contribute to larger networks of suitable environments at the landscape scale. We investigated the impact of the landscape context on butterfly communities observed in residential gardens, taking into account garden characteristics, land-use types and presence of linear features in the surrounding landscape. We examined how species traits affected butterflies' response to landscape context and habitat quality. We performed a cross-scale study, based on citizen science data documenting butterfly species composition and abundance in 920 gardens across France. We examined the effect of garden quality, the area of different land-use types and the length of linear elements measured at three scales within the surrounding landscape. Species were grouped according to their habitat preference and mobility. Urbanization negatively affected total species richness and the abundance of butterfly in each group. This was related to declining habitat quality and reduced area of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. The magnitude of this effect, however, was negatively correlated with mobility, a trait related to habitat preference. The spatial scale at which landscape context best explained variation in butterfly abundance changed with species' habitat preference. This study highlights the importance of preserving high quality habitats in altered landscapes and considering species' mobility and habitat preference when assessing the impact of landscapes on butterfly communities.",10.1007/s10980-015-0299-9,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-doi-10_1007-S10980-015-0299-9; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-015-0299-9,Landscape Ecology,5,10.1007/s10980-015-0299-9,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.springer-doi-10_1007-S10980-015-0299-9; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-015-0299-9

The clearings could potentially promote flowering species associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m x 5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can enhance plant biodiversity including richness of insect-pollinated species and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural grasslands.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.07.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204617301792,Landscape and Urban Planning,4,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.07.017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204617301792

In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99% of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (F-ST and D-c) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P < 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs.

Urbanisation is one of the main land-use changes behind global insect collapse. Despite that previous studies have described the negative effects of urbanisation on insect communities, so far there is no synthesis that considers multiple urban drivers, their combined effects, and the role of species traits altogether. 2. Here we developed an integrative framework of the underlying mechanisms behind terrestrial insect species loss in cities by exploring five leading drivers: impervious surfaces, habitat fragmentation, urban heat island, pollution, and exotic plants. For each driver, we identified the main direct and indirect (mediated through species interactions or changes in resources) effects on insect populations and communities, emphasising the role of species traits as moderators of such effects. 3. Body size, mobility, and oviposition/nesting requirements were the traits that frequently defined insect vulnerability to urban drivers. Urban heat island and pollution deserve further research from a community-level approach. Direct effects of drivers dominated the literature, while most indirect paths were mediated by changes in resources rather than species interactions. 4. In conclusion, our review showed the challenges of recognising particular effects and mechanisms for each urban driver and their combined effects. By doing so, we intended to encourage researchers to address some of the gaps we noticed in order to fully understand how urbanisation is affecting insect communities.

Taxon Carabid beetles and wild bees. Methods We use a large species occurrence and trait dataset with a high spatial resolution to assess the filtering effect of a medium-sized city on a regional pool of potential colonists. We then assess the filtering from the urban pool to five widely distributed types of urban green spaces. Results We found that our model city selects for functionally similar but taxonomically diverse bee and carabid beetle species from the regional species pool. Within the city, community assembly processes vary among green space types and taxa resulting in important changes in community taxonomic and functional composition. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that urban community assembly is a multi-scale process dominated by the strong environmental filtering from a regional to an urban species pool. This leads to the selection of species pre-adapted to urban conditions. Spatial habitat heterogeneity within and among UGS types can maintain an important taxonomic diversity within cities.

Shenzhen, as a highly urbanized area in China, is facing the dual pressures of urban development and ecological conservation. The ecological corridors in Shenzhen are being constantly eroded by urban expansion, resulting in an urgent need to carry out sensitivity evaluations and ecological land management studies. By identifying the spatial range of planned ecological corridors in Shenzhen, we develop a GIS-based ecological sensitivity evaluation model from the perspectives of soil environment, habitat conditions, geological hazards, and human disturbance. Management strategies are proposed with regard to macroscopic protection guidance and microscopic land-use control. The results show that there is little difference in the sensitivity grade of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. With regard to spatial distribution, the sensitivity level is high in the north and low in the south, with moderately sensitive corridors being the dominant type. Meanwhile, we design the land-use control program by taking into account the present management and new land demand and provide the path for implementing the withdrawal, reservation, occupation, and avoidance polices. The results of the sensitivity evaluation objectively reflect the eco-environmental condition of ecological corridors in Shenzhen.

Understanding movement patterns is crucial for the effective conservation of amphibian populations isolated by urban development. Here, we conducted a capture-recapture study over 6 years in a population of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) inhabiting a 7.3-ha patch of forest and disturbed land-use types in an urbanised catchment north-west of Budapest, Hungary. We investigated relationships between movement distances and environmental, spatial and demographic parameters in order to understand how this species is able to persist in a relatively small and isolated habitat patch. We found that most movement was aggregated around a permanent stream and that movement distances were generally <= 200 m, with maximum distances of 925 and 707 m for males and females, respectively. Movement patterns within the population were best modelled using a negative exponential function characterised by infrequent long-distance movement. Males had substantially larger home range sizes than females and were predicted to have larger movement distances. Mean movement distances were predicted to be larger in disturbed areas in the upper stream catchment which included residential areas, compared with smaller movements in more natural forest near the stream. There was a positive relationship between mean movement distance and body condition. Our results suggest that this local population persists in a relatively small habitat patch because it provides a stable breeding site and suitable foraging and shelter microhabitats.

Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on allocating green spaces within urban settings and expand the formal green spaces.

An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (gamma-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (alpha-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in alpha-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the alpha-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the alpha-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas.

Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.05.010,NA,Landscape and Urban Planning,3,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.05.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066961999&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2019.05.010&partnerID=40&md5=778c6d1652c5039a43b5cf1e4405cbd0

However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.",10.3389/fevo.2022.779005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128435012&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2022.779005&partnerID=40&md5=5ab1c125cc2574e2014b273f9bfa530b,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2,10.3389/fevo.2022.779005,NA

How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution.

Animal Movement Data Alter Conservation Priorities,American Midland Naturalist,American Midland Naturalist,174,105,"As natural habitats become fragmented by human activities, animals must increasingly move through human-dominated systems, particularly agricultural landscapes. Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.",10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105,https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-174/issue-1/0003-0031-174.1.105/Can-Orchards-Help-Connect-Mediterranean-Ecosystems-Animal-Movement-Data-Alter/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105.short; https://pubs-test.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155184; https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0ps3x1b0; https://core.ac.uk/display/30774987; https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155184; https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-174/issue-1/0003-0031-174.1.105/Can-Orchards-Help-Connect-Mediterranean-Ecosystems-Animal-Movement-Data-Alter/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105.pdf; https://escholarship.org/content/qt0ps3x1b0/qt0ps3x1b0.pdf?t=nyj0ri; https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105; https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0ps3x1b0.pdf,American Midland Naturalist,6,10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105,https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-174/issue-1/0003-0031-174.1.105/Can-Orchards-Help-Connect-Mediterranean-Ecosystems-Animal-Movement-Data-Alter/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105.short; https://pubs-test.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155184; https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0ps3x1b0; https://core.ac.uk/display/30774987; https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155184; https://bioone.org/journals/The-American-Midland-Naturalist/volume-174/issue-1/0003-0031-174.1.105/Can-Orchards-Help-Connect-Mediterranean-Ecosystems-Animal-Movement-Data-Alter/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105.pdf; https://escholarship.org/content/qt0ps3x1b0/qt0ps3x1b0.pdf?t=nyj0ri; https://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1674/0003-0031-174.1.105; https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0ps3x1b0.pdf

Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters.

We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands.

However, outside of full protection of undeveloped wildlife corridors, conservation planners have limited tools to identify the appropriate level of densification such that landscape permeability for wildlife is maintained. Here we sought to determine the development characteristics that contribute to movement potential in an exurban landscape for a large carnivore, the puma. We first fit a piecewise step-selection function from movement paths from 28 male pumas to identify threshold levels of development that produce barriers to movement. We then applied this threshold to projected housing densities of existing parcels under a full General Plan buildout scenario in Santa Cruz County to illustrate how parcels at risk of increasing above the puma movement threshold can be identified. Finally, we tested the relative importance of characteristics associated with parcels and the surrounding area on relative puma movement. We found that pumas exhibit avoidance of housing density that saturates at a threshold, and that puma utilization of parcels at risk of densification above this threshold is predicted by parcel area and the housing density and area of surrounding parcels. Our work suggests that maintaining permeability in developing landscapes is likely contingent on preventing densification and parcel subdivision in exurban areas.

From January 2018 to December 2020, 137927 birds representing 206 species were recorded. The results indicated that the number of species and individuals of birds were higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in each season. The number of species and individuals was also higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in different functional groups according to bird food type, residential type, and ecological type. The number of species shared by the two types of parks was 120. The unique birds' species number in hillside and riverside parks were 67 and 19, respectively. Bird diversity in terms of richness and Shannon index was higher significantly in hillside parks than in riverside parks in summer. Principal component analysis of environmental traits of 18 parks showed that plant traits in parks have relatively high and positive contribution. Correlation analysis indicated that bird diversity was positively affected by water area, the highest altitude, habitats diversity and tree evenness in park, while negatively regulated by building coverage around each park. The top 20 most abundant bird species accounted for 87.5% of the total birds in the study period. Nycticorax nycticorax, Urocissa erythroryncha and Podiceps ruficollis were observed more frequently in hillside parks, while Pycnonotus aurigaster, Passer montanus, Acridotheres cristatellus were observed more frequently in riverside parks.

Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types.

This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season.

We studied reptile and amphibian species diversity and abundance in a highly fragmented landscape adjacent to the second largest metropolitan area in the United States. Habitat patches in our study area were made up of remnant native vegetation surrounded by roads, housing, and other urban development. Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as ""microreserves.'' In addition, one lizard species was found to be significantly more abundant in the smaller patches. To determine if abundance changed over time, we compared capture rates for four common lizards at the same sites ten years later. For three of the four species, abundance decreased over that period, specifically in the small patches.

Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species.

Against this background we here investigate the factors affecting pond occupancy in the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea L.) within an urban landscape, being located in north-eastern Germany where the species is still fairly common. Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.",10.1007/s11284-014-1238-y,NA; html; html; html; unknown; html,Ecological Research,23,10.1007/s11284-014-1238-y,NA; html; html; html; unknown; html

We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments. Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m. Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

In this paper, we asked whether local (area of forest patches) and landscape (amount of suitable habitat surrounding of focal patches) factors affect the breeding success of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Tokyo, Central Japan. The breeding success of raccoon dogs is easy to judge as adults travel with pups during the breeding season. We selected 21 forest patches (3.3-797.8 ha) as study sites. In each forest patch, we used infrared-triggered cameras for a total of 60 camera days per site. We inspected each photo to determine whether it was of an adult or a pup. Although we found adult raccoon dogs in all 21 forest patches, pups were found only in 13 patches. To estimate probability of occurrence and detection for raccoon in 21 forest fragments, we used single season site occupancy models in PRESENCE program. Model selection based on AIC and model averaging showed that the occupancy probability of pups was positively affected by patch area. This result suggests that large forests improve breeding success of raccoon dogs. A major reason for the low habitat value of small, isolated patches may be the low availability of food sources and the high risk of being killed on the roads in such areas.

We present here for the first time a synthesis of the state of knowledge of ground beetle communities from green roofs in Switzerland. We describe 91 ground beetles species (19,428 individuals) and highlight patterns of species occurrence and composition across green roofs and cities. Most of the roofs host ground beetle communities dominated by five common mobile species with quite diversified ecological requirements. In addition, we observed nine species (10% of all species collected) that are conservation concerns in Switzerland and Central Europe as well as numerous stenotopic species (from grasslands and pioneer vegetation). This indicates that, besides sustaining local populations of common species, green roofs can also offer suitable ecological conditions of high conservation interest.

However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird. The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations. Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry. Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.",10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105327,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102528056&doi=10.1016%2fj.prevetmed.2021.105327&partnerID=40&md5=01c815472f71245adc39e5a7a03efd1b,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,5,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105327,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102528056&doi=10.1016%2fj.prevetmed.2021.105327&partnerID=40&md5=01c815472f71245adc39e5a7a03efd1b

When this heterogeneity imposes variable costs of moving across the landscape, populations can be structured according to a pattern of ""isolation by resistance"" (IBR). At the same time, divergent local environmental filters can limit gene flow, creating an alternative pattern of ""isolation by environment"" (IBE). Here, we evaluate IBR and IBE in the insect-pollinated, biennial plant Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae) across serpentine grasslands in the fragmented landscape of SE Pennsylvania, USA using similar to 4500 neutral SNP loci. Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than ""natural"" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales. While cropland presents a substantially lower barrier than urban development, cumulative human land use surrounding populations predicts within-population genetic diversity and inbreeding in S. angularis. Our results emphasize the role of forest buffers and corridors in facilitating gene flow between serpentine grassland patches and averting local extinction of plant populations.",10.1111/mec.15753,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245827; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7262916; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.15753,Molecular Ecology,4,10.1111/mec.15753,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245827; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7262916; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.15753

The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal.

However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified.

Urban ecosystems can host richer wild bee communities than highly intensified agricultural areas, specifically in resource-rich urban green spaces such as allotments and family gardens. At the same time, urban beekeeping has boomed in many European cities, raising concerns that the fast addition of a large number of managed bees could deplete the existing floral resources, triggering competition between wild bees and honeybees. Here, we studied the interplay between resource availability and the number of honeybees at local and landscape scales and how this relationship influences wild bee diversity. We collected wild bees and honeybees in a pollination experiment using four standardized plant species with distinct floral morphologies. We performed the experiment in 23 urban gardens in the city of Zurich (Switzerland), distributed along gradients of urban and local management intensity, and measured functional traits related to resource use. At each site, we quantified the feeding niche partitioning (calculated as the average distance in the multidimensional trait space) between the wild bee community and the honeybee population. Using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we tested direct and indirect effects of resource availability, urban beekeeping, and wild bees on the community feeding niche partitioning. We found an increase in feeding niche partitioning with increasing wild bee species richness. Moreover, feeding niche partitioning tended to increase in experimental sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale, which had lower abundances of honeybees. However, beekeeping intensity at the local and landscape scales did not directly influence community feeding niche partitioning or wild bee species richness. In addition, wild bee species richness was positively influenced by local resource availability, whereas local honeybee abundance was positively affected by landscape resource availability. Overall, these results suggest that direct competition for resources was not a main driver of the wild bee community. Due to the key role of resource availability in maintaining a diverse bee community, our study encourages cities to monitor floral resources to better manage urban beekeeping and help support urban pollinators.",10.1002/eap.2727,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2727,Ecological Applications,5,10.1002/eap.2727,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2727

We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts.

The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. Tn general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation, In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation. A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural). Recommendations are made to appraise opportunities further at the regional level, conduct ecological corridor research at the landscape scale, and develop a greenway prototype at a specific community site.",10.1016/0169-2046(94)02021-7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169204694020217,Landscape and Urban Planning,3,10.1016/0169-2046(94)02021-7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169204694020217

Such information is, however, absent in Lubumbashi, the second metropolis of the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite its high demographic growth rate and an unplanned spatial urban growth. This study was designed to characterize the spatial pattern of green spaces and the extent of changes driven by the urbanization along the urban-rural gradient using a combination of landscape metrics and floristic plots. Our results revealed that the number of patches was directly proportional to the degree of urbanization of the city, whereas the area of the green spaces and the index of the largest patch showed an inverse relationship with the urbanization degree. Urban green spaces were dominated by attached and roadside spaces that are more equipped and present a higher occurrence of cultivated plants. By contrast, peri-urban green spaces were characterized by buffer zones, fields, abandoned areas, and informal spaces, with an elevated proportion of invasive species and natural vegetation. Moreover, it was found that the number of exotic species increased with the degree of urbanization, reaching values considered a threat to the indigenous flora. The current results underline the need for urgent measures oriented both toward increasing the spatial connectivity between green spaces (e.g., by creating new green spaces planted with indigenous species) while reducing the spread of invasive species in the city.",10.1177/1940082918771325,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940082918771325; https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/228885; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1940082918771325; https://bioone.org/journals/Tropical-Conservation-Science/volume-11/issue-1/1940082918771325/Changes-in-the-Spatial-Pattern-and-Ecological-Functionalities-of-Green/10.1177/1940082918771325.full; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940082918771325,Tropical Conservation Science,7,10.1177/1940082918771325,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940082918771325; https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/228885; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1940082918771325; https://bioone.org/journals/Tropical-Conservation-Science/volume-11/issue-1/1940082918771325/Changes-in-the-Spatial-Pattern-and-Ecological-Functionalities-of-Green/10.1177/1940082918771325.full; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940082918771325

It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (F-ST=0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations.

Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods.",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106572,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124418821&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2022.106572&partnerID=40&md5=7d0a5f0e5863682eb59f5635ccccf2f4,Ecological Engineering,4,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106572,NA

Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments. In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation.

The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou's UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai-Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.",10.3390/su141912365,NA,Sustainability,2,10.3390/su141912365,NA

An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration.

The proportion of multistemmed plants differs among land uses: this value was greater in AGR than in the FOR and URB categories. This proportion also differed among the four hydrographic regions. The land use type FOR presented the highest alpha and beta diversity, with a high number of native species occurring only in areas defined by this land use. The results indicate that the category FOR plays an important role in the conservation of regional flora and is a possible source of germplasm for restoration programs in sites degraded by human disturbance. This study shows how anthropogenic activities affect riparian vegetation and highlights the importance of further study of this ecosystem to apply sustainable management strategies that are compatible with its conservation.",10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z; https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z,Plant Ecology,3,10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z; https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11258-014-0297-z

Senecio inaequidens DC is one of the Europe's fastest plant invaders and is suspected to use railway corridors to expand. In France, the species has first been observed in the city of Paris in the late 1990's and today it is present throughout the region. In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied. To our knowledge, studies on invasive allotetraploid plants where data were kept in the tetraploid format are still scarce. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line. Results also showed no genetic bottleneck between Parisian populations and the historically introduced population located in South of France. Our study thus revealed the role of railways as a corridor among S. inaequidens populations within central Paris.

The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.",10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,Urban Ecosystems,4,10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-016-0564-y

Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs. 2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary. 3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it. 4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate. 5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency. 6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. They emphasize the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity on a time-scale that accommodates slow-migrating species such as forest herbs.",10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x/full; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x,Journal of Ecology,2,10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x; https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x/full; https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00908.x

Drawing on a sample of 199 nature-based solutions across Europe, we identify how cities work with nature-based solutions to conserve nature, restore nature, and to find ways to thrive through harnessing nature's contribution to people. Our findings show that cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature-based solutions, and often adopt specific and quantifiable targets to guide their actions. Yet there is significant variation in the ways in which biodiversity goals and interventions are being pursued. Where biodiversity goals and actions are included in nature-based solutions, they are mainly ecosystem-based - focusing on the protection, restoration or enhancement of the integrity, functionality, and connectivity of habitats and ecosystems - with fewer focused on specific species, and very few projects concerned with genetic diversity. Although it is often assumed that urban action towards biodiversity goals will be undertaken through local planning processes, our analysis shows that European cities are taking project-based actions for biodiversity through a set of explicit, quantitative and measurable targets, which are tailored to the specific conditions of urban settings. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that if cities are to achieve ambitious goals for biodiversity over the next decade, new international frameworks being developed for the post-2020 period should include targets that acknowledge the way in which biodiversity is governed in cities and the contribution that cities make to conserve, restore and thrive with nature to guide urban action.",10.1016/j.envsci.2020.04.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084547621&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2020.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=1a49553a27c56725976dae5278ad2d2e,Environmental Science and Policy,2,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.04.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084547621&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2020.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=1a49553a27c56725976dae5278ad2d2e

Also, it has been proved that urban flora differs from its surroundings, and at the same time reflects its richness. Our study focused on urban flora, structure and similarities, and the possible correlation with the urban attributes. Therefore, we selected 11 cities in Southeast Europe, which differ in the development of transportation networks (roads, rails and inland waterways) and population size. Next, we compared two sets of data (structure of urban flora and urban attributes) to define the correlation patterns. Analyzed urban floras were primarily distinguished by a total number of species, number of unique species and neophytes. Belgrade is a city with the highest urbanization level, the most species and the highest number of unique species and neophytes as well. Kosovska Mitrovica, Grocka and Pozarevac stand out by floristic richness. These cities have a high number of species, yet a small proportion of neophytes. Other cities are characterized by similar floristic structure, with a relatively similar proportion of neophytes and approximately similar number of unique species in relation to the total number. It can be concluded that other factors beside the chosen urban attributes have additional effects on floristic structure, except for the factor - the presence of neophytes.

The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai.

These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa.

The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.",10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019858331&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-017-9992-0&partnerID=40&md5=8097597afb461bfec8a361246ebd0160,Journal of Insect Conservation,3,10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019858331&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-017-9992-0&partnerID=40&md5=8097597afb461bfec8a361246ebd0160

The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands.

Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected. 4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable. 5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism.

During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.",10.1016/0169-2046(93)90109-Q,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027884327&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2893%2990109-Q&partnerID=40&md5=a5ce01637599a703edd86a5bd6616c86,Landscape and Urban Planning,1,10.1016/0169-2046(93)90109-Q,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027884327&doi=10.1016%2f0169-2046%2893%2990109-Q&partnerID=40&md5=a5ce01637599a703edd86a5bd6616c86

We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.",10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/17982/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-020-00978-4.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/241802809/vegetated-roofs-in-boreal-climate-support-mobile-open-habitat-arthropods-with,Urban Ecosystems,8,10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/17982/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-020-00978-4; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11252-020-00978-4.pdf; https://paperity.org/p/241802809/vegetated-roofs-in-boreal-climate-support-mobile-open-habitat-arthropods-with

Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment. Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units. In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality. The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use.

The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.",10.1071/WR19076,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095133822&doi=10.1071%2fWR19076&partnerID=40&md5=c5ffcb5d9d6208e09b88b83a02575933,Wildlife Research,9,10.1071/WR19076,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095133822&doi=10.1071%2fWR19076&partnerID=40&md5=c5ffcb5d9d6208e09b88b83a02575933

Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.",10.1603/022.038.0509,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/biosci_pubs/961/; https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/38/5/1411/407854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825296; https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.short; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103029900.html; http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/5/1411; https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103029900; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19825296,Environmental Entomology,4,10.1603/022.038.0509,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/biosci_pubs/961/; https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/38/5/1411/407854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19825296; https://bioone.org/journals/environmental-entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.short; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103029900.html; http://ee.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/5/1411; https://bioone.org/journals/Environmental-Entomology/volume-38/issue-5/022.038.0509/Habitat-Specific-Movement-and-Edge-Mediated-Behavior-of-the-Saproxylic/10.1603/022.038.0509.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103029900; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19825296

They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities.

Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix. We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision. We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance. When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit. Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.",10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z; https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/128395/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6561088; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z/figures/1; https://paperity.org/p/86300517/linking-ecosystem-services-urban-form-and-green-space-configuration-using-multivariate; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31258244; https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/13072; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/021c872b-cea6-380e-9ae8-33c1b4b8d9d7/; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5921208; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-018-0618-z.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z/fulltext.html,Landscape Ecology,3,10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z; https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/128395/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6561088; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z/figures/1; https://paperity.org/p/86300517/linking-ecosystem-services-urban-form-and-green-space-configuration-using-multivariate; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31258244; https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/13072; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/021c872b-cea6-380e-9ae8-33c1b4b8d9d7/; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5921208; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-018-0618-z.pdf; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-018-0618-z/fulltext.html

We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway.

Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies. Pairwise tests of year by year comparisons revealed significant shifts in allelic frequencies between years one and two and between one and three, but not between years two and three. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of small vertebrates to stochastic changes in the allelic composition of populations in a fragmented landscape, and can be useful for the development of biodiversity management in an increasingly fragmented habitat mosaic.",10.1080/21564574.2013.834852,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacqueline_Bishop/publication/263609548_Temporal_changes_in_allelic_variation_among_Cape_Dwarf_Chameleons_Bradypodion_pumilum_inhabiting_a_transformed_semi-urban_wetland/links/556705c308aeab77721e0598.pdf; https://www.ent.uga.edu/bees/documents/KatzTolletBishop-Temporalchangesinallelicvariation.pdf; https://www.caes.uga.edu/departments/ent/bees/documents/KatzTolletBishop-Temporalchangesinallelicvariation.pdf; https://journals.co.za/content/ajherp/63/1/EJC150802; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21564574.2013.834852,African Journal of Herpetology,3,10.1080/21564574.2013.834852,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacqueline_Bishop/publication/263609548_Temporal_changes_in_allelic_variation_among_Cape_Dwarf_Chameleons_Bradypodion_pumilum_inhabiting_a_transformed_semi-urban_wetland/links/556705c308aeab77721e0598.pdf; https://www.ent.uga.edu/bees/documents/KatzTolletBishop-Temporalchangesinallelicvariation.pdf; https://www.caes.uga.edu/departments/ent/bees/documents/KatzTolletBishop-Temporalchangesinallelicvariation.pdf; https://journals.co.za/content/ajherp/63/1/EJC150802; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21564574.2013.834852

Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively).

However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods.

Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations. The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei. Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment. This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.",10.1002/aqc.3324,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082051137&doi=10.1002%2faqc.3324&partnerID=40&md5=626030bf8b7f6c7f4129c123c977ebc7,Aquatic Conservation-Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,4,10.1002/aqc.3324,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082051137&doi=10.1002%2faqc.3324&partnerID=40&md5=626030bf8b7f6c7f4129c123c977ebc7

Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningixa (CBYN) as a case study, we quantified five critical ESs (one provision service of crop production, three regulating services of carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and sand fixation, and one cultural service of recreational opportunity) in 1989-2019 through CASA model, InVEST model and empirical equations. Then we calculated landscape pattern metrics at landscape and class level through Fragstats 4.3 across multiple scales and quantified their impacts on each ES and ES trade-offs through random forest analysis, self-organizing mapping analysis and multivariable regression tree. The results suggested that 3 km is more suitable for analyzing the impacts of landscape pattern on ESs in the CBYN. The nonlinear relations between landscape pattern metrics and each ES were fitted with adjusted R2 ranging from 0.26 to 0.51, indicating the significant but limited impacts of landscape pattern on ESs. Specially, landscape-level metrics of CONTAG, SHDI and FRACMN have higher impacts on ESs than class-level ones. Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation. Sand fixation has synergy relations with the former three ESs, which would be altered in situations with higher or lower diversity.

In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.",10.1002/ece3.2229,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977600443&doi=10.1002%2fece3.2229&partnerID=40&md5=99ddd4e5e8cb00450c5a8a96e30ed663,Ecology and Evolution,3,10.1002/ece3.2229,https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/landscape-genetics-of-the-nonnative-red-fox-of-california; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2229; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27547312; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4979706/; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4979706

Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among ""Greater Wildland Ecosystems."" Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales.

It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions.

In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1-7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103860,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086459640&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2020.103860&partnerID=40&md5=2d91d0ce0145d92bd1f31f01c541d08f,Landscape and Urban Planning,4,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103860,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086459640&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2020.103860&partnerID=40&md5=2d91d0ce0145d92bd1f31f01c541d08f

In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves.

The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.",NA,NA,2018 7th International Conference On Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics),8,10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476082,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055872244&doi=10.1109%2fAgro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476082&partnerID=40&md5=dca1ff128ac3b47c2b731a10b92f6ce2

Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species.

B. xylophilus is spread in Asia by vector beetles of Monochamus alternatus, which has long no effective control method. Understanding of landscape effects on the dispersal and outbreaks of forest pests is crucial to establishing effective ecological control strategies. Here, we analyzed the samples of M. alternatus collected in a fine-scale in order to estimate the effects of landscape types on the genetic structure and dispersal of M. alternatus. The landscapes included the geographical scales, forest types and land uses. The individuals of M. alternatus were genotyped by using whole-genome resequencing. Population genetic structures were clearly differentiated at the range of 250 kms, suggesting the intermediate scale is an effective barrier against natural dispersal of M. alternatus. We used the least-cost distances, least-cost transect analysis, and distance-based redundancy analysis to estimate the effects of forest types and land uses within the fine scales. The results showed that the gene flow and genetic diversity were positively correlated with host and mixed forests, whereas negatively with non-host forests. Among land-use landscapes, the roads had the positive effect on gene flow and genetic diversity but farmland and urban uses had negative effects. This highlights that human-mediated transport via roads was likely to be the main factor leading to the long-distance invasion of M. alternatus, whereas non-host landscapes could suppress the spread of this species. These findings may be useful to control the PWD dispersed by M. alternatus. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120682,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143486871&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2022.120682&partnerID=40&md5=bc21351862810ce963e32253875b4e3c,Forest Ecology and Management,10,10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120682,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143486871&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2022.120682&partnerID=40&md5=bc21351862810ce963e32253875b4e3c

Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeat-visit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (xˆ = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (xˆ = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (xˆ = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (xˆ = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (xˆ = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (xˆ = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas. © 2022",10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02200,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132780665&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02200&partnerID=40&md5=595f1bba9409123f656b01d0ad42b41f,Global Ecology and Conservation,2,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02200,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132780665&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02200&partnerID=40&md5=595f1bba9409123f656b01d0ad42b41f

In this context, building ecological networks to increase habitat connectivity in urban scale is vitally important for effective conservation. Because the data of other species is inaccessible, taking the observed bird population as focal species and to build ecological networks provides us a novel idea for protecting local biodiversity. This paper takes Beijing plain as study area to build a systematic ecological network. Based on the data of spatial distribution of typical 86 kinds of bird that are in the list of threatened species, we explore the potential habitats as source patches under the support of Maxent model. Then we utilize the land use data to create resistance surface which symbolizes the degree of difficulty of species′ passing through among habitats, by means of that we integrate the spatial data with the minimum cumulative resistance model, and a classified ecological network is constructed. The result shows that wetlands and public gardens are the dominant habitats, which represent 81% natural areas in Beijing plain. The identified habitat sources are classified two types according to the linear relation of species richness and the extent of habitats, and the number of primary and the secondary habitats are 58 and 146, respectively. Similarly, the modelled ecological corridors are also classified into the primary and secondary types. The former represents the corridors among primary habitats, and the latter are corridors that connects the primary habitats with the secondary habitats. Totally, the number of corridors is 948 and the length is 3760 kilometers. Moreover, 12 essentially ecological nodes are selected by kernel density analysis, and 6 key corridors are confirmed according to their ecological attributes. These nodes and corridors are important ecological infrastructures in biodiversity conservation on Beijing plain. In conclusion, building up 948 corridors are believed to be beneficial for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, the ecological network is also an optional solution and reference for local decision makers to draw up scientifically and rationally a spatial optimized planning for human-nature harmonious Beijing. © 2022 Science Press.

This study draws attention to the spatial and temporal characteristics of landscape ecological risk and constructs an ecological security pattern of Yinchuan City in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, by employing land use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020; analyzing the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of landscape ecological risk based on landscape ecological risk assessment; and studying the ecological risk evolution rule of different land use. This study proposes the ecological security pattern and ecological security protection strategies using the landscape ecological risk index (ERI) and the minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Meanwhile, in order to reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, the paper used core ecological sources which had areas greater than 10 km2 and were mainly distributed in natural protected areas such as Helan Mountain and Baijitan National Nature Reserve. It chose six resistance factors, including landscape ERI, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from road, and distance from water to calculate the resistance value. Based on ecological sources and resistance, the minimal cumulative resistance value was obtained by MCR and the ecological corridors and ecological nodes were identified preliminarily. Finally, the preliminary ecological security pattern was optimized, combined with land use map of 2020 and the MCR value, and the ecological security strategies were proposed. The results show that: (1) Landscape ecological risk in Yinchuan City shows the distribution characteristics, are high in which the middle and north but low in the south is low. The average ERIs of 2000, 2010, and 2020 are 0.2155, 0.2145, and 0.2130, respectively, which indicates an overall downward trend in the landscape ecological risk has appeared in the past 20 years and an ecological risk level moving from high to low. (2) Twenty-two ecological corridors and 52 ecological nodes are identified.

River ecological corridor plays an important role in the protection of urban bird habitats. However, the diversity of different ecological community of birds is influenced by environmental factors at multiple scales. The habitat pattern optimization and habitat construction of birds in urban ecological corridors for specific ecological community need the support of theoretical research urgently. Based on the analysis of bird species composition in Beijing Wenyu River ecological corridor in spring, we comprehensively analyzed the effects of environmental factors on bird species composition of different ecological communities at three scales of landscape pattern, habitat patch and micro-habitat, in order to understand the impact of environmental factors on bird habitat selection, and provide reference for bird diversity protection and habitat construction of urban river ecological corridors. [Method] In the spring of 2019, we conducted a field survey of bird species composition and plant community structure in the Wenyu River ecological corridor. Landscape pattern analysis was conducted after visual interpretation of the habitats in the corridor. Redundant analysis (RDA) was used to analyze the correlation between bird species composition and multi-scale environmental factors. [Result] The pattern characteristics within 50−200 m had the highest interpretation for the overall composition of birds. The composition of songbirds was mainly related to the Pielou index of trees in the community, the area of water and wetland within a small range, and some indexes of grassland and deciduous forest within a large range. The composition of terrestrial bird was mainly related to cropland and shrub. The composition of swimming birds and wading birds had a strong correlation with water body area and wetland area within a small range. The composition of raptorial birds was associated with wetland waters. In same ecological community, the composition of different reside pattern birds had different correlations with environmental factors. Most bird abundance was positively correlated with wetland area, wetland largest patch index and wetland cohesion index within 100 m, and waterbody splitting index within 2 000 m. [Conclusion] The relationship between birds of different ecological communities and various environmental factors is diverse, but the indices of water body and wetland have influence on birds of all ecological communities in the river ecological corridor. In the future construction of urban ecological corridors, we suggest to consider the habitat preferences of different bird communities, pay attention to the optimization of the habitat pattern of wetland water in corridors, and carry out the construction and protection of bird habitats for targeted species. © 2022 Beijing Forestry University.

In this study, the central urban area of a typical multi-mountainous city (Guiyang, China) was taken as research area. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) characteristic indicators system of USMS was constructed. The InVEST model was used to evaluate the HQ in the study area, and the spatial pattern characteristics of USMS and HQ in the multi-mountainous city were analyzed. Finally, the response relationship of HQ to USMS was revealed through Pearson correlation analysis and curve fitting. The results showed that: (1) The average level of HQ in the study area is low and the spatial aggregation effect is obvious; the spatial distribution difference between the high value area and the low value area is significant; the high value area is mainly distributed in the area where the large area of urban green space (UGS) and the urban remnant mountains (URMs) are located, while the low value area is mainly distributed in the high-intensity urban construction area. (2)The URMs have a significant impact on the USMS within the city, the intelligibility(I), spatial permeability, spatial aggregation degree, and spatial traffic attraction potential were poor; the buffer zone within 4 km of the urban center is the core area of urban development, and the buffer zone within 15 km is the rapid urban development area. (3)Among the USMS indicators, Choice(C) was significantly positively correlated with the HQ, while the Connectivity(Con), I, Average height(AVH), and Otherness(O) were significantly negatively correlated with the HQ. (4)Stepwise regression results showed that USMS could explain the difference of HQ in the study area well, and the values of fitting coefficient R2 were 0.975, 0.837 and 0.945 in 2008, 2013 and 2018, respectively.

Time for action,Global Ecology and Conservation,Global Ecology and Conservation,39,e02295,"European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced ca. 40 years ago to South America, where they naturalized to central and northern Argentina, now reaching some neighboring countries. While Patagonia (southern Argentina and Chile) has remained free of European starlings (ES) in the past, they are now present along its northern boundary. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the factors explaining this recent invasion, and 2) predict how starlings might expand across southernmost America based on niche modeling using landform, land cover, and climatic variables representing conditions that may limit ES. Based on records from community science, informants, and our own observations, we conclude that two parallel processes generated new population nodes in northern Patagonia: 1) a southwards expansion from their core areas near the Atlantic coast (generating an incipient population node in NE Patagonia), and 2) birds released or escaped from captivity (generating an isolated population node in north-central Patagonia). Community science data was most useful from 2018 onwards, while data from informants was key to understand previous events (e.g., first ES confiscated from illegal trade in 2008; first free ranging ES seen in 2014). The most parsimonious model confirmed our prediction that human transformed lands in several portions within the target area are suitable for ES establishment, both in Chile and Argentina. Null suitability was modeled for the lands in southernmost Patagonia (all cover types). Desert lands (Patagonian steppe, Monte Desert, High Andes) that skirt the Andean temperate forests on the north, and most of the Andean forests, turned out to be unsuitable (especially with increasing latitude). Conversely, most of coastal Argentine Patagonia and the human-transformed lands of south-central Chile emerged as moderately suitable habitat for ES. Because the riverine areas under current ES colonization in northern Patagonia are fovourable for ES (i.e., agricultural and urban lands with abundant nesting sites), without control actions, this species might soon spread over ca. 5000 km2 around the Colorado and Negro rivers, affecting their agricultural industry. These rivers, which run west-east through desert lands unsuitable for ES, now represent corridors into south-Andean ecosystems, as they are surrounded by treed land (willows and poplars introduced from Europe) not originally available, connecting formerly separate ecoregions. In case ES manage to reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, they might cross to Chile through low elevation passes (<1000 masl) available south of ca. 38°S. The valleys of south-central Chile are both suitable habitat for ES and valuable productive lands that may be threatened by the invasion. We present management suggestions, and advocate for the development of a bi-national strategy to retard, prevent and alleviate the far-reaching impacts ES may exert on America's southernmost ecosystems and resources. © 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139013361&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02295&partnerID=40&md5=a0c6b3e5755e3e297f3e5dbfb1b5c3c4,Global Ecology and Conservation,5,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02295,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139013361&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2022.e02295&partnerID=40&md5=a0c6b3e5755e3e297f3e5dbfb1b5c3c4

The results showed that: 1) As one of the effective methods to extract urban built-up area, the statistical data comparison method had high accuracy in our study area, and the error rate was within 6.7%. 2) The urban land formed a discontinuous spatial pattern of “几” around the Hexi Corridor and the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and had three different distribution patterns: point, line and plane. 3) The annual average rate and dynamic degree of urban expansion showed an upward trend, and the rate of urban expansion during 2010—2013 (4.53 km2 / a) was twice as high as that during 2006—2010. 4) Except for Jiuquan, Haixi, Baiyin, Tianshui, Shizuishan and Lanzhou, the compactness index of other urban build-up areas was relatively high. 5) In the first stage (2002—2006) and the second stage (2006—2010), the center of gravity shifted northward, and in the third stage (2010—2013), the center of gravity shifted southward. 6) The total NDVI of urban built-up area increased with the increase of built-up area. 7) The vegetation in urban built-up areas showed a positive trend on the whole. From the perspective of the mean NDVI, the vegetation condition got worse from 2002 to 2006, and improved from 2006 to 2013. Moreover, the mean NDVI distribution showed obvious spatial differences, and the central and western regions were generally smaller than the eastern ones. From the perspective of the interannual variation rate and percentage of NDVI, the built-up area of each city was larger than the peripheral background area. 8) The vegetation status in urban built-up areas was generally worse than that in background areas, and the NDVI ratio and its variation in nearly 4/ 7 urban built-up areas showed a downward trend from 2002 to 2013. 9) Vegetation stability in urban built-up areas was poor, and the variation coefficients of more than half of the cities increased to varying degrees in the past 12 years. © 2022 Science Press.

We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Intertransect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health. © 2022.

Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Québec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples from a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12 years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12 years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]).

Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunction-ality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connec-tivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be sup-ported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Not-withstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requal-ification of transitional urban–rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban–rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native plant populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11252-022-01278-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138376081&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01278-9&partnerID=40&md5=1042b7634647d951f0a6ce75abbef0ee,Urban Ecosystems,4,10.1007/s11252-022-01278-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138376081&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01278-9&partnerID=40&md5=1042b7634647d951f0a6ce75abbef0ee

However, little is known about the diversity and distribution of microbial communities across urban biotopes. Here, we compared testate amoeba communities in Moscow (63 samples from five urban parks) and Xiamen (69 samples from six urban parks) across four biotopes (tree hole, moss, soil, and sediment) to better understand microbial diversity and ecological processes shaping microbial communities. A total of 116 morphospecies (31 genera), corresponding to 90 in Moscow and 84 in Xiamen, were identified using light microscopy. The species richness per sample (mean ± standard error) was higher in Moscow parks (14 ± 1 species, n = 63) than Xiamen parks. The mean species richness per biotope was highest in the mosses (13 ± 1 species, n = 33). 13–26% of the total species richness was shared by all biotopes, indicating the ubiquitous distribution of testate amoeba morphospecies. The community composition in different biotopes markedly differed in both Moscow and Xiamen regions. Community connectivity varied among biotopes, and community complexity and dynamics were substantially stronger in soil and sediment. The stochastic processes explained a significantly high percentage of community composition in all biotopes (57–81%) in 11 parks. The standardized effect size for C-score in all biotopes changed from 1.48 to 6.92, indicating the enhanced significance of deterministic processes for the testate amoeba communities. The different relative importance of stochastic or deterministic processes in four studied biotopes suggests that factors influencing the testate amoeba communities greatly vary across heterogeneous urban environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11252-022-01306-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142904450&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01306-8&partnerID=40&md5=143399243e18c914cd29329cca26db47,Urban Ecosystems,15,10.1007/s11252-022-01306-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142904450&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-022-01306-8&partnerID=40&md5=143399243e18c914cd29329cca26db47

Owing to the complex, potentially nonlinear relationship between urban ecological systems and biophysical surface components in megacities, selecting the right quantitative models to evaluate their urban ecological quality is not always clear. Six typical megacities inside and outside China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, London, New York, and Tokyo) were taken as examples. 7 ecological indicators, including Air Quality Index (AQI), Road Density (RD), Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI), Wetness, Greenness, Dryness, and Heat, were integrated to a new model named as urban remote sensing ecological index (URSEI) using principal component analysis. The URSEI was used to quantitatively evaluate the ecological quality of Chinese and foreign megacities. Results show that London had the best ecological quality (0.542), followed by Guangzhou (0.533), Beijing (0.517), New York (0.511) and Shanghai (0.495). Tokyo had the lowest ecological quality (0. 445). Comparing the 7 indices within the URSEI, the ECI, Wetness and Greenness indices had positive effects on the ecology, while the AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat indices had negative effects. London and Guangzhou had high ECI and Greenness values and low AQI, RD, Dryness and Heat values. Hence, they had better ecological quality than those of the other four megacities. According to the spatial distribution of the URSEI, urban centers that were covered by high ratio of impervious surfaces and low ratio of vegetation had low ecological connectivity between the ecological land patches and had severe heat island effects and air pollution, which resulted in poor ecological quality. Areas covered by large amounts of vegetation had high Greenness and ECI values, and low Dryness, Heat and AQI values, which helped to improve the ecological quality. The URSEI can be used both as a quantitative indicator to describe the re-gional ecological quality, and to describe the spatial difference in the ecological quality of megacities. © 2021, China Environmental Science Press.

Scientific understanding and evaluation of regional ecological risks and construction of ecological security pattern are conducive to comprehensively improving the level of regional ecological security. Based on the remote sensing interpretation data onto Gaofen-2 of Zhangjiajie City in 2019, this paper used GIS spatial analysis and Fragstats software to construct landscape ecological risk index, and analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk. And the minimum cumulative resistance model is used to construct resistance surface. At the same time, in order to intuitively reflect the magnitude of resistance encountered during species migration, this paper uses 9 natural protected areas as ecological sources, and selects six resistance factors including landscape ecological index, vegetation coverage, elevation, slope, distance from roads, and distance from waters calculate the resistance value. Combining the ecological source area and the minimum cumulative resistance value, Then we identified ecological corridors and ecological nodes, and finally built an ecological security pattern and proposed ecological security protection strategies. This paper takes Zhangjiajie city as an example to verify the function and effectiveness of the method. The results show that: (1) there are obviously spatial differences in landscape ecological risk in the study area, and the ecological risk presents a spatial distribution pattern of “the middle and surrounding areas are low, and the high value area generally extends along the Lishui River in a strip”; (2) Low, relatively low, medium, relatively high, and high ecological risks area account for 21.59%, 41.79%, 22.57%, 12.08%, and 1.98%, respectively, among which the relatively low ecological risk area account for the highest proportion and the high ecological risk area account for the lowest proportion. The order of high ecological risk area pressure is: Yongding District>Cili County>Sangzhi County>Wulingyuan District; (3) The research identifies 24 ecological corridors and 47 ecological nodes.

To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region. Material and Methods. Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed. Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol. Conclusions. The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity of the region. © 2022 The authors.",10.18470/1992-1098-2022-2-102-114,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135853789&doi=10.18470%2f1992-1098-2022-2-102-114&partnerID=40&md5=ca2dab8755dc445a119c9e0d84b4d873,"South of Russia: Ecology, Development",3,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-2-102-114,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135853789&doi=10.18470%2f1992-1098-2022-2-102-114&partnerID=40&md5=ca2dab8755dc445a119c9e0d84b4d873

As the connected green space in the city, the ecological corridor plays an important role in the biodiversity conservation in the process of urbanization. As an important part of urban plant diversity, spontaneous plants provide resources for the survival of native animals and play a key role in the construction of low-maintenance plant landscape. In this study, we determined the overall composition of spontaneous species in the Wenyu River-North canal ecological corridor in Beijing, explored the changes of species composition and diversity characteristics of spontaneous plants with urbanization gradients, and analyzed the adaptability of different spontaneous species to urbanization. A total of 195 plant species were recorded which belonged to 156 genera and 73 families, and most of them were herbaceous plants. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity of spontaneous woody plants at different urbanization levels. However, the alpha-diversity of spontaneous herbaceous plants at medium urbanization level was significantly higher than that at other levels (P < 0.05). With the increase of urbanization index, the beta-diversity of woody plants, annual herbs and biennial herbs increased, and the beta-diversity of perennial herbs, invasive plants and exotic plants decreased. The mean niche width with urbanization gradient was ranked as invasive plants > native plants > domestic exotic plants > foreign exotic plants. According to the niche width, the ecological corridor autophytes were divided into high adaptability type, moderate adaptable type and low adaptable type. We screened some native plant species with similar adaptability to the 15 invasive plants according to niche overlap. The results can provide references for constructing stable low-maintenance spontaneous plant communities, that can resist the spread of invasive plants, so as to bring the function of biodiversity conservation of urban river ecological corridors into full play. © 2022 Science Press.

Pearson’s correlations and multiple regressions, followed by an analysis of the Akaike’s Information Criterion were conducted to study the relationships between the measured variables, and to identify which of the variables have a significant effect on bird and butterfly species richness and abundance. The results demonstrate that the percentage of canopy cover, park size and native vegetation are the best predictors of bird species richness and abundance. Meanwhile, the butterfly species richness and abundance can be best predicted by the percentage of canopy cover, shrub species and native vegetation. Based on these results and the identification of key features for bird and butterfly richness and abundance, nine recommendations are provided to improve biodiversity of small urban parks: (1) set minimum areas for a small urban park; 2) inclusion of water elements to support a wider range of species; (3) the application of internal patch-corridor-matrix features; (4) attention to the aspect of cleanliness and appearance of small parks; (5) the proportion of open and shaded areas; (6) the planting composition of trees, palms and shrubs should be designed not only with aesthetic functions, but also for biodiversity; (7) the vertical and horizontal layers of vegetation structures; (8) providing natural buffers for wildlife protection; and (9) creating unmanaged patches in sunny areas by using wildflowers. © 2020.

Studies of the effects of urbanization on fauna have emphasized taxonomic diversity, but this does not necessarily reflect effects on the evolutionary history of assemblages. Here, we study how urbanization influences phylogenetic diversity (PD) of bird assemblages in a small–medium city in the Central Andes of Colombia. Between 2016 and 2017, we performed bird surveys in 76 urban cells and 23 rural cells around the city. Then, we measured habitat characteristics (e.g. anthropogenic noise level, impervious and forested area) in sampled cells. PD of birds was between 1.37–1.42 MY higher in the rural than in the urban habitat. Within the urban habitat, the PD of birds reduces as impervious area and noise levels increase, while in the urban cells with most forested areas reach the highest PD values. Most of these differences and relationships disappear when we performed similar analysis controlling for differences in species richness. A low turnover of PD between assemblages of birds recorded inside Armenia and its less urbanized surroundings suggest green areas in the study area could mitigate the effects of urbanization in native fauna, and ameliorate connectivity between urban cells. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/01650521.2021.1974709,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118448600&doi=10.1080%2f01650521.2021.1974709&partnerID=40&md5=f88b1391c37e5684fda5ff1af9f3c290,Studies On Neotropical Fauna and Environment,8,10.1080/01650521.2021.1974709,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118448600&doi=10.1080%2f01650521.2021.1974709&partnerID=40&md5=f88b1391c37e5684fda5ff1af9f3c290

However, while some species remain common others are rare and have declined at a sharper rate. The Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) is classified as ‘Endangered’ on the Irish Red List, and ‘Vulnerable’ at European level. We aimed to investigate the ecology of B. distinguendus within the wider bumblebee community in its only remaining Irish population to inform conservation management. Eight true bumblebee species were recorded in total in four habitat types surveyed, with highest species richness in species-rich grassland and highest abundance in urban habitats. Highest numbers of B. distinguendus were found in two designated nature reserves. However, outside these reserves the species was only found in three of twelve sites surveyed in both species-rich and coastal grassland habitats. B. distinguendus is a late emerging species in this region with a foraging preference for Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Availability of key forage species was lowest when numbers of B. distinguendus were highest, potentially limiting survival of this species. Some smaller suitable habitats in urban areas and roadside verges were not used by the species, which suggests potential issues with habitat connectivity, patch size and/or availability of nesting and hibernation sites. Implications for insect conservation: Based on our findings, we suggest that existing species-rich and coastal grassland sites should be conserved, and other areas restored, for B. distinguendus in Ireland. Conservation management should focus on delaying cutting grasslands until late September, winter grazing of stock and reducing pesticides and fertilisers with the aim of increasing forage availability in late season, and ensuring that suitable habitats are connected in the landscape to allow adequate habitat area as well as movement and dispersal of the species to new areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101567501&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-021-00299-7&partnerID=40&md5=c0360dcc3fed554f9755e3cbdcf87df9,Journal of Insect Conservation,3,10.1007/s10841-021-00299-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101567501&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-021-00299-7&partnerID=40&md5=c0360dcc3fed554f9755e3cbdcf87df9

Constructing ecological networks is an effective means to avoid habitat destruction and fragmentation. Mountain areas are hotspots of biological habitats and biodiversity; however, the pace of urbanization in mountain areas is also accelerating. To protect an ecosystem more effectively, it is necessary to identify ecological corridors and ecological networks. Therefore, based on the Minimal Cumulative Resistance model and taking Chongqing in China as an example, the identification of potential ecological corridors and the construction of an ecological network in Chongqing were realized using the Linkage Mapper software. The results were as follows: (1) From 2005 to 2015, the patch area of cultivated land and grassland in Chongqing decreased by 0.08% and 1.46%, respectively, while that of built-up areas increased by 1.5%. The fragmentation degree of cultivated land was higher, and the internal connectivity of forestry areas was worse. (2) In total, 24 ecological sources were selected, and 87 potential ecological corridors and 35 ecological nodes were generated using the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis and the Conefor2.6 software. The total length of the ecological network in Chongqing is 2524.34 km, with an average corridor length of 29.02 km. (3) The overall complexity and network efficiency are high, but the spatial distribution of ecological corridors is uneven, especially in the southwest of Chongqing. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of our study is to provide insight into the local-scale urban movement habits of Long-eared Owls. Our study was carried out between 2015 and 2019 in the autumn and winter period, by observations in the early evening and by ringing and recapture of owls in the town of Sombor (NE Serbia). We observed owls when leaving the roosting site located in the town centre following the greenery of the larger avenues towards the outskirts. Owls were sporadically observed in densely built areas of the town, narrow streets with less greenery. Ringing and recapture data suggest that owls were closely linked to the green corridors. They probably used these corridors for easier orientation and to prey on birds roosting in trees in the town, such as sparrows (Passer domesticus, P. montanus), Common Blackbirds (Turdus merula) or Fieldfares (T. pilaris) appearing in harsh winters, and sometimes also pigeons. © 2020 Thomas Oliver Méro et al., published by Sciendo 2020.",10.2478/orhu-2020-0014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112108876&doi=10.2478%2forhu-2020-0014&partnerID=40&md5=10df30de3c7d89feee09b62ab3110591,Ornis Hungarica,2,10.2478/orhu-2020-0014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112108876&doi=10.2478%2forhu-2020-0014&partnerID=40&md5=10df30de3c7d89feee09b62ab3110591

In this study, 39 species of key protected plants in Xiamen were selected as the objects. MaxENT, a species distribution model is used to predicate the potential distribution of species. Zonation, a quantitative tool for Spatial Conservation Priority, is used to identify the areas that are suitable for the survival of key protected plants and can ensure the landscape connectivity, so as to obtain the multi species landscape protection level of local key protected plants. According to the 2020 global biodiversity target, 17% of the areas with the highest level of landscape protection will be regarded as the spatial conservation prioritization areas of multi species. Combined with the weighted extinction risk curve with landscape loss generated by zonation model, 8% of the areas with the highest level of protection are classified as primary conservation areas, and the areas with the protection level ranging from 8% to 17% are classified as secondary conservation areas. By using jackknife method in MaxENT, it is found that altitude is the most important environmental factor affecting the distribution of local key protected plants, and spatial conservation prioritization areas are concentrated in the coastal zone with lower altitude. The spatial conservation prioritization areas in this study were compared with nature reserve, the planning of ecological function zones, land use planning and urban master planning of Xiamen, it is found that the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the West and north of Xiamen are well protected; the spatial conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone of southwest and southeast of the island and the eastern and southern of outside the Xiamen island have been occupied by construction land on a large scale. there are few areas included in the scope of nature reserves, and a large number of coastal conservation prioritization areas are vacant; although the part of the conservation prioritization areas in the southeast of outside the Xiamen island are not occupied, they are planned as reserve land for development and lack of ecological protection. In order to avoid the further reduction of conservation prioritization areas, we should focus on the ecological protection of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone. The conservation prioritization areas that belong to development reserve will be converted into ecological space. We should strictly control the further development and utilization of conservation prioritization areas in the coastal zone so as to protect biodiversity. For the primary and secondary conservation areas, we should implement rigid and flexible ecological conservation measures, and coordinate the relationship between protection and development in conservation prioritization areas. © 2021 Science Press.

Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4. Result: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks. Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning inconservation, management and development. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)",10.22438/JEB/42/3(SI)/JEB-09,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107976971&doi=10.22438%2fJEB%2f42%2f3%28SI%29%2fJEB-09&partnerID=40&md5=2bdd0900d6fcdf1cf7852dea3d0a6ced,Journal of Environmental Biology,6,10.22438/JEB/42/3(SI)/JEB-09,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107976971&doi=10.22438%2fJEB%2f42%2f3%28SI%29%2fJEB-09&partnerID=40&md5=2bdd0900d6fcdf1cf7852dea3d0a6ced

Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population.

The construction of ecological network can mitigate the damage caused by the rapid urbanization and the fragmentation of urban and rural landscapes and is of great significance for the protection of urban biodiversity.Method: This paper selects Yanqing District of Beijing as the research area. Based on the ArcGIS software platform, the remote sensing image of Yanqing District of Beijing was interpreted to obtain the land cover type. The land cover type was divided into foreground and background by the ArcGIS. The analysis method (MSPA) obtained seven types of landscape types and identified the core area as an important ecological source. The accumulative cost distance model and the network analysis were used to obtain the ecological network under the best threshold. Based on this, the ecological network optimization proposal of Yanqing District was proposed.Result: (1) The overall fragmentation degree in Yanqing District was low, the material and energy migration among different types were relatively smooth and the overall landscape diversity was higher, but the number of habitat patches in the city was less and the corridor was scarce; (2) the distance threshold, which was most suitable for the current structure of the ecological network in Yanqing District was 20 000 m and the network closure degree α was 0.73; (3) woodland and cultivated land were important landscape types of potential ecological corridors in the study area and forest area was the largest, it was 17 452.9 ha, accounting for 81.1% of the total corridor area.Conclusion: The MSPA method has the advantages of accurate and detailed evaluation of geometric connectivity, small amount of data required and visualization of analysis results. The network analysis method could optimize the ecological network. Therefore, based on the MSPA method and network analysis method, the accuracy of the ecological network construction in Yanqing District is more detailed and accurate. The research results have important guiding and practical value for the construction of ecological network and biodiversity protection in Yanqing District. The ecological network construction in Yanqing District could provide a reference for the other areas. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

There are large patches of settlement near the Beijing Capital International Airport, and there are few forests and green spaces around the airport and the central city. In terms of visually spatial pattern, the highways and lower-grade roads in Shunyi District mostly have higher green view, the spatial distribution of green view in county roads is uneven, and the green view of roads in the center of the district is generally low. Overall, the length of the road sections with the medium and lower-medium green view was nearly 6 0 %, and there were fewer road sections having the above-average green view, especially the high-level green view. Therefore, there remain large room for improving the ecological service by landsenses creation. Furthermore, this study aimed to improve the urban ecological space services of Shunyi District and summarized four core visions of ecological space landscape pattern optimization, visual space pattern optimization, scientific planning and management of ecological space, and comprehensive improvement of ecosystem services. Based on the four visions, the targeted measures for landscape creation were proposed, including strengthening the ecological protection of shallow mountainous areas, constructing leisure and recreation zone along the shallow mountains and Chaobai River, increasing the quality of the visual space of Shunyi District, improving the ecological space leisure and recreation services in Shunyi District, clarifying the urban ecological space planning, strictly observing the ecological protection red line, improving landscape diversity, and constructing ecological corridors, etc. © 2020 Science Press.

A rational and effective ecological network construction can restore the connection between broken habitat patches in cities. The construction and simulation of the existing urban ecological network are mostly based on two-dimensional data information, and the impact of the multi-ecological niche represented by the three-dimensional structure information of vegetation on the habitat quality is not well considered, so the function effectiveness of the ecological network remains to be verified. This paper quantified the three-dimensional green space vegetation structure based on the airborne LiDAR and high-resolution remote sensing image data in the main urban area of Nanjing city. We extracted the ecological source area and built the landscape resistance surface in two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and identified the ecological corridor under the two scenarios based on least-cost path method. Meanwhile we identified the ecological key nodes in the corridors that need to be protected according to the circuit theory, then analyzed the impact of using two-dimensional and three-dimensional ecological spatial information on the results of ecological network construction. The results show that: 1) there are 11 different ecological sources extracted under different scenarios within the study area. Compared with the traditional two-dimensional scenario, using three-dimensional vegetation parameters can more accurately identify ecological sources with rich vegetation structures. 2) There are 137 and 129 ecological corridors constructed in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios, and the average unit resistance of each corridor is 18.2 and 24.0, respectively. The traditional two-dimensional information simulation overestimated the landscape connectivity of the study area. 3) The spatial distribution of key ecological nodes in different scenarios is similar, mainly concentrated in the northwest, middle and southeast of the study area, and more often appear in the source patches with close distance. Based on the above results, this paper proposes some targeted strategies to guide the construction and optimization of the ecological network pattern in the main urban area of Nanjing city. © 2020 Science Press.

Reconstructing the ecological networks is greatly critical to the improvement of the regional ecosystem services, as well as the maintaining of biodiversity and landscape diversity. For the reconstruction of the ecological safety network of Xuzhou City, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and landscape index were used to extract the ecological sources with great value for the maintenance of urban ecosystems health. Then, the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCR) was used to build ecological resistance surfaces and extract the potential ecological corridors. Circuit theory combined with the graph theory and network structure analysis were used to quantitatively evaluate and optimize the ecological network. The results show that there are 237 ecological sources, mainly distributed in the southwest part of Xuzhou City, with a total area of 6 421. 49 hm2. However, additional 70 small ecological habitats and 192 ecological corridors should be added to make up the deficiencies of current ecological network. The reconstruction of ecological network could obviously reduce the landscape fragmentation and patch separation, and increase the patch connectivity and adhesion degree, and as a result the regional landscape pattern and ecological security will be improved.

Most green roof biodiversity studies have not considered whether the roof height affects community composition and abundance of species present. This study focused on evaluating beetle diversity and abundance in relation to roof height, with emphasis on wildflower roofs. The key results of the study confirm previous studies found that extensive wildflower green roofs are capable of supporting fairly rich beetle communities, including some rare/scarce species. However, an increase of roof height was found to negatively impact both beetle abundance and richness, despite all recorded species being well adapted to active flight and thus dispersal. In addition forb cover decreased with roof height which consequently influenced beetle community structure. These results are therefore indicative that further research is required on species communities found on extensive green roofs that are less adapted to active flight and consequently vertical dispersal. This study further highlights the need for vertical and horizontal connectivity between green roofs and the surrounding natural habitats as a management tool to increase the general ecological value of urban green spaces. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.05.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066961999&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2019.05.010&partnerID=40&md5=778c6d1652c5039a43b5cf1e4405cbd0,Landscape and Urban Planning,3,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.05.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066961999&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2019.05.010&partnerID=40&md5=778c6d1652c5039a43b5cf1e4405cbd0

The objective of this study is to analyze forest remnants with native vegetation characteristics using a free GIS. This analysis takes place using landscape metrics and was based on the supervised vectorization of land use in the municipality of California, PR. The area of the vectored polygons was obtained and a classified, and then the calculation was made with the nearest neighbor index, mean distance observed, Patton diversity index and the perimeter/area ratio of forest fragments. The results show that most of the fragments have an area smaller than 1 ha, the fragments with more significant area (<50 ha) represent more than 16% of the native vegetation area. The small fragments are important to maintain the connectivity, since the withdrawal of these increases the mean distance observed and nearest neighbor index. Most of the fragments are elongated and amorphous in accordance with the perimeter/area ratio and the Patton diversity index respectively, this may demonstrate the fragments may be subject to edge effects. Even with these characteristics, these fragments may be part of what is planned in public policy for preservation in the Atlantic Forest in the state of Paraná.

The results indicated that the spatial distribution of patches in current park green space was uneven and area discrepancy was large, which is especially true in densely populated areas with less patch number of park green space and obviously low available area for disaster shelter. By substantially increasing the quantity and area of patches, improving the inter-patch connectivity, and increasing landscape fragmentation index appropriately, the ""point-line-plane"" pattern of park green space system in Nanchang would be optimized and the spatial distribution would be more rational, which could effectively enhance its role in biodiversity conservation, disaster prevention, and risk avoidance.

However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. Land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables.

The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts. Methods: Fifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m2 plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales. Results: Canopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests. Conclusions: Canopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs. © 2018, The Author(s).",10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059134834&doi=10.1186%2fs40490-018-0124-8&partnerID=40&md5=d4d28b85af06ee7dd61a75ff23ef949c,New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science,3,10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193189491; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8.pdf; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6268006; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8; https://nzjforestryscience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40490-018-0124-8

Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only. Our study shows that cities represent unique settings for hybridization, caused by multiple introductions of non-native taxa. Cityscape structure and invasion histories of cities will determine future evolutionary pathways at these novel hybrid zones. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar = 8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range = 6.49–7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F ST = 0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F ST = 0.01 ± 0.01; n = 16 P = 0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (r p = 0.06–0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (< 1.7 km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape.

Spatial pattern of urban impervious surface density is an important factor affecting the waterlogging. This paper aims to provide a new method to optimize the spatial pattern of impervious surface in order to reduce urban waterlogging by the integration of SCS-CN model and the Ant colony algorithm. Firstly, the density of urban impervious surface was estimated by remote sensing images through the method of linear spectral mixing modeling. Secondly, the CN value was corrected by using the Williams formula. Then, the modified SCS-CN model was used to calculate the surface runoff. Thirdly, according to the goal of minimizing runoff coefficient, the spatial pattern of impervious surface of 18 runoff plots was optimized by Ant colony algorithm. Fourthly, landscape pattern indices were used to analyze the spatial pattern of impervious surface. The results show that: in rainfall reappearing periods of 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years and 100 years, the optimized impervious surface pattern could reduce the runoff coefficient by 21.19%, 19.58%, 19.38%, 18.93%, 18.41% and 17.25%, respectively. Based on the experimental results above, this research puts forward three suggestions for the optimization of urban renewal. ① Increase the area of grassland, garden, trees and other vegetation types to reduce the high impervious surface area which can be further divided into patches of lower levels of impervious surface. ② Gather low and medium-to-low types of impervious surface to increase the connectivity and the medium-to-high levels of impervious surface. ③ Increase the quantity and density of patches in each runoff plot and reduce the degree of spread and aggregation. © 2017, Science Press.

However, we still lack an ex-post method to capture the consequences of accomplished urban structure shift (from monocentric to polycentric), which is guided by the land use planning. To fill this gap, we develop an ex-post evaluation approach which integrates counterfactual analysis and landscape graphs. Counterfactual analysis is combined with cellular automata simulation model, to uncover what the city might look like, if it had continued to expand in a monocentric structure; and the landscape graphs enable us to reveal the possible landscape connectivity in actual and counterfactual scenarios. We select Nanjing city as the study area and 4 target species, to delve into the varying impacts of the urban structure shift on different taxonomic groups. Our case study demonstrates that: (1) the impact of urban structure shift is more relevant to the long disperser; (2) the actual landscape (polycentric) would facilitate the bird's dispersal, while (3) forest mammals have higher connectivity in the counterfactual scenario (monocentric), and the possible reasons are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the urban structure shift might not necessarily cause the connectivity decline, on condition that the key connectivity providers are identified by integrating ecological network analysis into the land use planning, and well preserved in the shift. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.094,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037532049&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2017.12.094&partnerID=40&md5=b8060a5cfcae03bf1429b3b9ecea86f1,Science of the Total Environment,5,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.094,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29890583/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717335209; https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6154263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890583; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ScTEn.622.1143H/abstract; http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29890583

Using 2-D wavelet multiresolution analysis and satellite-derived fractional vegetation cover (Fr), the variability of landscape metrics from Landsat (30 m) to MODIS (1 km) scales are investigated. According to our findings, metrics of Patch Density and Landscape Shape Index can be used at the 1-km scale to asses density and geometric complexity of urban form. With the addition of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, available at high temporal resolution, a move away from or toward more sustainable urban forms is defined in relation to mitigation of the urban heat island.

Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (SP) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CP). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between SP and CP. The most pronounced differences were that SP were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of SP and CP were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between SP and CP. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in SP. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CP, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of SP seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management. © 2018 Laurenti Verlag.

The environmental impact of the resulting land-cover pattern and associated ecosystem services are frequently evaluated at a crude spatial resolution only. However, wild animals use remaining interconnected fine-grain open spaces as an infrastructure for movement. In this paper, we traced the evolution of an open-space system in Haifa, Israel, and examined the impact of urban morphology on size and distribution of open spaces at different spatial resolutions. At a 30 m resolution, our analysis indicated fragmentation and increasing partial elimination of open spaces. Over time the connectivity declined at a diminishing rate, yet the network did not disintegrate into separate components. The evolution analysis implied that in crude resolution, the open space network is threatened. At a 5 m resolution, our analysis showed that Haifa remains porous to animal movement. Using combined multiple least-cost paths through the urban landscape of heterogeneous permeability, we illustrated extensive connectivity among open spaces. Backyards and other urban in-between spaces complemented the seminatural open-space network connectivity, enabling wildlife movement between habitat patches and thus survival in an urbanized environment. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",10.1177/0265813515598991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983027705&doi=10.1177%2f0265813515598991&partnerID=40&md5=d2fcfddfdb06175d9036e05a85a75535,Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design,4,10.1177/0265813515598991,https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/envirb/v43y2016i5p848-870.html; https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5664278; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265813515598991; https://econpapers.repec.org/article/saeenvirb/v_3a43_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a848-870.htm; http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1289268; http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265813515598991

Yet these two issues have never been formally integrated together in a model that simultaneously models abundance while accounting for connectivity of a landscape. We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km2 area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes. This study provides an application of capture-recapture models based on ecological distance, allowing us to directly estimate landscape connectivity.

These threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance, but ultimately ecosystem functions and services. Thus, seed dispersers such as the straw-coloured fruit bat, E. helvum, which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes, are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking of movements, field observations and gut retention experiments, we quantify dispersal distances for small- and large-seeded fruits foraged by E. helvum during periods of colony population low (wet season) and high (dry season) in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of Ghana. Gut passage time averaged 116 min (range 4-1143 min), comparable to other fruit bats. Movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season. As the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts, median dispersal distances were similar for both large (42-67 m) and small (42-65 m) seeds. However, small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 75.4 km, four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similar-sized frugivore. Maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural (49.7 km) compare to the urban (31.2 km) landscape. Within the urban landscape, estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season (75.4 km) compared to the wet season (22.8 km); in contrast, distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season (67 km) compared to the dry season (24.4). Dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season (551 m) in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season (319 m). We found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances. The maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts (mean distance from food tree 263 m) was 4.7%. Small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances, >500 and >1000 m, with a likelihood of 3.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. Our data show that E. helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances, probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical Africa. We suggest E. helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation. © 2016 The Authors.",10.1016/j.gecco.2016.03.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964994954&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2016.03.005&partnerID=40&md5=207cd6847a63a5d054f04be520aa9c4e,Global Ecology and Conservation,5,10.1016/j.gecco.2016.03.005,https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/34999; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/52521403-719b-353f-a33e-13d9e4d436c3/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989415300457; https://core.ac.uk/display/46100314; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989415300457; https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2275699

These are services such as goods and products (e.g., fresh water, fuel), regulation of natural processes (e.g., climate, flooding, erosion), and nonmaterial benefits (e.g., recreation, aesthetic enjoyment). Many cities are located in the important ecological areas. Currently 29 out of the 825 ecological zones of ecological areas are under urban development in the world so that more than one-third of the areas have been human constructed. It is predicted that by 2030, 15 other ecological areas of 118 vertebrate species specific and rare, at least the about 5% of the total area, will be built. On the other hand, the reflections have led to the phenomenon of urbanization in the world in terms of environmental considerations. The two look quite the opposite in such a way that they are as a challenge for the ecosystem or an opportunity. On the one hand, this phenomenon eliminates natural ecosystems or at least makes it apart. It promotes non-native species, changes and reduces ecosystem and eventually disrupts normal diet. The urbanization can create some social and economic opportunities, connection of people and nature, unique environmental areas and increase ecosystem services based on the principles of sustainable planning and design. In the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), three roles have been defined for cities: 1-Maintaining ecosystem goods and services in towns and cities 2-protecting biological diversity in cities and towns and promoting sustainable planning and design at various scales to maximize self-reliance of these areas 3-Promoting effective policy to create a livable, not only for humans, but plants and animals in man-made environments. Accordingly, it can be said that urban biodiversity points to all communities, plants, animals and microorganisms that live in and around the city. Howard achieved this goal outside of the cities and new cities. While today's computing ecosystem services and biodiversity studies are in different scales of global, national, regional, urban-rural, and even at the district levels, block design and spatial resolution has had an important role in maintaining and improving the ecological balance. To achieve a sustainable level, we consider the performance of public services, urban management. To develop patterns that emerged from the concept of sustainable development, the New Urbanism, pedestrian areas and TOD are examples of it. The concept of ecological cities and villages were discussed as a tool to achieve sustainable development in three areas: (A) As a tool to open the original settlement structure, increased density around the center, restoration of the natural environment and agricultural landscapes in the spaces. (B) City network: a new model for open collaborative development in the surrounding areas that leads to the formation of the city's network and metropolitan area network. The spatial pattern, the area between the green and blue urban centers will be assigned to the matrix. (C) In conjunction with landscape architecture and planning development ecosystem. The tools, designed by James Corner and Charles Vadhaym landscape architecture in urban scale in the United States and in Europe Krysynz expanded major role. Studies of ecosystem services and biodiversity in cities are considered in the past two decades. The importance of this issue in urban planning has been observed in the world major cities, including Frankfurt. The studies have been conducted in the three-phase investigation, representation, and control of the land to be annexed to the application process. A recent evaluation of policies, particularly in the area of urban green spaces, green corridors, green belts and important results in maintaining and even improving the ecosystem of valuable resources and the conservation of biodiversity are represented in urban and land use planning reform measures. As one of the most important urban green space to urban habitats, it provides humans with unique perspective to a variety of flora and fauna, as well as direct access to nature. Keeping in touch with nature citizens is a basic need and a criterion for quality of life. Ecosystem services and biodiversity are high quality urban green areas, environmental benefits, economic, and psychological offers. Studying the process of planning and development and the spread of the best practices based on the minimization of ecosystem services and urban development can be realized as two seemingly contradictory trends and competitor. Thus, an optimal choice is to provide policy development, conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity in general elections. This research answers to three important questions. First, what type of services does ecosystems, general in cities and specifically in urban management, have and what types of the strategies have been used to maintain and improve these services? Second, what are the main criteria and methods of analysis of planning and design of urban development in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity considerations? Third, what kinds of processes in the ecological integrity of space are seen in the city of Ahvaz and what is the priority of strategic choice to increase the connectivity of the areas? Materials and methods: There are two basic types of metrics at the patch level: (1) indices of the spatial character and context of individual patches, and (2) measures of the deviation from class and landscape norms; that is, how much the computed value of each metric for a patch deviates from the class and landscape means. The deviation statistics are useful in identifying patches with extreme values on each metric. There are two basic types of metrics at the class level: (1) indices of the amount and spatial configuration of the class, and (2) distribution statistics that provide first- and second-order statistical summaries of the patch metrics for the focal class. Like class metrics, there are two basic types of metrics at the landscape level. Landscapes are composed of elements-the spatial components that make up the landscape. A convenient and popular model to conceptualize and represent the elements in a categorical map pattern (or patch mosaic) is known as the patch-corridor-matrix model. Under this model, three major landscape elements are typically recognized, and the extent and configuration of these elements defines the pattern of the landscape. While individual patches possess relatively few fundamental spatial characteristics (e.g., size, perimeter, and shape), collections of patches may have a variety of aggregate properties, depending on whether the aggregation is over a single class (patch type) or multiple classes, and whether the aggregation is within a specified subregion of a landscape (e.g., the neighborhood of each focal cell) or across the entire landscape. Consequently, landscape metrics can be defined at four levels corresponding to a logical hierarchical organization of spatial heterogeneity in patch mosaics. It is important to note that while many metrics have counterparts at several levels; their interpretations may be somewhat different. Cell metrics represent the spatial context of local neighborhoods centered on each cell. Patch metrics represent the spatial character and context of individual patches. Class metrics represent the amount and spatial distribution of a single patch type and are interpreted as fragmentation indices. Landscape metrics represent the spatial pattern of the entire landscape mosaic and generally interpreted more broadly as landscape heterogeneity indices because they measure the overall landscape structure. Hence, it is important to interpret each metric in a manner appropriate to its level (cell, patch, class, or landscape). Aggregation refers to the tendency of patch types to be spatially aggregated; that is, to occur in large, aggregated or ""contagious"" distributions. This property is also often referred to as landscape texture. We use the term ""aggregation"" as an umbrella term to describe several closely related concepts: 1) dispersion, 2) interspersion, 3) subdivision, and 4) isolation. In these exercises, future scenarios are constructed by making different assumptions on the underlying driving forces, and hence on the magnitude of land use change processes. For instance, Khajeh Borj Sefidi and colleagues built different land use scenarios by varying the rates of agricultural, river, vacant and urban expansion. Less attention has been devoted so far to the effects on ecosystem services of different spatial arrangements of land uses. The effects of spatial patterns on ecological processes represent one of the central themes of landscape ecology. Scientists have tried to understand these effects for a broad range of ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, pollination and water purification. According to a recent article, the capacity of a land system to deliver ecosystem services is determined by the kind, magnitude and spatial patterns of land uses. Research on land use change and ecosystem services has widely addressed the first two attributes but has disregarded so far the third one, spatial patterns. To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies presented in the literature considered scenarios that differ only in the distribution of land use types, rather than in their relative proportions. The paper presents case-study research aimed at empirically exploring how the implementation of different land use zoning policies can affect the future supply of ecosystem services.

Consequently, it is necessary to find out the impacts of land use change on habitat network as well as the dispersal and migration of species, especially in current rapid urbanizing condition. The research results will be a great contribution to rebuilding and optimizing regional ecological network from the perspective of species conservation and ecological process, but not only the landscape structure as most previous research did. The aim of the paper is to find out: (1) how to map out the habitat network of a certain species from TM images in a grid pattern? (2) How land use change affected the habitat network of the species, especially from the views of habitat patch and network structure? The Su-Xi-Chang Area of the Yangtze River Delta Area was selected as case study due to its rapid urban development and land use changes. In this research, the Egretta garzetta was selected as a regional representative species for the following three reasons: (1) marshland birds are the superior species among wild animals of the study area; (2) Egretta garzetta is the superior species among marshland birds which is on the list of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); (3) the data related to living and hunting habitats of Egretta garzetta in the study area are easy to get. Based on the study of the Egretta garzetta habitat, we developed a Conceptual Constraint Model of Species Habitat Patch (CCMSHP) and a method to select habitat patch properly from different land types. In CCMSHP, factors which affect the forming of species habitat were classified into three categories coarsely, which are physical, biological, and human disturbances. In each category, main specific constraints were obtained from previous results and transferred suitably from the calculation supported by the ArcGIS software. Based on the identified Egretta garzetta habitats, their habitat networks were accordingly developed. Then, landscape metrics and network structure indicators were applied to analyze the effect of land use change on the mapped-out habitat network. The results showed that: (1) the total area of patches suitable for Egretta garzetta’s living and hunting was increased during the period from 2000 to 2010; however, the quality of the habitat network was decreased seriously due to the strong negative effect of newly-built constructions, such as expressways and high-speed railways. (2) The habitat network of Egretta garzetta is only a small part of the whole area which consists of four separate fractions. They were Yixing-Liyang Part, Binhu Part, Wuzhong Part, and Yangchenghu Part and ranked down respectively, according to their conditions of 2000. During the recent ten years, these fractions have been seriously destroyed. Among of them, Yixing-Liyang Part was in the worst condition and then following by Binhu, Wuzhong and Yangchenghu Part. In a summary, during the past ten years, the condition of Egretta garzetta habitat environment was becoming worse; and the land use change has affected the survival of Egretta garzetta badly. We suggest that the protection both of high and low-level patches in hierarchy is important and it is necessary to identify and rebuilt those disappeared low-level patches to improve the quality of habitat network. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

Habitat fragmentation and the resultant decrease in habitat connectivity has become a serious challenge for biodiversity conservation. Green spaces are important habitat resources in the city. The development of green space ecological networks can be used to increase the connectivity between fragmented habitat patches, which promotes urban biological diversity conservation. Taking Bazhong western new district, a rapidly urbanizing area in Sichuan, China, as a case study, a novel method is proposed using Guidos, GIS and the gravity model to develop green space ecological networks. First, the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) model in the software Guidos was used to identify the main types and structure of green spaces in the landscape. The “cores”and “bridges”were extracted, which will make the foundation of the green space network. Second, using the software Conefor, the integral index of connectivity (IIC), probability of connectivity (PC) and the percentage of importance (dI) of each individual element were used to evaluate the relative importance of these cores and bridges to landscape connectivity. Accordingly, the top ten core patches acting as ecological sources were identified. The remaining cores and bridges were ranked based on their importance in maintaining ecological network connectivity. Finally, using GIS, potential ecological networks were developed using the least-cost path method, and the important corridors were identified using the Gravity model. A plan to optimize the ecological network in the study area was put forward. This research shows that the structural elements, the cores and bridges of ecological networks can be identified via the MSPA method and that landscape connectivity measurements (IIC, PC and dI) provide good quantitative measures of the relative importance of landscape patches, especially when considering landscape patch spatial distributions. The evaluation of landscape patches can help to identify and extract important protected landscape elements. Least-cost path analysis also provides important reference information for evaluating landscape patch habitat quality, which most previous researches have evaluated by subjective assessments. The research results show that the combination of MSPA with measures of landscape connectivity and least-cost path analysis are a novel and useful method for developing green space ecological networks in urban and other fragmented areas. The results will help to guide the development and management of green spaces for biodiversity conservation. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

Most sustainable urban growth concepts (e.g. new urbanism, urban containment and smart growth) built on the findings from the first generation of research and have a strong focus on the transport-land use relation, aiming at reducing private (car) mobility and related C02- emissions and air pollution. Research shows that higher density, land-use diversity and pedestrian-friendly designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-car mobility, although the results are still ambiguous (Colding et al, forthcoming). Creeping global environmental changes, natural catastrophes and volatile financial markets, highlight the need to put emphasis also on strategies of adaptation as a complement to environmental mitigation strategies of cities (Vale et al 2005). This type of research concerns the understanding of the resilience of urban systems in which urban systems are seen as integrated social-ecological systems, bridging the ancient dichotomy between human and ecological systems. Research shows that green spaces and its fragmentation are crucial for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. One of the most relevant variables affecting landscape fragmentation is population density (Jaeger 2000). Indeed, urban sprawl causes directly land cover changes at the urban fringe and impacts indirectly on the rural landscape progressively further away from the urban fringe by fragmenting both agricultural areas and woodlands (Salvati et al 2012). However, city compactness and higher densities decrease the amount and access to green space within cities (Pauleit et al 2005, Burton 2000). This paper especially focus on green space and its fragmentation and accessibility within cities and comlDine the human perspective on green space with the landscape ecological perspective in the aim to develop knowledge that opens for integration of ecosystem design in urban design, moving towards an expanded professional practice of social-ecological urban design. To include the ecological perspective we use effective mesh density, which is a direct quantitative expression of landscape connectivity (Jaeger 2000) and biotope diversity (Marini et al 2010). To include the human perspective we build on the methods to measure cognitive accessibility developed within Space syntax research (Hillier 1996) and especially the measures proposed by Stähle et al (2005, 2008) in which besides the measure of distance, also a measure of attraction is introduced. Through this we aim to include the described ecological measures in the framework of Space syntax, enabling us to use accessible green space both from a human and an ecological perspective. Important stepping-stone structures within the network (patches and links with more importance from one or both perspectives) can be traced and interventions can be proposed to improve (parts of) the system. This paper presents, firstly, a conceptual discussion on this topic and secondly, results from a study in Stockholm showing in principle the possibility of a spatial morphology of social-ecological urban systems.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006263267&partnerID=40&md5=5caacf6cd188bdab00528ef51e606d9d,2013 International Space Syntax Symposium,2,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006263267&partnerID=40&md5=5caacf6cd188bdab00528ef51e606d9d

The isolating nature of catchment boundaries over evolutionary timescales makes them potentially important in defining natural units for biodiversity management. We sought to clarify biogeographical relationships amongst drainages within Australia's biodiverse mid-eastern coastal region (Fitzroy, Burnett, and Mary Catchments) where freshwater communities face considerable urban pressure, using a locally endemic riverine specialist, the white-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula. Mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite data sets were employed to investigate past and present influences on population connectivity and to identify units for management. Populations within catchments were largely well connected genetically. However, the Fitzroy Catchment contained a distinct genetic lineage, deeply divergent from a second lineage present across the Burnett and Mary Catchments. The two lineages can be considered evolutionarily significant units that reflect historical isolation of the Fitzroy and recent coalescence of the Burnett-Mary Catchments during lowered Pleistocene sea levels. Congruence with geological evidence and patterns reported for fish and macroinvertebrates supports a shared biogeographical history of a diverse regional biota.

This process is called biotic homogenization, which is usually studied at large scale from species lists. Our paper addresses the effects of urbanization on plant community at local scale in areas where urban policies are implemented. We focus on private gardens as they are the most common components of green spaces in European urbanized areas. They are also a place where exotic species are introduced. Observations were made on spontaneous flora sampled from gardens in two study sites of the French Mediterranean: a large city and a village located in an urbanizing rural area. We evaluated how urban landscape influences floristic similarity and how exotic species affect homogenization. We divided each study site in three built-up density zones. As the urbanization process of both sites did not take place at the same time, we were able to assess the effect of time on floristic similarity. Results indicate that floristic similarity is less important in high dense built-up areas than in low dense ones. Exotic species tend to reduce floristic similarity in city centers and increase floristic similarity in low dense built-up areas in both sites. Landscape metrics calculated in built-up areas surrounding the gardens influence floristic similarity. Lastly, we found that urban planning in terms of built-up density affects biodiversity distribution and that private gardens can provide landscape connectivity within urban areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.05.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904749562&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2014.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=cebd5102718f22e737563918bf5e8446,Landscape and Urban Planning,4,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.05.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904749562&doi=10.1016%2fj.landurbplan.2014.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=cebd5102718f22e737563918bf5e8446

Many populations of pond-Breeding amphibians are assumed to follow metapopulation dynamics, and connectivity is mostly measured between breeding ponds. However, the habitat of pond-Breeding amphibians is not only defined by the pond but, typically, consists of a breeding pond surrounded by clusters of disjoint summer-habitat patches interspersed with an agricultural/semi-urban matrix. We hypothesise that the internal structure of a habitat patch may change connectivity in two ways: (i) by affecting animal movements and thereby emigration and immigration probabilities; and (ii) by affecting habitat quality and population size. To test our hypotheses, we apply a spatially explicit individual-Based model of Moor frog dispersal. We find that the realised connectivity depends on internal structure of both the target and the source patch as well as on how habitat quality is affected by patch structure. Although fragmentation is generally thought to have negative effects on connectivity, our results suggest that, depending on patch structure and habitat quality, positive effects on connectivity may occur. © Author(s) 2013.",10.5194/we-13-21-2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901752939&doi=10.5194%2fwe-13-21-2013&partnerID=40&md5=16d97ecc0ee427dabf4f3611132dc8b0,Web Ecology,2,10.5194/we-13-21-2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901752939&doi=10.5194%2fwe-13-21-2013&partnerID=40&md5=16d97ecc0ee427dabf4f3611132dc8b0

Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structured-exhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05493.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862778502&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-294X.2012.05493.x&partnerID=40&md5=a0664332749440a07881997a883dbb2f,Molecular Ecology,8,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05493.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862778502&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-294X.2012.05493.x&partnerID=40&md5=a0664332749440a07881997a883dbb2f

Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. The survival of wildlife species is subjected to enormous pressure due to natural environmental changes and human activities. Agent-based models (ABMs) are computer simulation models analyzing and simulating human or animal behavior through the integration of learning, adaptation, evolution and logical analysis. ABMs study the overall system characteristics by analyzing internal elements of the system (such as the interaction among individual agents, and agents with the environment) with a bottom-up approach. The agents in ABMs can complete given objectives, perceive and respond to changes of the external environment through the default logic control, and respond to stimuli from other agents and the external environment through learning and adaptation functions. This paper designed an agent-based evaluation model of an ecological pattern, which was used to analyze the impact of different woodland patterns on species survival and dispersal. The model focused on the logic control of survival and dispersal of agents, and used the dispersal strategy integrating CRW and LW models, which combines the advantages of these two models. The survival of the agent is control by the age-specified U-shaped survival curve and determination function considering their own energy and environmental risks. The model was developed on the GIS platform, realizing the seamless integration of the agent model and GIS, which could then be applied to real geographical environment simulation. Qingdao is a city located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. Woodland is mainly distributed in the Laoshan Mountains in the east, the Daze Mountains in the north, and the Dazhu, Xiaozhu and Tiejue Mountains in the south. In the study area, the ecological environment is deteriorating, and various wildlife species are being impacted, with some species being endangered or facing extinction. This paper selected the woodlands in the Qingdao district as the study object, analyzing the effect of different spatial patterns on the survival and spread of woodland species. Simulation results showed that, compared with the original state, species populations and migration have improved significantly under different levels of ecological network framework, and the higher the level of ecological network framework, the more obvious the improvement. The distance between patches had a large influence on the dispersal of simulated species because they were not able to arrive at patches that were far away from the original patch. Therefore, this paper makes the suggestion that an approach integrating wetland and woodland systems could strengthen woodland system functional contact in the study area. It is suggested that the region around Jiaozhou Bay and the mainstream of Dagu River be used to increase the spatial distribution of woodland. Based on the simulation results, suggestions for the woodland ecological pattern construction are given below: (1) ensure that the large woodland can not be destroyed; (2) the wetland system district in the middle of Qingdao is an ideal place for a new woodland construction; (3) the ecological network framework can be used as a spatial reference for an ecological barrier to prevent the spread of urban land into woodland.",10.5846/stxb201203290441,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872248618&doi=10.5846%2fstxb201203290441&partnerID=40&md5=f6449a0e84a6cd06bc118c0878b4b949,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,6,10.5846/stxb201203290441,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872248618&doi=10.5846%2fstxb201203290441&partnerID=40&md5=f6449a0e84a6cd06bc118c0878b4b949

Because the effect of habitat isolation proved detrimental on habitat populations, priority shifted to connecting habitats both large and small. The premise was that many different habitats joined together would lead to an increase in landscape function and suitability of habitat for wildlife. The targeted region for this case study was the Pikes Peak Region of Colorado.

This extreme form of land use alteration has affected species composition and abundance, moulding a few species to dominate the urban environment and a few others to extinction. Urbanisation occurs at different scales and the community composition of species gets affected accordingly. In this paper, we look into species richness and abundance of birds, and their variation along an urban-rural gradient at Tiruchirappalli, India. In Tiruchirappalli, bird species diversity increases from more to less urbanised centres. Though diversity is less in urban areas, the abundance of species occupying these areas is higher. During this study, the maximum recorded birds were omnivores. The most affected species is the House Sparrow, with a few populations residing in the urban environment. Along the urban-rural gradient, farmlands and wetlands are the most preferred landscapes of birds, and conservation measures need to be oriented in this direction to protect the most vulnerable species. Species diversity in urban areas is significantly contributed to by edge species that occupy the fringes of urban areas. Though urban landscapes are less species rich, they too play a significant role in biodiversity conservation as they are species abundant zones. City planners and urban foresters need to pay more attention towards preserving habitats not only in urban areas but along the urban fringes, as they provide suitable corridors for various activities of birds and their movement. © Bombay Natural History Society 2012.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882988793&partnerID=40&md5=6e02f81761913148715a4c8726c4a962,Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society,3,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882988793&partnerID=40&md5=6e02f81761913148715a4c8726c4a962

Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, . Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (. n=. 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2. h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.biocon.2012.06.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863825867&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2012.06.007&partnerID=40&md5=4ea166ff84b8e39685cdf8276fcaca1f,Biological Conservation,2,10.1016/j.biocon.2012.06.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863825867&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2012.06.007&partnerID=40&md5=4ea166ff84b8e39685cdf8276fcaca1f

Our results show that bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments.

Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e. g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s11252-011-0193-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82655174003&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-011-0193-4&partnerID=40&md5=a255200b20dce6e0baad896b4a7008e8,Urban Ecosystems,2,10.1007/s11252-011-0193-4,https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/2011/ja_2011_trammell_001.pdf; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20123132847; https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/42147; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-011-0193-4; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20123132847.html; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11252-011-0193-4

To differentiate the potential effectiveness of 2 frequently used strategies for increasing the connectivity of populations in fragmented landscapes-corridors and stepping stones-we combined 3 complimentary methods: behavioral studies at habitat edges, mark-recapture, and genetic analyses. Each of these methods addresses different steps in the dispersal process that a single intensive study could not address. We applied the 3 methods to the case study ofAtrytonopsisnew species 1, a rare butterfly endemic to a partially urbanized stretch of barrier islands in North Carolina (U.S.A.). Results of behavioral analyses showed the butterfly flew into urban and forested areas, but not over open beach; mark-recapture showed that the butterfly dispersed successfully through short stretches of urban areas (<500 m); and genetic studies showed that longer stretches of forest (>5 km) were a dispersal barrier, but shorter stretches of urban areas (≤5 km) were not. Although results from all 3 methods indicated natural features in the landscape, not urbanization, were barriers to dispersal, when we combined the results we could determine where barriers might arise: forests restricted dispersal for the butterfly only when there were long stretches with no habitat. Therefore, urban areas have the potential to become a dispersal barrier if their extent increases, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if we had used a single approach. Protection of stepping stones should be sufficient to maintain connectivity forAtrytonopsisnew species 1 at current levels of urbanization.

Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence. 2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species. 3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack. 4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leaf-miner abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements. 5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants. Parasitism may be affected by distance from the corridor rather than physical barriers or other potential hosts. © 2011 The Authors.

Global climate change adds to the gravity of these effects. An ecological network describes a network of habitats and connecting corridors that is mapped using habitat suitability and land use/ land cover data. Connectivity within a habitat network ensures a flow of material, energy and information among the various patches, and allows species-movement from inappropriate to appropriate areas. This ensures the abundance of species reaches a dynamic equilibrium at the network level and also means that the disappearance of species from any particular patch does not change the function of the regional ecosystem network. Thus, management of ecological network is an effective measure to counter the loss of biodiversity caused by reductions in habitat quality and area, as well as habitat fragmentation, in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change. The least cost path method is a way to construct and analyze ecological networks based on landscape spatial structure and dynamic biological processes. Based on the understanding that the characteristic of the matrix is one of the important factors determining the movement of species between patches, the least cost path method gives different cost values to different landscape types, and generates a cost surface to substitute the Euclidean space. Therefore, the dispersal paths generated by the least cost method are similar to those of actual species movement. Qingdao city is located in the eastern coastal region of China where the economy is relatively well-developed. The region is also where marine and terrestrial ecosystems meet. In this paper, we propose a wetland ecological network in the Qingdao district based on remote sensing and geographic information systems technology. We evaluate the overall structure of the network and the importance of individual patches using the correlation length index and betweenness centrality index, and use the findings to identify optimal strategies and make recommendations. In this paper, we discuss the following five questions: (1) How to classify landscapes? (2) How to determine the cost value of each landscape type? (3) How to evaluate the importance of each core patch? (4) How to evaluate the importance of stepping stones? (5) What is optimal management strategy for the wetland systems in the study area? The result shows that the network connectivities are very different in terms of threshold levels of path cost. Core patches in Jiao Zhou bay wetlands and Da Gu river have a relatively high degree of importance. Stepping stone patches with a high degree of importance are found in two zones: one comprising Jiao Zhou bay, Jiao Lai river and Wei He river estuary, and the other comprising Jiao Zhou bay and Ding Zi bay.

However, due to rapid urbanization, large habitat patches have become increasingly fragmented, and are almost like an island surrounded by the built-up area. The connectivity among these habitat patches is gradually waning. Changes in land use around these large patches have very strong impacts and seriously threaten regional biodiversity conservation. Habitat fragmentation would lead to smaller and more isolated animal populations and the isolated populations are more vulnerable to local extinction and inbreeding depression. An Ecological network is a representation of the biotic interaction in an ecosystem while ecological network planning is a method that combines fragmented habitat patches to form landscapes with spatial integrity and habitat networks. This method can help raise the quality of natural ecosystems and protect biodiversity. Thus, the establishment of ecological networks and the restoration of the links between isolated habitat patches would be quite beneficial to ecosystem services. In this paper, based on the theory and principles of Landscape Ecology and Conservation Biology, taking urban agglomeration in Hunan Province as the example, the potential ecological corridors were quantitatively simulated using the Least-Cost Path and Scenario Analysis Methods with the help of Remote Sensing and GIS technology. The strength of the interaction between green patches was then evaluated quantitatively based on the Gravity model. The impacts of the result of potential ecological networks by the cost surface were also analyzed. Finally, suggestions on how to optimize the ecological network were accordingly put forward. This paper tried to answer the following three questions: (1) what are the potential ecological corridors of urban agglomeration in Hunan Provence and how to determine the relative importance of these ecological corridors scientifically? (2) how to optimize the constructed ecological networks for better maintenance of regional biodiversity?

Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0. 99km2), Michigan (mean = 1. 34km2), Nebraska (mean = 1. 20km2), and Wisconsin (mean = 1. 47km2) did not differ across the region (F3,175 = 0. 42, P = 0. 737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape. Connectivity of selected forested regions within agro-forested ecosystems across the Midwest plays a greater role in understanding the size of home ranges than traditional definitions of deer habitat conditions and landscape configuration. © United States Department of Agriculture/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service/Wildlife Services 2009.",10.1007/s10980-009-9374-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76349122015&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-009-9374-4&partnerID=40&md5=22e0325fc89b0169fa61e9c96351390b,Landscape Ecology,11,10.1007/s10980-009-9374-4,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103054943; http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/publications/09pubs/walter092.pdf; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdm_usdanwrc/843/; https://core.ac.uk/display/17233148; https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/regional-assessment-on-influence-of-landscape-configuration-and-c; https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/regional-assessment-on-influence-of-landscape-configuration-and-c; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10980-009-9374-4; https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/ClarkW/docs/17Walteretal20091.pdf; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1839&context=icwdm_usdanwrc; https://core.ac.uk/download/17233148.pdf

Conversion of natural areas to land dominated by human use results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment or even extinction. Recently, reserve site selection models have begun to integrate spatial attributes in order to design more compact and connected reserve networks that are thought to improve long-term species persistence. While these models are a good step forward to designing conservation reserve networks, they might not be adequate for use in exurban areas that consist of heterogeneous mosaics of land uses where habitat fragmentation already exists and not all parcels are available for preservation. This paper presents a species conservation framework that expands upon traditional reserve site selection models in three ways. First, because of the focus on exurban areas, the framework used here allows for land conversion within core habitat patches. Second, the framework provides a more robust assessment of connectivity among patches by accounting for land-use heterogeneity in the dispersal matrix. And third, the framework explicitly incorporates species population dynamics. We apply our conservation framework to the case of pond-breeding salamanders in an exurban community in Rhode Island, USA. Comparisons are made between the outcomes for uniform conservation policies and more flexible policies that accommodate ecological and economic heterogeneity. As expected, policies that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process are less costly in terms of foregone development. Conservation planners should consider core habitat patches, dispersal matrix, and spatial scale in their decision making. By not assessing the potential impact of dispersal barriers, reserve site selection models will result in conservation plans that may not protect species over the long term, particularly for species residing in highly fragmented landscapes such as those found in many exurban communities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e.g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e.g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity.

We assessed the effect of this projected land-use change scenario on five forest rodent species at three scales: using occupancy models at the patch level, proportional occupancy models at the landscape level, and ecologically scaled landscape indices to assess the change in connectivity at the watershed level. At the patch and landscape scales, occupancy models had low predictability but suggest that gray squirrels are most susceptible to land-use change. At the watershed scale, declines in connectivity did not correspond with the decline of forest.

In instances where conflicts have occurred land managers have been licensed to remove nests and eggs and cull adults at a site scale. With the increase in urban populations and local management of the species, there is a need to understand how ibis are using urban resources and how they move through the urban landscape to identify important resources. To gain a better understanding of the connectedness of local urban populations, we fitted 82 birds with radio transmitters at three common habitats: an urban park, a breeding colony and a landfill. Over a period of 48 weeks we found 45% of birds made movements greater than 10. km, with 13% moving greater than 30. km. Ibis were located at up to nine foraging and seven roost sites, demonstrating the connectedness of the population across the study region. Landfills were identified as a major food resource with 63% of ibis (n = 82) located therein, while parks supported local foraging with only 27% of ibis (n = 82) located therein. Our results indicate that ibis showed site fidelity but also interacted on a regional scale within approximately 40. km of their colonies. Accordingly, conservation planning for this species needs to be assessed on a regional basis, not on a localized case-by-case basis.

The quantitative evidences showed that there was a net increase of 8.57% in total water patch areas as an overall change between 1998 and 2006. The fragmentation of the water decreased as indicated by the larger areas and smaller numbers of patches. Analysis of the metrics revealed that water structure in study area had changed better over the past 8 years in terms of spatial configuration. The coverage of forest becomes larger indicated by the increases of woodland areas. The revegetations of the riparian would be helpful to the soil and water conservation. The proportion of agricultural land patch decreased by 35.72%, which would be responsible for the mitigation of water quality deterioration. The fragmentation of riparian decreased in landscape level, and the structural connectivity improved. The changes of woodland, farmland and the connectivity would place positive effects to the restoration of stream. The increasing urbanization indicated by a series of indices' changes such as the increases of PLAND and LSI and so on, which would bring new challenges to water quality. Dramatic changes of the landscapes, which due to the spread of urban land use around the riparian, may hold a negative influence over the restoration of stream. On all accounts, the restoration of Dongjiang River riparian gained effects to some extent, but some aspects should be enhanced. The optimization of vegetation is especially emphasized, and the spatial allocation of vegetation and plant species composition should be improved. The ecological particularity of riparian should be considered in the urban planning. Where water restoration is the goal, integrative measures at the landscape scale are supposed to be adopted. It is suggested that the distributing configuration of landscape pattern was ought to be optimized, and reinforcing the integration of multiple factors, so as to draw appropriate lessons for water ecosystem management.",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-59049102547&partnerID=40&md5=d776b92619883c69fae4a1e2bc25086f,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,3,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-59049102547&partnerID=40&md5=d776b92619883c69fae4a1e2bc25086f

For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Until recently, limited consideration has been given to modelling the effects of the landscape context (e.g. habitat area, habitat configuration and roads). Yet, the combined influence of natural habitats and anthropogenic impacts at multiple spatial scales are likely to be important determinants of where koala populations occur and remain viable in human-modified landscapes. The study tested the importance of multiscale habitat variables on koala occurrence in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The models focused at three spatial scales: site (< 1 ha), patch (1-100 ha), and landscape (100-1000 s ha). Logistic regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses were used to rank alternative models and key explanatory variables. The results showed that an increased likelihood of koala presence in fragmented landscapes in the urban-forest interface (as opposed to larger blocks of forest habitat) can best be explained by the positive effects of soil fertility and the presence of preferred koala tree species in these fragmented areas. If koalas are to be effectively conserved in Ballarat, it is critical to (i) protect remaining core areas of high-quality habitat, including regenerating areas; (ii) protect scattered habitat patches which provide connectivity; and (iii) develop and implement habitat restoration programmes to improve habitat connectivity and enhance opportunities for safe koala movement between habitat patches intersected by main roads. © 2008 Ecological Society of Australia.",10.1111/j.1442-8903.2008.00405.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48249154580&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-8903.2008.00405.x&partnerID=40&md5=96d5221564320a8819421d5763d86aa5,Ecological Management and Restoration,7,10.1111/j.1442-8903.2008.00405.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48249154580&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-8903.2008.00405.x&partnerID=40&md5=96d5221564320a8819421d5763d86aa5

How has this large, slow-moving reptile managed to persist in the suburbs? We implanted radio-transmitters into 17 adult blue-tongued lizards and tracked them for six months (October 1998 to March 1999). Radio-tracked animals utilised 5-17 suburban backyards, but each lizard spent most of its time in a few 'core' areas near 2-7 shelter sites. Males had larger home ranges than females (mean of 12700 v. 5100 m2) and moved further between shelter sites. Gravid females (mean home range 1000 m2) were more sedentary. Lizards used corridors of dense vegetation to move between retreat sites, and actively avoided crossing roads. In sunny weather, lizards typically basked close to their overnight shelter for 1-4 h each morning until they obtained body temperatures of approximately 32°C. They maintained high body temperatures while moving about in the afternoon. In combination, the following ecological factors may facilitate persistence of blue-tongued lizards at our suburban study sites. (i) The most important subgroup of the population in terms of conservation are gravid females, which are highly sedentary and, thus, less likely to encounter the dangers of suburbia. (ii) The more 'expendable' males move about much more, but mostly in times and places that involve minimal risk from humans and their domestic pets. (iii) Lizards show strong site fidelity, spending up to 70% of their time in 'safe' locations; importantly, they avoid roads. (iv) Blue-tongued lizards readily utilise 'artificial' shelter sites and the commensal prey species (e.g. snails) found in most gardens. (v) These lizards can grow rapidly, mature early, and produce large litters. Because blue-tongued lizards have a long life span (over 30 years in captivity), populations of adults may persist for many years in the absence of recruitment.",10.1071/wr00068,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034877952&doi=10.1071%2fwr00068&partnerID=40&md5=53101156cd9d05c8553296852b500ebd,Wildlife Research,3,10.1071/wr00068,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034877952&doi=10.1071%2fwr00068&partnerID=40&md5=53101156cd9d05c8553296852b500ebd

The object was to provide a comprehensive method to study urban forest structure and its function in environmental improvement. The results showed that there were 5 major landscape elements, i.e., building and hard pavement surface, water, road, urban forest, and general green land in the area. The landscape matrix was building and pavement surface, occupied 73.13 % of total land. Road was the typical corridor element in the city and occupied 6.89%. Green land occupied 11.44 %, in which, urban forest patch occupied 9.18 %. There were 408 urban forest patches, with an area of 161.16 hm2. The average area of the patch was 0.396 hm2, and the maximum area was 12 hm2, 48 % of urban forest patch was identified as small scale patches with < 500 m2 of area, and only 8.6 % of them was larger than 1 hm2. The number of general green land patch was 255, with an area of 39.74 hm2, which accounted for 2.26 % of land area, and its average and maximum area was 0.1558 hm2 and 3.86 hm2, respectively. There were 147 water patches, with an area of 149.93 hm2, and occupied 8.54 % of land, and the average and maximum area of the patch was 1.02 hm2 and 16 hm2, respectively. In the study area, both of the Shannon-Weiner landscape diversity index and evenness were low, only 0.928 and 0.576, respectively. In addition, the dominance of urban forest patch and general green land was 0.39, showing that the two landscape elements had a certain influence on the environment of the study area. The concept of interior habitat for forest was introduced in this paper, which was employed to make a scale class system of urban forest patch. The threshold area with interior habitat for urban forest patch was 9800m2, and there was 31.69hm2 of interior habitat of urban forest in total, which occupied 19.7 % of the total area of urban forest patch.

It's suggested that the concept of interior habitat could be employed to identify urban forest patch, and a scale system of small scale patch of urban forest-middle patch-large patch-extra large patch was build in the paper. Based on this system, the ratio of different scales of urban forest patch in the study area should be 2:2:2:3.

In such models, the occurrences of focal species are related to habitat and landscape variables, which in urbanising areas should also include effects of urban disturbances. Moreover, the accuracy of the spatial predictive models may be affected by spatial autocorrelation, which means that a part of the variance is explained by neighbouring values. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat and disturbance patterns on the distribution of two forest grouse species, Tetrao urogallus and Bonasa bonasia, and to detect and model the effects of spatial autocorrelation. The distribution of the two species could be explained in terms of reduction of a main predator, habitat quality, quantity and connectivity, including urban disturbances. The residuals of the initial regressions showed positive spatial autocorrelation that could be quantified by using a spatial probit model. The application of the spatial probit model revealed strongly significant spatial dependencies for both species. Furthermore, the model fit could be increased for T. urogallus by applying this model. The results implied that both species distributions might be affected by both reactions to the underlying land-use pattern, but also by interaction with neighbours. The use of the spatial probit model is a way to incorporate spatial interactions that otherwise cannot be captured by the independent variables. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets.

We evaluated how three factors influenced the abundance of mammalian nest predators in thirty-four 300-m long forested greenway segments in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA: (1) the width of the forested corridor containing the greenway, (2) the land-use adjacent to the forested corridor, and (3) the habitat structure within the greenway. Forest corridor width and adjacent land-use were measured using aerial photographs. Attributes of adjacent land use included categorical measures of development intensity (low-density residential, high-density residential, office/institutional), and the proportions of forest canopy, grass, buildings, and pavement. Several measures of habitat structure within the greenway were collected in the field, including trail width and surface type, and percentage of mature forest. We measured the relative abundance of mammalian nest predators with scent-station transects, operated for five nights during the 2002 breeding bird season. Total abundance of mammalian nest predators increased significantly as forest corridor width decreased. We found no relationship between categorical measures of land-use and total abundance of mammalian nest predators. Specific attributes of the landscape adjacent to the greenway, however, did have an effect. Greenways adjacent to landscapes with fewer buildings had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators. The abundance of individual species varied with the amount of canopy, lawn, and pavement in the adjacent landscape. Some measures of habitat structure of greenways also were correlated with the abundance of mammalian nest predators. Greenway segments with wider trails had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators, as did segments with a higher percentage of mature forest. No habitat structure variables were significant for all species. To reduce the overall risk of avian nest predation by mammals, forested greenways should be designed with wider forest corridors and narrower, unpaved trails. Some greenway characteristics that favor high-nest predator populations also favor birds of conservation concern. Similarly, some characteristics correlated with lower predator occurrence are also correlated with lower abundance of birds of conservation concern. Thus, management of greenways and the surrounding landscape must balance reduction of predator communities with the promotion of desired bird communities and other conservation goals. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were the most abundant of the 13 species observed and were the only ducks remaining during the nesting season. Habitat size and complexity were important factors influencing the species diversity of a particular site.

Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas. The composition of the riparian zone and floodplain habitat affects the foraging and activity of riparian specialist British bats and should be considered when designing landscape-scale conservation schemes that include British rivers.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827870110?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=CuBJf%2BWAFNfEgIAOecJNmI%2Fp91c%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827870110?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=8rNA2HpIuTQ10oHZTnb1bSVQ4X4%3D

These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to ""pristine"" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not. Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert. In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists.

Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building.

Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal. In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2695015697?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=IJhLeeBBVlI%2B7Pmeg0P6Ycxjljo%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2695015697?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=i6Xwc6aJJn43GAdsVMrFzqYrppE%3D

Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2160960096?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=9QK0eyBPArVmcd40gh%2BplGF4Wcc%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2160960096?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=VvOpZISPjvb22plG%2BU%2BVMO2UM8E%3D

Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior.

Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers. Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1925000206?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=2kazSeM9d7Z8CwoTAvRH31VlP%2B4%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1925000206?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=UXzBWHm0jFbBfq1IcNbG6wdiNSk%3D

It integrates issues of environmental concern, for example, biodiversity and ecological health, with the practices of a sample of urban dwellers. Private backgardens and public urban green spaces (parkettes) in the Greater Toronto Area were sampled and compared with respect to plant diversity and environmental heterogeneity. With a greater number of microhabitats and higher plant species richness than public parkettes, private backgardens were found to be remarkable hotspots of biodiversity and environmental heterogeneity. A backgarden microcosm experiment looked at the interaction of structural features of backgardens and the incidental recruitment of invertebrates, seeds, and plants. These small supplements of space served as habitats for recruitment of plants and seeds as it was determined that invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment and above-ground vegetation growth were enhanced regardless of soil or grass substrate treatment in microcosms. Backgarden characteristics, specifically the number of woody plants (trees and shrubs) and the number of plant species significantly predicted seed recruitment and winged invertebrate visitation, respectively, to microcosms. Lastly, a spatial analysis evaluated local and regional green space composition and heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Nearly 74% of the Greater Toronto Area is comprised of green space, however, more than 50% is made up of low vegetation (i.e., grass and herbaceous ground cover). Approximately 8% of the urban landscape was appraised as private backgardens; 6% of the urban landscape, conservatively, was estimated as backgarden green space. The percent green space composition of backgardens differed between neighbourhoods, and based on different human population densities, while neighbours were found to be statistically similar in their backgarden percent green space composition. This research study thus promotes citizen science and ecological practices within backgardens to enhance urban biodiversity and regional green space connectivity.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305039343?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=7baijv6yem80BDrQ3BwE50vRwvI%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305039343?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=53qvFFbVAje8R%2BkrZh1WQ8ZcR9s%3D

In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes. First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors. In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304962999?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=XEpbelyteAT%2BUzC9WxciQn8Aoqc%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304962999?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wXaz8ri0xk2zE9DDsdPps7y1u10%3D

Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700377060?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=ol1BrU5F2%2FxDeFXMUNuGu4JDW4Q%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700377060?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SNvnRXFa7RMX5V3lfgN8hBTwAKY%3D

As humans have developed, the patches and corridors have become fragmented and edges have been created. These edges become the critical points of interaction for wildlife with their surroundings. This is especially true in urban areas where development has created harsh edge environments. \\This study investigates the edge structure of Olmsted's Emerald Necklace to understand how edges can be designed to create habitat for wildlife in urban areas. The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones. The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways. These include protecting existing habitat, using native plants and eradicating invasive species. The results and findings are discussed in further detail.

Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment. Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness. Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority. The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent. Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others. Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size. In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes.

I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations.

Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses.

To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls. Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis. Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY. These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks. I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates. I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events. Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15. Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2. In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT. Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009. Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point. These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists. Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural. The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC. I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate, and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC. In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas. I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park. Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%. I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration. It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles. In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes. However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/931548247?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=NVNMbQCk0fjBFU7i%2FqPNLkWqaTg%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/931548247?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Uzz0070WuTRdluYWVCsAjkLIMIY%3D

I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species. I discuss the implications for hazel dormouse conservation in the UK, and make recommendations for conservation practitioners to ensure the future persistence of this species.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2410400563?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=OmMMLuPQSbRL%2Fn%2BR5LSCM99ES9k%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2410400563?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=S0jq6KVmaNjSGMtsKLPzI57eLOg%3D

Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors. Based on all the investigations and findings, suggestions have been made to improve the quality of SPUOS in Hong Kong.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2002215530?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=NbvzfBkJXofEPLywe4QQQMFdUIA%3D,Pqdt - Global,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2002215530?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=JTcRV%2FaXPmVe2XVRzhsgyCBrxVo%3D

Large carnivores like mountain lions ( Puma concolor) present a particular challenge to managers because of public safety and the polarizing emotional reactions to human-lion encounters. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment. Preserving movement corridors for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining landscape connectivity to ensure viable populations adjacent to urban areas. Because mountain lion habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona and lions traverse large landscapes, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences their life history characteristics and ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study was to examine the ecology and spatial movements of mountain lions surrounding urban areas.

These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2164566508?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=%2BMcHMhTVtgqEVXafuZWeNGdXlD8%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2164566508?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=r5yuplT9gMgyygz6tqwOTuoYDt4%3D

Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440362827?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=YrEDFEZkxDudfftCMIPTaMCxz%2Bk%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440362827?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ZtUTWmkVzf2v3tzRgH9gm9j5%2BmM%3D

Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values. These results emphasize the need for species-specific data to inform management and conservation planning, and also contribute to a growing body of work on the landscape associations and multiple dispersal strategies of pond-breeding amphibians globally.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304894936?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=nmRZo1ckK7n6h5xzUNMFaFAhbf4%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304894936?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=p4NFSrpc7tF5CmmT%2BRO9xbjx%2FaQ%3D

As to the third characteristic, the developments referred to the increase of plant biodiversity, the changes in life form spectrum, and the diversity of ecological structure and functions. The flora and species composition of trees, the frequency of commonly used trees and the applications of native trees in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were analyzed.

The main results are as follows:1. 150 species were recorded.Based on sensitivities to urbanization and edge, and distributing in how many kinds of habitat, they were divided into 12 urban landscape habitat distributional guilds.2. The distributions of birds over urban woodlots were nonrandom. There was imperfect nested subset pattern in community assemblages. The heterogeneity between woodlots was the cause of the departure from perfect nested subset pattern.3.The species-area relationships of woodlot bird communities were the results of action of multi-factors, which included: the effect of different sample size (under the same sample size, the small woodlots have higher species density than large one), the habitat diversity (the diversity of tree species was the uppermost influencing factor), disturbance factors, species factors and the effect of different research scales etc.4. There were substantial turnover and distinct seasonal changes in woodlot bird communities. The overall stability of woodlot bird community was low. 5. Street tree strips had extensive ecological functions, they served birds not only as the roosting and feeding sites, but also the corridor of movement.6. The characteristics of distributions of bird communities from the edges of the city zone to the forest interior were misty. Species number, diversity and abundance had a great fluctuation along the linear space. They were correlated with the random distributions of heterogeneous features in western mountain.7. Edge effect could result in not only increasing of diversity, but also decreasing of diversity, it depended on the characteristics of the edge. Edge effect was transformable in time.8. With urban expansion, rare and interior species, waterbirds and insectivore declined. Meanwhile,some species showed limited adaptation to urbanization.9. Landscape habitats were correlative in space, and the factors influencing communities usually be at different scales. The diversity at definite scale correlated nearly with the heterogeneity at a definite scale.10. Urban bird community in Hangzhou was cognized as a landscape metacommunity.

Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=7NFv1Pi6wm2fNzn9QDv1fTWyfQ4%3D,Pqdt - Global,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1024557256?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=qSbDwCa4x79cWRIkSQZqmwYSkcg%3D

Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305049306?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=De%2FxCmYkyWXVR3o8ZTwQWcPb%2BKI%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/305049306?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=mvxzJ8pn9l5i9P%2FePfofXnqPwgs%3D

There is rising concern over human wildlife conflict and its effects on human and animal wellbeing. Investigation into the biophysical and social landscape features that shape conflict or how spatial patterns in conflict ultimately affect species’ movement or survival is limited. Characterizing landscape connectivity and identifying potential movement corridors is a key conservation strategy, but is challenged by the fact that many wildlife species navigate a mosaic of infrastructure, available habitat, land uses, and political boundaries. In this thesis, I investigated the social and biophysical factors that contribute to conflict with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and how this conflict may impact connectivity for bears across southern British Columbia and northern Washington. I selected this system due to its rich cultural history with grizzly bear biological and social complexity. The region has current grizzly bear populations, extirpated areas, state/provincial and international boundaries, diverse land uses, and a variety of social values towards wildlife. I used two resource selection approaches to first determine the probability of conflict reporting across all wildlife species, and then to determine the probability of bear conflict specifically. First, I used presence and background sampling in combination with Bayesian logistic regression to identify important predictors of conflict across species using 5,606 reported instances of conflict and 8,703 background points. Then, I fit a second regression treating 2,062 bear conflict occurrences as presence points and 3,544 instances of other conflict as absences to characterize how bear conflict might differ from wildlife conflict in general.I found that predictors of conflict differed between species and that the probability of general wildlife conflict was substantially different than the probability of bear conflict across the study system. The strongest predictors of conflict for all species were human population density and both livestock and row-crop operation density. The strongest predictors of bear conflict were public opinion of bears, proximity to existing grizzly bear populations, and suitable bear habitat. Generating spatial predictions on these models indicates that the urban centers of the Okanagan (e.g., Kelowna, Vernon) are hotspots for general wildlife conflict while the semi-urban and rural agriculture landscapes (e.g., outside Penticton and along the US and Canada border) are hotspots for bear conflict (Chapter 1). I then incorporated spatial predictions of the probability of bear conflict into the resistance surface for a connectivity model across the traditional territory of the Sylix people to investigate how spatial patterns of conflict may impact bear movement and the ability to recolonize the traditional Sylix territory. I used Omniscape to model connectivity as a function of biophysical variables to identify the most likely available movement pathways and compared this to model outputs that incorporated the probability of conflict into the resistance surface to determine the effects of conflict on grizzly bear connectivity. My research highlights the role that social and institutional variables play in conflict and how these effects may differ between species. Further, my results illustrate the potential for conflict to constrain wildlife movement and highlight the need to treat connectivity conservation as a socio-ecological issue rather than just an ecological one.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2728995676?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=LAmLpNsXJ%2B9eawEgDMbOhZFCo6I%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2728995676?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=n3ejMpU%2FTgp%2FBTP1crIyr3%2BPBsk%3D

This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312380692?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=KkcRFW4uOZz97WLnCgdhOlKqf4s%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312380692?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=4lSlLS0IjAQkhp8wZDmekAZ9%2FfA%3D

(BL: DXN068471)",Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,NA,NA,"Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites.  Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats.  Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors.  At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken.  A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted. The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species.  Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate. A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists. These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation.  Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/301551548?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=95PIkv7nb79cACMkwXSRQfT0thc%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,1,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/301551548?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=aKQZs%2BvWdxP97zfoeLDNPhmce6U%3D

R.",2015,The distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,NA,NA,"Urbanisation is a key driver in the loss, fragmentation and modification of natural habitats resulting in the global loss of biodiversity. As the human population, and consequently the rate of urbanisation, continues to increase exponentially it is important to understand how to sustain and enhance biodiversity within the built environment. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet relatively little is known of how its composition and spatial configuration can influence species presence or foraging activities. It is therefore necessary to examine habitat use and biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales to fully understand how species are responding to the urban matrix. There are few other orders of animals that are as strongly associated with people as bats (Chiroptera); for some bat species human habitations provide roosts and adaptations of the environment provide food sources. However bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation indicating that many species are not able to persist in highly urbanised areas. In this thesis, I show that the behaviour, habitat preferences, and distribution of bats are strongly influenced by the built environment at both a local and landscape scale. Although many animal species are known to exhibit sex differences in habitat use, adaptability to the urban landscape is commonly examined at the species level without consideration of potential intraspecific differences. I found that female Pipistrellus pygmaeus show greater selectivity in foraging locations within urban woodland in comparison to males at both a local and landscape scale. There was a lower probability of finding females within woodlands which were poorly connected, highly cluttered, with a high edge: interior ratio and fewer mature trees. The results have important implications for our understanding of how to manage areas for breeding females and highlight the need to supplement acoustic monitoring with trapping data to assess sex differences in habitat use. Determining how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The morphological similarities between P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus suggest that both species should respond similarly to the urban matrix, however I found differential habitat use occurring within a variety of urban habitats (e.g. woodland and waterways) and at a landscape scale. In urban woodland there was a higher probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats yet we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. After surveying urban waterways throughout the UK, I was able to show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of bat species from the riparian zone up to 3km from a waterway. This indicates that beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales, from retaining a vegetated riparian zone at the local scale to highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes that encompass the entire urban matrix. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species such as bats. I was able to demonstrate a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency (e.g. the use of an acoustic lure to increase bat-capture rate) and a significant relationship between bat activity and the relative abundance of certain species of bat which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area whilst minimising wildlife disturbances. Urbanisation has also had strong negative effects on many insect groups, such as moths, which are important components of the diets of many bat species. I found that woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscapes in determining the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages within urban woodland. This indicates that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be more beneficial for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. The findings presented in this thesis have important implications for our understanding of the adaptability of species to the built environment and for the management and monitoring of bat populations. It also highlights that even common bat species are negatively affected by urbanisation and much greater attention should be paid to securing their future within the urban landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827522179?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=IzagFPeITB8lwFUZk3nbO4RQAII%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,1,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1827522179?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=CdQXNWtlJhpg%2B4yHfXeyEkZUw7g%3D

Movement of host species plays a key role in maintaining transmission of direct-contact disease. Understanding how wildlife hosts move in fragmented urban landscapes is therefore imperative for disease control efforts. In cities, disease spread can be affected by the ability of a host to move through urban features, or by behavioural changes that are pathogen induced. Using the urban-adapted red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its associated disease sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in the city of Toronto, I ask: How does movement of foxes according to landcover type affect the spread of mange? And how does variable movement of susceptible and infected foxes influence mange transmission? These questions are addressed using an individual-based modeling approach, where two movement behaviours of foxes in a city are compared: random and least-cost path. To assess the effects of movement ability according to disease status (here, susceptible-biased, and infected-biased movement), I compare a range of movement probabilities. For each scenario, the number of effective contacts and the effective reproduction number (Re) are estimated. Findings suggest that mange spread may be accelerated when movement is based on landcover types and when there is equal movement ability of susceptible and infected foxes. This study emphasizes the importance of including realistic movement behaviours when modelling the dynamics of mange and disease spread in urbanized landscapes.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2645199751?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=Oy3D19UmNquQp12yvDHF4ncvPR8%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2645199751?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=4OiB1cCBXpsuYniRsHEYOYLGjt0%3D

Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied. This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors. The results show that Wuhan’s all kind of green corridors in each district, especially the green belts, are very scanty. The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1027911982?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=Xn5RjDaPY6VWaMSx9FjnDSx7enw%3D,Pqdt - Global,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1027911982?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Cii1P2m%2FqHJZhlOoLqWF2%2BKFFv8%3D

Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304984667?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=3r1DQ5XUiBZ1bF8rmTszshL2rHM%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304984667?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=EMz9YS8d5mPbXZzFjBca%2Bg7Cx28%3D

By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468723947?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=bOzUkOEQHWMoQMyeorr9E4AYcIw%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468723947?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=9uHBs6YOh69lwOyMSgmKiJQlJk8%3D

Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region.Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable.Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species. I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles. Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions. Although the increasing threats to biodiversity conservation are well documented, strategies such as those presented here may help facilitate positive conservation outcomes.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1873090134?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=GaPowT1FsiQewU%2FEAR33YRmiTw0%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1873090134?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=EIAFxgEZTsq1uyjSY20I00KNoWQ%3D

I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304900787?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=2wrh%2BqBAl%2FBqvNVQAqpEa6FR144%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304900787?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=KP6j6WgMllPTHvdI90vRzQsnXhE%3D

Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2551569727?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=XrWoAQnPX4LJFgGOMccJDdDkchM%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2551569727?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=LjAvT6Yj1uKq6a8bBFZiPV1PNDo%3D
4088,drew2,MAYBE,JOUR,Bradfer-Lawrence and Tom_2019_Pqdt-UkandIreland,Bradfer-Lawrence and Tom,2019,Avian Communities and Ecoacoustics in a Tropical Human-Modified Landscape,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,NA,NA,"Large areas of the tropics have been cleared of forest and converted to agriculture. The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440353937?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=A4qoaEY5VY4VubKV9WEcNgg6vr8%3D,Pqdt - Uk and Ireland,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440353937?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Pm6HbgWnT9KGzxAlj0tVhQhVBeM%3D

Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1548325831?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=En1bevLin7wK4eURjyDp85Te85g%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1548325831?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=3piS7a5w4rq87RxNffCNzpr7B2g%3D

A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels.

However, the underlying mechanisms that influence headwater wetlands in urban landscapes are poorly understood. Further, biodiversity loss may reduce ecosystem function and increase the transmission risk for some enzootic diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). My research aimed to: 1) assess wetland vegetation structure and the importance of fragment size and landscape position on biodiversity; 2) test the importance of flooding conditions for mitigating invasive plant dominance in forested wetlands using Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) as my study system; and 3) identify relationships between vegetation structure, fragment size, and the relative abundance of competent avian WNV hosts and mosquito vectors. I used a combination of measurative and experimental research methods to address these objectives, the third of which was part of a collaborative interdisciplinary research grant. Vegetation structure was measured in 36 plots located in six forested wetlands and data loggers were used to monitor aboveground flooding. Avian and mosquito research teams coordinated iii with my sampling points. My results illustrate the capacity for urban headwater wetlands to support a diverse flora, as well as the complex interactions between human activities and wetland structure and function. Red maple, oak, sweetgum, and green ash were the dominant tree species. Half of the 287 plant species identified only occurred at 1-2 sample points. Groundcover composition reflected the confluence of hydrogeomorphology, and past and present human actions. Connectivity via nearby streams or ditches had a greater impact on exotic plant richness than did wetland patch size. Aboveground flooding prior to seedling emergence significantly reduced the distribution of Japanese stiltgrass. Avian species richness was positively correlated with plant richness. In contrast, mosquito richness was negatively correlated to plant richness. WNV hosts and vector abundance both increased with maple (Acer spp.) tree canopy dominance. Cumulative host abundance averaged 24% and was composed primarily of American Robin, which showed large interannual shifts in fragments <15 ha.

For chapter one, the objective was to evaluate the response of bats to urbanization across seasons. It was predicted that bat species would exhibit different responses to urbanization and that bats would increase use of urbanized areas in the summer season, where food and water resources were assumed to be greater. For chapter two, the objective was to evaluate species richness of bats across the gradient of urbanization in the summer season. Species richness of bats was predicted to either decrease linearly or peak at moderate levels of urban intensity. To test these hypotheses, 50 sites across the gradient of urbanization were sampled during four seasons using stationary acoustic bat monitors. Fourteen bat species were identified during 1000 nightly occasions. Consistent with chapter one predictions, bat species exhibited different responses to urbanization, with most bats being sensitive to urbanization. Counter to predictions, most bats did not appear to shift their response to urbanization across seasons. However, two bats (i.e., big brown bat and Yuma myotis) exhibited higher use of urbanized areas in the summer compared to other seasons. Consistent with chapter two predictions, species richness of bats decreased with increasing urban intensity. Results from this study demonstrate that most bats in the community were sensitive to urbanization, which is potentially related to species traits and has important conservation implications. First, it is likely important to maintain high-quality undeveloped habitat with low anthropogenic disturbance in wildland areas for species that are sensitive to urbanization and to maximize species richness. In addition, for bats that are tolerant of urbanization and to increase species richness in urbanized areas, it is likely important to preserve resources in urbanized areas and increase landscape connectivity.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2612075053?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=QCFzwrFQ87YLI3EMIYBdAP1AlWQ%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2612075053?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=44RYwDbtvMoE8pSQ9uEilJRIdlg%3D

To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use. My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat. Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1821391432?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=3WJZ0sRNut0BN53k9EFNGvZX1c8%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1821391432?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=Qs%2Fbgzwcb%2B%2FQM78HHeaLDYbtWjw%3D

As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores. In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes. In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1288376606?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=BYMM1d8OpxLIWx6R%2BUtgr0BT3Jc%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1288376606?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=ik0Vh3y5oOvyOtFYmjcDysupqog%3D

Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1439927159?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=m7hBEcwhcq4gKoEzd9RD%2Fv5U41c%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1439927159?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=wjS4I6bb8NYuXE7lmn%2FWztaFtkQ%3D

This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304251005?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=is6jzUoQgsLkmcGobDId4SF31RU%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304251005?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=15Emb%2BMyiPOdVt%2BU%2BDJpCia1%2Fso%3D

Over two decades have passed since the listing, with new information acquired and protection measures being in place to maximize the persistence potential of the species. Yet, the future of the species remains unclear as new threats emerge to negatively affect the species populations. In the southwestern United States, wildfires have increased in size and severity in many forests, and are expected to continue to increase with projected warmer and drier climate.

Protected areas, our primary approach to conservation, are often surrounded by land being used for agriculture or houses, which affects their conservation value. Considering current land use and identifying future threats is critical to effective conservation, both within protected areas and without. My dissertation goal was to assess threats to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) from land use change. To do this, I first quantified land use change around refuges under different economic policy scenarios. Second, I quantified and projected housing growth effects on structural habitat connectivity. Third, I projected changes in functional habitat connectivity under land use and climate change scenarios for Blanding's turtle, a species with limited dispersal ability. \\My primary result was that there will likely be significant land use change regardless of economic policy scenario. However, differences among scenarios were minor with the exception of restricting urban growth, which had stronger effects than other policies and preserved natural habitats as well as a policy specifically designed to preserve natural habitats. In addition, relying on habitat connectivity to mitigate the effects of global change is unlikely to be broadly effective because urban use has already precluded restoring connectivity for many refuges. In both of these cases, land use change patterns were strongly regional in nature. Finally, climate change had a stronger influence on changes in habitat connectivity than land use change for the Blanding's turtle, which demonstrated a ""trailing edge"" effect wherein populations at the southern edge of the range lost habitat connectivity more quickly than in the northern part of its range. My findings indicate that a single national policy is not workable without the flexibility to account for regional differences change, that conservation planning should occur at the ecoregional as well as the individual protected area level, and that protected areas managing for a single species should assess the effects of global change on their focal species and conservation goals.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1554684557?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=Uqi%2FXlJcHfv0ophFIc8SlEzCfKk%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1554684557?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=AufbrWfAK2LSSQ750K%2Bdp6jdYY8%3D

From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2508515451?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=hzMDVhFcqAYDakG%2BOCiU7F3TLsc%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2508515451?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=SKYF5GXLVe3%2BOG7v1pqW%2FBXEhYg%3D

China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted ""V"" type to ""# ""type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones.

This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley. This can be of importance for research on the impact of climate change. However, it is not yet clear if other rivers have a comparable corridor.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe.

Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat. A method to incorporate wetland habitat connectivity using a context-specific GIS is suggested.",NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304992302?accountid=9894&bdid=33923&_bd=C9f1ShkpB54Eel7Uhi8GQauL3ck%3D,Proquest Dissertations and Theses,2,NA,https://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?qurl=https://www.proquest.com/docview/304992302?accountid=9894&bdid=29285&_bd=rezWiQkz62tzYOzvSXwbhSqI39c%3D

Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-based models, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other non-target mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animal movement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data.

Dispersal through fragmented habitats is key for species to spread, persist in metapopulations and shift range in response to climate change. However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species. Objective To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland. Methods We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of oak processionary moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of ‘effective distance’ from the source (i.e. the patch ‘voltage’ in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012. Results We showed that ‘effective distance’ fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their ‘current’ and ‘power’ (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM. Conclusions Patches identified as ‘important’ are potential ‘pinch points’ and regions of high ‘flow’, where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection. This application of electric network theory can be used to inform landscape-scale conservation initiatives both to reduce the spread of invasives and to facilitate large-scale species’ range shifts in response to climate change.",10.1007/s10980-015-0168-6,https://paperity.org/p/59406465/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processionary-moth-thaumetopoea; http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/35995394/Cowley_Johnson_and_Pocock_2015.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processi; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20153194899.html; https://core.ac.uk/display/81088916; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153194899; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-015-0168-6.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/35995394/Cowley_Johnson_and_Pocock_2015.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processionary-moth-thaumetopoea-processionea-in-urban-woodland-patches(c11d9de6-5df5-422e-bf58-a7e57ec07eac).html; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-015-0168-6; https://core.ac.uk/download/33451821.pdf,Landscape Ecology,6,10.1007/s10980-015-0168-6,https://paperity.org/p/59406465/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processionary-moth-thaumetopoea; http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/35995394/Cowley_Johnson_and_Pocock_2015.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processi; https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20153194899.html; https://core.ac.uk/display/81088916; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153194899; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-015-0168-6.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/35995394/Cowley_Johnson_and_Pocock_2015.pdf; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/using-electric-network-theory-to-model-the-spread-of-oak-processionary-moth-thaumetopoea-processionea-in-urban-woodland-patches(c11d9de6-5df5-422e-bf58-a7e57ec07eac).html; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-015-0168-6; https://core.ac.uk/download/33451821.pdf

We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads.

The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production.

Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions.

For cities, the design of ‘green infrastructures’ or ‘nature-based solutions’ has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demand modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access of humans and no human design. We propose ‘Animal-Aided Design’ (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.",10.1101/150359,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/15/150359; https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR27997; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/15/150359.full.pdf; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/15/150359.full.pdf; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/150359v1,Na,4,10.1101/150359,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/15/150359.abstract

Urban densification aims to counteract urban sprawl; however, it threatens urban green spaces that act as sustainable alternative habitats for wildlife. In this study, we used the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) as a model species to develop sustainable planning recommendations for urban green spaces. Using species distribution models (SDMs) in combinations with high-resolution predicting variables (2 x 2 m grid cell), we defined the suitable habitat of a Common Redstart territory in a moderately urbanized environment. We then predicted how the distribution would be affected under realistic scenarios of land-use modification (termed conservation scenario and threat scenario) in an effort to provide recommendations for urban green space planning. Tree canopy cover was the principal land-cover type in the SDMs that explained the current species distribution followed by impervious surface and short-cut lawn. In the conservation scenario where tree canopy coverage was increased we predicted an increase in optimum habitat for the Common Redstart from 7% to 27% of the study area. In contrast, under a threat scenario based on urban densification, we predicted a decrease in the optimum habitat to only 4% of the study area.

However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats.

Here, we use an integrative approach to investigate the response of wild bees to urbanisation at the community, species, and individual levels. To do so, we sampled wild bees in 24 public parks along an urbanisation gradient in the Mediterranean city of Marseille. We found that species richness and abundance decreased in more urbanised areas, but increased in larger city parks. Moreover, larger individuals within species, but not larger species, were found in larger city parks, suggesting that park size is crucial for the persistence of bees in cities. Interestingly, we show that brighter species were found in parks surrounded by a large amount of impervious surface, highlighting the importance of colour traits in the response to environmental changes. Finally, our results revealed that larger species, but not larger individuals, were also more colourful. In summary, our study not only confirmed that urbanisation negatively impacts community-level traits, but that it also affects species’ coloration and individuals’ body size, thus improving our understanding of the functional response of wild bees to urbanisation. We suggest that increasing park size may compensate for the negative effects of urbanisation on wild bees.</jats:p>",10.1101/2022.12.09.519739,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/12/2022.12.09.519739.abstract,Na,20,10.1101/2022.12.09.519739,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/12/12/2022.12.09.519739.abstract

Most of the information on urban birds comes from studies carried out in the northern hemisphere, and they include data that don’t exceed three years. Although short-term studies contribute to knowledge about bird community diversity and their spatial distribution in urban areas, they could be biased towards more conspicuous and abundant species. One of the few multi-temporal datasets available for birds in urban areas is the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Using annual CBC data available between 2001 and 2018 from 21 urban and peri-urban sample sites assessed from the main cities of Colombia, we identified and analyzed long-term trends on the cumulative diversity of bird communities as well as on their spatial distribution. We estimated comparative trends in richness, abundance, similarity, and complementarity of avifauna for each city and sample site based on their responses to urbanization and dietary guilds. We identified almost a quarter of the species registered in Colombia (464 of 1954). The representativeness of the community obtained during 18 years exceeds 84%, showing richness that ranges between 214 and 278 species in the three cities. Bird species and individuals registered showed wide variation of the sample sites. We found more dwellers, insectivorous and granivorous species in urban areas, with frugivores relegated to peri-urban sites, usually coinciding with avoider species. Natural peri-urban areas and intra-urban wetlands and urban parks were the most important refuges for birds and maintained the highest avoider and utilizer species richness. Long-term inventories are fundamental for determining consolidated bird diversity and distributional patterns. This information established a baseline for decision-making and applying recommendations that allow reconciling the growing demand for urban areas with the need to preserve the native avifauna in megadiverse Neotropical countries such as Colombia.</jats:p>",10.1101/2022.07.27.501686,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/29/2022.07.27.501686.abstract,Na,6,10.1101/2022.07.27.501686,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/07/29/2022.07.27.501686.abstract

In this study we examined how greenways serve as distinct habitats in their own right by characterizing the vegetative structure of the Capital Area Greenway (CAG) in Raleigh, NC. We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments.

The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are “greenhouse” species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. Additionally, some similarity between roof and ground populations indicates dispersal from nearby ground habitats.

To test for such patterns, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived genetic data sets for North American birds and mammals. After filtering, we had usable raw genotype data from 85 studies and 41,023 individuals, sampled from 1,008 locations spanning 41 mammal and 25 bird species. We used census-based urban-rural designations, human population density, and the Human Footprint Index as measures of urbanization and habitat disturbance. As predicted, mammals sampled in more disturbed environments had lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and were more genetically differentiated from those in more natural environments. There were no consistent relationships detectable for birds. This suggests that, in general, mammal populations living near humans may have less capacity to respond adaptively to further environmental changes, and be more likely to suffer from effects of inbreeding.",10.1101/733170,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/01/16/733170.abstract,Biorxiv,5,10.1101/733170,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/01/16/733170.abstract

We used an original combination of habitat and dispersal data to revisit these predictions under various climatic scenarios. We used the future range of suitable habitat, predicted with habitat variables only, as a base layer to further predict the range or reachable habitat by accounting for both dispersal ability and landscape connectivity. Our results confirm the northward shift in range and indicate that the area of co-occurrences should also increase. However, reachable habitat should expand less than suitable habitat, especially when accounting for landscape connectivity. In addition, the potential range expansion was further limited for the red-listed D. plantarius, which is more habitat-specialist and has a lower ability to disperse.

It is also a pet with an immense ecological footprint, because even non-feral and food-subsidized cats are prolific predators. Whereas knowledge about the spatial behavior of individual domestic cats is growing, we still know little about how a local population of free-ranging pet cats occupies the landscape. Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface - the “catscape” - that potential prey have to navigate. There were almost no gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 meters to their owner’s home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats.

These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing population sizes in human transformed habitats. With time this can lead to reduced effective population size and genetic diversity which restricts the ability of wildlife to cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects are generally applicable across taxa. Here, we repurposed and synthesized raw microsatellite data from online repositories from 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density and the Human Footprint Index, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found no consistent relationships for any of our genetic metrics. While we did not detect directional effects for most species, a few generalist species responded positively to urbanization. These results contrast with consistent negative effects of urbanization in mammals and species specific positive and negative effects in birds.

Whereas taxonomic information is limited to the identity of species, functional traits determine the relationship between species identity and ecosystem functioning. Studies investigating the role of urbanization in altering these ecological parameters have mostly focused on avian communities or plant species, while arthropods such as spiders which are integral components of urban households have largely been overlooked. This study aims to understand the impact of urbanization on both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of spider assemblages across an urban–semi-urban–forest gradient in Guwahati, a rapidly growing city in northeast India. We surveyed spiders at 13 sites representing four habitat types (urban, urban parks, semi-urban, and forests) using belt transects, and also recorded functional traits relating to key life history processes. Spider species composition differed significantly between various habitats. The taxonomic diversity of spiders was highest in forests and lowest in urban parks. The turnover component was the major contributor to changing the β-diversity of spiders. Reduced diversity in urban regions was likely due to the dominance of a few synanthropic species. Generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the habitat types significantly impacted spider abundance. Functional richness was maximum in forests (Fric = 23.43) and minimum in urban habitats (Fric = 12.98), while functional divergence was maximum in urban sites (Fdiv = 0.79).

With the development of statistical tools to quantify and partially isolate the role of each of these processes, empirical metacommunity studies have multiplied worldwide. However, few works attempt a multi-taxon approach and even fewer compare two distant biogeographical regions using the same methodology. Under this framework, we tested the expectation that temperate (mediterranean-climate) pond metacommunities would be more influenced by environmental and spatial processes than tropical ones, because of stronger environmental gradients and greater isolation of waterbodies.We surveyed 30 tropical and 32 mediterranean temporary ponds from Costa Rica and Spain, respectively, and obtained data on 49 environmental variables (including limnological, hydrogeomorphological, biotic, climatic, and landscape variables). We characterized the biological communities of Bacteria and Archaea (from both the water column and the sediments), phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, amphibians and birds, and estimated the relative role of space and environment on metacommunity organization for each group and region, by means of variation partitioning using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).Environmental selection was important in both tropical and mediterranean ponds, but markedly stronger in the latter, probably due to their larger limnological heterogeneity. Spatialized environment and pure spatial effects were greater in the tropics, related to higher climatic heterogeneity and dispersal processes (e.g. restriction, surplus) acting at different scales. The variability between taxonomic groups in spatial and environmental contributions was very wide. Effects on passive and active dispersers were similar within regions but different across regions, with higher environmental effects in mediterranean active dispersers. The residual (unexplained) variation was larger in tropical pond metacommunities, suggesting a higher role for stochastic processes and/or effects of biotic interactions in the tropics.

Both processes are mediated by interactions between organismal traits and environmental constraints. Colonization probability is predicted by a species’ ability to cross the intervening matrix between a population source and the island; population persistence (or extinction) is predicted by the minimum spatial requirements to sustain an isolated population. The non-random distributions of mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf and Great Basin “sky islands” provide example study systems for evaluating the C-DIB model.Main conclusions Because different suites of traits impose constraints on the processes of colonization and extinction, similar environmental conditions can host different candidate species despite the same predicted richness.

A systematic way to assess the effect of matrix quality in fragmented landscapes could lead to a better understanding of how matrices can be used to suppress the negative effect of fragmentation. We built a computational individual-based model capable of simulating bi-dimensional landscapes with three types of land cover (habitat, suitable matrix and hostile matrix) and individuals that inhabit those landscapes. We explored in which situations changes in the proportion of the suitable matrix in the landscape and the degree of usability of this suitable matrix can mitigate the negative effect of fragmentation per se. We observed that (i) an increase in the matrix quality (increases in the suitable matrix proportion and/or usability) can suppress the fragmentation effect in 47% of the simulated scenarios; (ii) the less usable the matrix is the more of it is needed to suppress the fragmentation effect; (iii) there is a level of usability below which increasing the suitable matrix proportion does cause the fragmentation effect to cease.

This study uses LiDAR and ground-based measurements of mangroves within well quantified urban gradients in Puerto Rico to test for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed patterns of forest structure and composition. In simple regression, urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition but not structure. Results show higher tree diversity but lower mangrove diversity in the most urban forests. Structural measurements, however, were best explained by flooding, surface water chemistry, and non-urban land cover metrics. Nitrogen concentrations best explained stem density and tree size, while flooding metrics best explained stand biomass and basal area, and surrounding vegetation cover best explained canopy cover and height metrics. In multiple regression, land cover and surface water chemistry were more important than flooding, with population density again being the most important variable in explaining mangrove forest diversity. Results show that urbanization is an important influence on mangrove composition and basal area, leading to higher tree diversity and lower basal area, consistent with patterns in terrestrial forests. But urban mangrove forests are also lower in mangrove diversity and tend to have representation only by Laguncularia racemosa. Nitrogen concentrations and surrounding vegetation cover, both of which are indirectly influenced by urbanization, were positively related to tree size and canopy cover and height, respectively.

Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments.Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess.We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the world’s fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (Chelodina longicollis) that people interact with regularly or have as pets. Chelodina longicollis utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation.Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss.Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that ∼40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation.Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes.

Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have well-established mutual connections with the physiology of their hosts and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impacts of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on gut microbiota remain poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the gut microbiota in juvenile great tits (Parus major) in an urban mosaic. First, we compared the microbiota of nestlings reared in artificial nest boxes or natural cavities. Next, we analysed microbiota variations employing two distinct urbanisation frameworks, (i) the classical urban/rural dichotomy and (ii) gradual changes in the amount of impervious surface area (ISA) in the urban space and identified the environmental variables that predicted the changes in the microbial communities. Alpha diversity was influenced by cavity type and by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location. Alpha diversity was also positively correlated with the tree cover density. Beta diversity differed between urban and rural sites, and these alterations covaried with sound pollution, the distance to the city centre and the distance to the closest road. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework used to define the urban space can influence the outcomes of studies investigating animal-microbe symbiosis.

Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing much less management supported higher bird richness and density whereas city parks were the most species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the matrix and also by tree species richness within urban green spaces.

Using a large citizen-science dataset of point-counts performed throughout Iberian Peninsula (4,459 unique survey sites), we modelled the effect of road density on the occurrence of common songbirds (n=58), while accounting for potential confounding effects of environment and survey effort. We then tested if species’ occurrence patterns would be linked to specific traits related to the ability to cope with human presence. Finally, we assessed how road density affect the community compositional dissimilarity. We estimated 24 (41%) and 12 (21%) species to be negatively and positively affected by roads, respectively. Increased road encroachment was positively related with a higher prevalence of urban dwellers and negatively related with the occurrence of species nesting and foraging on the ground. Furthermore, increasing road density translated into an increasing community compositional dissimilarity, mostly due to species turnover. Our study support previous research showing that roads have different effects on the occurrence of different species, but we revealed that at least three species' traits have a clear relation with such road responses. Such trait filtering is probably causing a high species turnover between songbird communities occurring in roaded and nearby roadless areas. Overall, we found that different species-specific responses to roads translates into changes at the community level. Landscape and road-network management should be conceived acknowledging that roads are contributing to biodiversity changes. As so, building upon the concepts of Land Sharing / Land Sparing, conservation actions should be tailored according to the different species responses e.g., road verge management targeting species having a positive relation with road density; and compensation actions targeting species showing a negative response toward roads.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",10.1101/2022.01.14.476305,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/01/17/2022.01.14.476305.abstract,Biorxiv,4,10.1101/2022.01.14.476305,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/01/17/2022.01.14.476305.abstract

Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar.

We used a functional response and effect trait approach to determine how bird species’ responses to local and landscape-scale habitat of urban green spaces affects the supply of cultural and regulating ecosystem services. We sampled bird communities and habitat variables in urban green spaces that varied in local and landscape-scale habitat composition and compiled a dataset of species’ response and effect traits related to nesting, foraging, diet, and visual and acoustic aesthetic appeal. Overall, the landscape-scale context of a green space had a stronger influence on species’ abundances than local-scale habitat. Landscape-scale impervious surface surrounding our study sites interacted with response traits related to nesting in human-built structures, clutch size, and consumption of invertebrates to drive bird species’ abundances. Because correlations between response and effect traits can influence the effect traits available to provide ecosystem services at a site, we explored the correlation of these three response traits to a suite of effect traits and found the response traits were correlated with several effect traits related to diet and regulating services but correlated with few of the plumage and acoustic traits that produce cultural services. Finally, we found that effect traits associated with cultural and regulating ecosystem services varied strongly along the landscape-scale gradient of urbanization. Sites with high impervious surface cover are expected to have low levels of invertebrate pest control and visual appeal but high levels of acoustic appeal, diet evenness (generalism), and granivory.

Here we present an inference tool that uses geographically-referenced genotype data in combination with a convolutional neural network to estimate a critical population parameter: the mean per-generation dispersal distance. Using extensive simulation, we show that our deep learning approach is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly at small sample sizes (e.g., n = 10). In addition, we evaluate varying nuisance parameters during training—including population density, population size changes, habitat size, and the size of the sampling window relative to the full habitat—and show that this strategy is effective for estimating dispersal distance when other model parameters are unknown. Whereas competing methods depend on information about local population density or accurate identification of identity-by-descent tracts as input, our method uses only single-nucleotide-polymorphism data and the spatial scale of sampling as input. These features make our method, which we call disperseNN, a potentially valuable new tool for estimating dispersal distance in non-model systems with whole genome data or reduced representation data. We apply disperseNN to 12 different species with publicly available data, yielding reasonable estimates for most species. Importantly, our method estimated consistently larger dispersal distances than mark-recapture calculations in the same species, which may be due to the limited geographic sampling area covered by some mark-recapture studies.

We quantified wild hoverfly and bee abundances with trapping, standing crop of nectar with spectrophotometer, and the pollen transported by flower-visitors with DNA-metabarcoding, in 40 independent sites from seminatural to built-up areas in Northern Italy.Linear and nonlinear relationships were detected along the urbanization gradient. Pollinator abundances increased until 22% of impervious surface, dropping by 34% after that, and it also decreased with green patch distance and urban park size. Thus, suburban landscapes host more pollinators than highly cemented or seminatural areas. Moreover, pollinators diminished by up to 45% in areas with low temperature seasonality: urbanized areas likely posing thermic stress. Furthermore, the sugar mass available in nectar increased by 91% with impervious cover, indicating that city nectars were less consumed or flowers more productive. Furthermore, the species richness of pollen decreased by 32% in highly urbanized areas, and with a high incidence of exotic plants, hinting for anthropized plant communities.Synthesis and applications. Urbanization influences pollinator abundances, nectar resources and transported pollen. Pollinators are negatively affected by a thermally harsh climate in highly urbanized areas with isolated green areas and large parks. Suburban landscapes demonstrated the highest pollinator presence. In the city core, flowers contained more nectary sugar, while pollinators collected pollen from a small number of plants, mainly exotic. These findings highlight the influence of urban landscape structure and climate on pollinators and plants, showing that cities are heterogenous realities.

We selected 20 ponds differing in size and surrounding levels of urbanization as well as natural forest cover. We then used a Poisson GLM and a distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA) to relate species richness and community composition, respectively, to environmental variables. Variation in species richness was best explained by pond size (positive effect) and amount of urbanization (negative effect) in the surrounding 500 m. Community composition was mainly driven by species turnover than by nestedness, with db-RDA showing that turnover was explained primarily by urban infrastructure and forest cover.

This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 × 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = −8.4 to 0.1 °C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall – likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sørensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance - patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-decay pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.",10.1101/2020.06.04.133918,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/04/2020.06.04.133918.abstract,Biorxiv,2,10.1101/2020.06.04.133918,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/04/2020.06.04.133918.abstract

Our approach relies on (i) the use of Omniscape, an improved version of Circuitscape which allows omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of species-level dispersal simulations through a posteriori clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots, suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for the multiplicity of dispersal strategies.

We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct.

Cities often have elevated pollution levels that harm wildlife; however, the increased concentration of some pollutants can fertilize urban plants, leading to corresponding positive effects on herbivore populations. Increases in herbivory rates may lead to natural selection for greater defence phenotypes in plants. However, evidence supporting increased herbivory leading to the evolution of plant defence in urban environments is contradictory, and entirely absent from tropical regions of the world. To address these research gaps, we evaluated herbivory on Turnera subulata, a common urban wildflower, along an urbanization gradient in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We predicted that higher rates of herbivory in urban areas would lead these populations to evolve cyanogenesis, a chemical defence found in a closely related Turnera species. We assessed herbivory and screened for cyanogenesis in 32 populations along the urbanization gradient, quantified by the Human Footprint Index. Our results show that urbanization is significantly associated with increased herbivory rates in T. subulata populations. Despite elevated herbivory, we found no evidence for the evolution of cyanongenesis in any of the populations, suggesting that the fitness effects of leaf herbivory are not extreme enough to select for the evolution of plant defence in these populations.

Here we investigate the population genomics of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered lichen narrowly endemic to the southern Appalachians of eastern North America, to test the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance in shaping genetic structure, and to gain insights into the demography and reproductive biology of range restricted fungi. Analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for strong isolation by distance, but did not support isolation by environment. Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity also suggested that C. linearis had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, consistent with previous findings in other southern Appalachian taxa.

We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome.

We also explored the origin of elevational and latitudinal replacements involved in spatial changes in species assemblages in the Andes.Results We found remarkable genetic structure within the complex, which consists of numerous lineages reaching &gt;12% sequence divergence; most divergent populations occur in areas separated by topographic barriers but several of them, typically not sister to each other, co-occur with elevational segregation on mountain slopes or replace each other with latitude along the Andes. Some close relatives occur in areas separated by thousands of kilometers, with more distant relatives occupying intervening areas. The complex likely originated in the Mexican highlands and expanded extensively in South America while diverging rapidly at a constant rate into many different lineages which have persisted for millions of years. Coalescent analyses consistently revealed that the complex may comprise more than 30 species; while we do not suggest these presumptive species should be recognized by taxonomists in the absence of additional data, H. leucophrys is a distant outlier among New World birds in terms of high lineage diversity within a single recognized species.Main Conclusions Our study captured wood-wren lineages in the act of building up diversity via divergence and persistence in allopatry, achievement of secondary sympatry, and coexistence at the landscape scale mediated by ecological and evolutionary divergence. Although dispersal by wood-wrens is restricted at present and this likely accounts for strong population structure across topographic barriers, their ranges have been dynamic, managing to disperse over much of the montane Neotropics. Phases of expansion and contraction of ranges and localized extinctions of populations likely account for phylogeographic patterns which are precursors to the origin of new species and the accumulation of diversity in tropical mountains.",10.1101/376681,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/376681.1.abstract,Biorxiv,6,10.1101/376681,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/376681.1.abstract

In this context, subgenomic datasets offer novel opportunities to explore historical demography in detail, which is key to better understand the origins and maintenance of diversity in montane regions. Here we used a large ultraconserved elements dataset to get insights into the main biogeographic processes driving the evolution of the Montane Atlantic Forest biota. Specifically, we studied two species of warbling finches disjunctly distributed across a region of complex geological and environmental history. We found that a scenario of three genetically differentiated populations is best supported by genomic clustering methods. Also, demographic simulations support simultaneous isolation of these populations at ~10 kya, relatively stable population sizes over recent time, and recent gene flow. Our results suggest a dual role of climate: population divergence, mediated by isolation in mountain tops during warm periods, as well as population maintenance - allowing persistence mediated by shifts in elevation distribution during periods of climate change, with episodic bouts contact and gene flow. Additional support for the role of climate comes from evidence of their contact in a recent past. We propose that two major gaps, which we call São Paulo and Caparaó subtropical gaps, have been historically important in the divergence of cold adapted organisms in the Atlantic Forest, and could be associated to cryptic diversity. Finally, our results suggest that shallow divergence and past gene flow may be common in montane organisms, but complex demographic histories may be detectable only when using subgenomic or genomic datasets.",10.1101/439265,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/22/439265.abstract,Biorxiv,9,10.1101/439265,http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/22/439265.abstract

Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual spe- cies. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species—particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes—to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting.

We present an adjusted multidimensional spatial human footprint index (SHFI) to analyze the effects of landscape transformation on the remnant habitat connectivity for 40 terrestrial mammal species representative of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic System in Michoacan (TMVSMich), in western central Mexico. We adjusted the SHFI by adding fragmentation and habitat loss to its original three components: land use intensity, time of human landscape intervention, and biophysical vulnerability. The adjusted SHFI was applied to four scenarios: one grouping all species and three grouping several species by habitat spatial requirements. Using the SHFI as a dispersal resistance surface and applying a circuit theory based approach, we analyzed the effects of cumulative human impact on habitat connectivity in the different scenarios. For evaluating the relationship between habitat loss and connectivity, we applied graph theory-based equivalent connected area (ECA) index. Results show over 60% of the TMVSMich has high SHFI values, considerably lowering current flow for all species. Nevertheless, the effect on connectivity of human impact is higher for species with limited dispersal capacity (100–500 m). Our approach provides a new form of evaluating human impact on habitat connectivity that can be applied to different scales and landscapes. Furthermore, the approach is useful for guiding discussions and implementing future biodiversity conservation initiatives that promote landscape connectivity as an adaptive strategy for climate change.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.09.007,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X16305386,Ecological Indicators,4,10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.09.007,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X16305386

However, corridor assessments typically ignore potential conflicts between carnivores and people, which can undermine corridor effectiveness and thus conservation success. We identified safe dispersal corridors and conflict-prone movement bottlenecks for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) between protected areas in the Alborz Mountains, Iran, by mapping habitat, landscape permeability, and conflict risk. We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats. We mapped land cover using Landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 × 6 km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models. Leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially. Human-carnivore conflicts are an important constraint to connectivity and should be considered in corridor assessments.

Objectives We propose a method for identifying the best locations for wildlife crossings along linear infrastructures so as to improve the connectivity of species with varying degrees of mobility and living in different habitats. We evaluate highway impacts on mammal species. Methods The study area is the Gresivaudan Valley, France. We used allometric relationships to create eight virtual species and model their connectivity networks, developing a nested method defining populations by daily travel distances and connecting them by dispersal. We tested the gain in connectivity for each species produced by 100 and 600 crossing locations respectively in crossable, i.e. with crossing infrastructures, and uncrossable highway scenarios. We identified the crossings that optimize the connectivity of the maximum number of species combining the results in multivariate analyses. Results Highly mobile species needing a large habitat area were the most sensitive to highways. The importance of locomotive performance in structuring the graphs decreased with highway impermeability. Depending on the species, the best locations improved connectivity by 0–10 and 2–75 % respectively in the crossable and uncrossable scenarios.

One common approach for determining corridor locations is least-cost corridor (LCC) modeling, which uses algorithms within a geographic information system to search for routes with the lowest cumulative resistance between target locations on a landscape. However, the presentation of multiple LCCs that connect multiple locations generally assumes all corridors contribute equally to connectivity, regardless of the likelihood that animals will use them. Thus, LCCs may overemphasize seldom-used longer routes and underemphasize more frequently used shorter routes. We hypothesize that, depending on conservation objectives and available biological information, weighting individual corridors on the basis of species-specific movement, dispersal, or gene flow data may better identify effective corridors. We tested whether locations of key connectivity areas, defined as the highest 75th and 90th percentile cumulative weighted value of approximately 155,000 corridors, shift under different weighting scenarios. In addition, we quantified the amount and location of private land that intersect key connectivity areas under each weighting scheme. Some areas that appeared well connected when analyzed with unweighted corridors exhibited much less connectivity compared with weighting schemes that discount corridors with large effective distances. Furthermore, the amount and location of key connectivity areas that intersected private land varied among weighting schemes. We believe biological assumptions and conservation objectives should be explicitly incorporated to weight corridors when assessing landscape connectivity. These results are highly relevant to conservation planning because on the basis of recent interest by government agencies and nongovernmental organizations in maintaining and enhancing wildlife corridors, connectivity will likely be an important criterion for prioritization of land purchases and swaps.",10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01929.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01929.x,Conservation Biology,3,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01929.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01929.x

There is a drive to develop quantitative, comparable metrics of success to improve conservation interventions. Yet the qualitative, normative choices inherent in decisions about what to measure — emerging from fundamental philosophical commitments about what conservation is and should be — have received scant attention. We address this gap by exploring perceptions of what constitutes a successful biodiversity corridor in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, an area of global biodiversity significance. Biodiversity corridors are particularly illustrative because, as interventions intended to extend conservation practices from protected areas across broader landscapes, they represent prisms in which ideas of conservation success are contested and transformed. We use Q method to elicit framings of success among 20 conservation scientists, practitioners and community representatives, and find three statistically significant framings of successful corridors: ‘a last line of defence for biodiversity under threat,’ ‘a creative process to develop integrative, inclusive visions of biodiversity and human wellbeing,’ and ‘a stimulus for place-based cultural identity and economic development.’ Our results demonstrate that distinct understandings of what a corridor is — a planning tool, a process of governing, a territorialized place — produce divergent framings of ‘successful’ corridors that embody diverse, inherently contestable visions of conservation. These framings emerge from global conservation discourses and distinctly local ecologies, politics, cultures and histories. We conclude that visions of conservation success will be inherently plural, and that in inevitably contested and diverse social contexts success on any terms rests upon recognition of and negotiation with alternative visions.",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.04.019,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320716301562,Biological Conservation,3,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.04.019,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320716301562

By applying each of the eight metrics for the study network, nodes were ranked according to their contribution to the overall network connectivity.

We surveyed nine populations throughout the taxon’s range using five polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity of N. m. francisci was relatively high despite its restricted distribution, and that there is little evidence of population bottlenecks or extensive inbreeding within populations. We found substantial gene flow and detectable first generation migration, suggesting that N. m. francisci is unlikely to be currently endangered by genetic factors. Pairwise population differentiation and clustering indicate some structuring between populations on different drainages and suggest that dispersal probably occurs mainly via a stepping stone from the closest riparian corridors.

Many species are found today in the form of fragmented populations occupying patches of remnant habitat in human-altered landscapes. The persistence of these population networks requires a balance between extinction and colonization events assumed to be primarily related to patch area and isolation, but the contribution of factors such as the characteristics of patch and matrix habitats, the species’ traits (habitat specialization and dispersal capabilities) and variation in climatic conditions have seldom been evaluated simultaneously. 2. The identification of environmental variables associated with patch occupancy and turnover may be especially useful to enhance the persistence of multiple species under current global change. However, for robust inference on occupancy and related parameters, we must account for detection errors, a commonly overlooked problem that leads to biased estimates and misleading conclusions about population dynamics. 3. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence of the effects of different environmental variables on the extinction and colonization rates of a rich butterfly community in the western Mediterranean. The analysis was based on a 17-year data set containing detection/nondetection data on 73 butterfly species for 26 sites in north-eastern Spain. Using multiseason occupancy models, which take into account species’ detectability, we were able to obtain robust estimates of local extinction and colonization probabilities for each species and test the potential effects of site covariates such as the area of suitable habitat, topographic variability, landscape permeability around the site and climatic variability in aridity conditions. 4. Results revealed a general pattern across species with local habitat composition and landscape features as stronger predictors of occupancy dynamics compared with topography and local aridity. Increasing area of suitable habitat in a site strongly decreased local extinction risks and, for a number of species, both higher amounts of suitable habitat and more permeable landscapes increased colonization rates. Nevertheless, increased topographic variability decreased the extinction risk of bad dispersers, a group of species with significantly lower colonization rates. 5. Our models predicted higher sensitivity of the butterfly assemblages to deterministic changes in habitat features rather than to stochastic weather patterns, with some relationships being clearly dependent on the species’ traits.",10.1111/1365-2656.12118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12118,Journal of Animal Ecology,8,10.1111/1365-2656.12118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12118

This study aimed to assess whether it is more effective to focus restoration actions on existing corridors or to establish habitats in other strategic areas that can create new dispersal pathways to enhance connectivity. We considered a real agroecosystem in northern Italy, based our analyses on graph-theory and habitat availability metrics, and focused on the Hazel Dormouse as the target species. We compared the connectivity increase resulting from (i) the simulated restoration of existing priority corridors, i.e., those with significant presence of forest but in which restoration actions would still result in considerable connectivity gains, or (ii) the simulated plantation of 30 hedgerows along new priority pathways, i.e., those areas with no current forest cover in which habitat creation would be more beneficial for connectivity. Implementing new priority pathways resulted in substantially larger connectivity gains (+ 38%) than when restoration efforts were concentrated in improving already existing corridors (+ 11%). Establishing hedgerows along new pathways allowed enhancing the complementary and functionality of the full set of landscape corridors and proved more efficient than just strengthening the areas where dispersal flows were already concentrated.

In this manuscript, we present an approach to prioritize areas for preserving landscape connectivity by using the landscape matrix in central-western Mexico and the connectivity for habitat patches considering ensembles of different terrestrial organisms. We aggregated three multispecies connectivity scenarios into a composite corridor scenario. To evaluate which corridors were more important to multispecies connectivity, we used the composite corridor model based on two ways: (1) the contribution of habitat patches that the corridor connects to overall connectivity and (2) the corridor’s capability for facilitating movement across the network of patches. Habitat patches were classified according to their value for the conservation of multispecies connectivity by hybridizing circuit-based and spatial prioritization models for connectivity conservation. We developed current flow models for each species (n = 40) and combined them in four prioritization models corresponding to the three multispecies groups and an all-species group. We found that the corridors having the highest accumulated importance (CI ≥ 58) are located along the protected areas of Pico de Tancitaro and the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera de la Mariposa Monarca–RBMM, Spanish acronym), which have relatively similar spatial distributions corridors compared to areas with priority for conservation (relative rank test = 0.6). Within those areas, there are permeable sectors with high connectivity retention values that could optimize their ecological function as multispecies corridors. Our approach is applicable to different landscapes, and it allows for identifying priorities for connectivity conservation by integrating landscape elements outside habitat patches.",10.1007/s10113-018-1393-8,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10113-018-1393-8,Regional Environmental Change,4,10.1007/s10113-018-1393-8,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10113-018-1393-8

A critical step in the process is identifying resistance values for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of such information, expert-opinion is often used. However, the use of expert-opinion is seen as subjective, human-centric and unreliable. This study derived resistance values from grey squirrel habitat suitability models (HSM) in order to compare the utility and validity of this approach with more traditional, expert-led methods. Models were built and tested with MaxEnt, using squirrel presence records and a categorical land cover map for Cumbria, UK. Predictions on the likelihood of squirrel occurrence within each land cover type were inverted, providing resistance values which were used to parameterise a least-cost model. The resulting habitat networks were measured and compared to those derived from a least-cost model built with previously collated information from experts. The expert-derived and HSM-inferred least-cost networks differ in precision. The HSM-informed networks were smaller and more fragmented because of the higher resistance values attributed to most habitats.

To maintain or increase connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches, conservation actions may focus on creating and maintaining reserves and/or influencing management on non-reserves. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, an intensively cultivated agricultural matrix, at four assumed, but ecologically realistic, anuran dispersal distances. We compared connectivity in the current landscape to the historical landscape and putative future landscapes, and evaluated the importance of individual and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape, where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has maintained connectivity in the current landscape by replacing destroyed wetlands, but these pits likely provide suboptimal habitat. Also, because there are fewer total wetlands (i.e., wetlands and irrigation reuse pits) in the current landscape than the historical landscape, and because the distribution of current wetlands is less clustered than that of historical wetlands, larger and longer dispersing, sometimes nonnative species may be favored over smaller, shorter dispersing species of conservation concern. Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves do not affect connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse pits; however, they likely provide the highest quality anuran habitat. To improve future levels of resilience in this wetland habitat network, management could focus on continuing to improve the conservation status of non-reserve wetlands, restoring wetlands at spatial scales that promote movements of shorter dispersing species, and further scrutinizing irrigation reuse pit removal by considering effects on functional connectivity for anurans, an emblematic and threatened group of organisms. However, broader conservation plans will need to give consideration to other wetland-dependent species, incorporate invasive species management, and address additional challenges arising from global change in social-ecological systems like the Rainwater Basin.",10.1890/13-1755.1,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-1755.1,Ecological Applications,4,10.1890/13-1755.1,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-1755.1

In most studies, the effects of fragmentation on such species are analyzed based on Euclidean inter-patch distances. This approach, however, ignores the role of the landscape matrix. Recently, therefore, functional distances that account for the composition of the landscape surrounding the habitat patches have been used more frequently as indicators for patch occupancy. However, the performance of functional and non-functional connectivity measures in predicting patch occupancy of such species has never been compared in a multi-species approach. Here we evaluate the effect of habitat connectivity on the patch occupancy of 13 habitat specialists from three different insect orders (Auchenorrhyncha, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera) in fragmented calcareous grasslands. In order to calculate functional distances we used four different sets of resistance values and rankings. We then modelled species’ occurrence using both Euclidean and functional (based on least-cost modelling) inter-patch distances as predictors. We found that functional connectivity measures provided better results than the non-functional approach. However, a functional connectivity measure that was based on very coarse land-cover data performed even better than connectivity measures that were based on much more detailed land-use data. In order to take into account possible effects of the landscape matrix on patch occupancy by habitat specialists, future metapopulation studies should use functional rather than Euclidean distances whenever possible.

Such rapid forest loss and associated fragmentation reduces the availability of suitable habitat for wildlife and creates dispersion barriers. Understanding the prevalence and impacts of this anthropogenic disturbance, and developing ways in which to mitigate such changes, is thus critical to the conservation of Borneo's wildlife. Here, we applied a path selection function with conditional logistic regression and used it to develop a resistance surface for a population of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) residing within a fragmented and human dominated landscape in Malaysian Borneo. We used cumulative resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analysis to predict how connectivity may change in response to four future scenarios involving conversion of remaining unproductive forest to palm oil plantations, conversion of unproductive palm oil back to forest, and restoration of a riparian buffer zone along the river, and combination of the two forest restoration scenarios. We showed that Sunda clouded leopard movement is facilitated by forest canopy cover and resisted by non-forest vegetation, particularly recently cleared/planted and underproductive (flooded) plantation areas with low canopy closure. By combining resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path modelling we mapped core areas and the main linkages among them, and identified several key pinch points that may limit regional connectivity of the population. We predict that Sunda clouded leopard connectivity in the region can be greatly enhanced through the protection of privately owned forest patches and the reforestation of underproductive oil palm plantation areas, and creation of a forested buffer zone along the river. Conversely, we show that if the region's unprotected forests were to be converted to plantations then connectivity across the Kinabatangan floodplain would be significantly reduced.",10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.016,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717317652,Biological Conservation,8,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.016,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717317652

Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.",10.1038/ncomms3572,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3572,Nature Communications,6,10.1038/ncomms3572,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3572

While road verges can be habitat for a large number of species, and have been proposed to act as dispersal corridors, roads can act as barriers to movement. This duality of roads and road verges has however rarely been assessed simultaneously, and it is unknown to what degree it depends on the amount of traffic on the road and on the habitat quality of the road verge. We used fluorescent powdered dye to track movements of flower-visiting insects along roads with varying traffic intensity, and in verges with contrasting habitat quality (flowering plant species richness and flower density). Insect movements along road verges were more frequent than movements into the adjacent habitats, indicating that verges act as corridors. The frequency of movements that required crossing the road was lower compared to the frequency of movements that did not, suggesting that roads are barriers. The movement patterns were independent of traffic intensity, but the barrier effect was stronger when the road verge had a higher density of flower resources. The effect of roads as a barrier and of the road verges as corridors were independent of each other. Our results suggest that flower-visiting insects tend to remain longer in road verges with high density of flowers and we therefore suggest that managing road verge habitats for an increased plant diversity will mitigate the known negative impacts of roads on insect populations.",10.1111/ecog.05847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05847,Ecography,4,10.1111/ecog.05847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05847

The brown bear, Ursus arctos, needs connectivity to supply the primary habitat requirements including food, water, shelter and space and to provide gene flow among all populations in the Iranian Caucasus. Aims In the present study, we investigated the status and habitat requirements of an endangered brown bear population within the Iranian Caucasus. Methods We applied an approach of consensus species distribution modelling to estimate the distribution of suitable habitats for brown bears using uncorrelated environmental variables. We then used the concept of circuit theory on resultant breeding patches to evaluate regional patterns of connectivity among these patches. Key results We predicted that ~9.10% of the study area is suitable for the brown bear at present. Ten patches (7.95% of the study area) were detected as suitable for breeding populations, where some populations are not able to survive without connectivity. The results indicated that habitat connectivity is sometimes widely affected by a high concentration of human activities such as roads, settlements and mining activities. Our findings showed that existing conservation areas could not safeguard the connectivity of brown bear habitats across the Iranian Caucasus. Conclusions Our results can help target fine-scaled planning approaches for the maintenance of bear meta-population structure, as well as facilitate the movement of individuals by protecting different landscape features. Implications The populations of brown bear are among the first to be harmed by the loss of habitat and connectivity, and, thus, this species is an appropriate focal species for linkage design that is beneficial for threatened populations of other co-existing species such as Persian leopard, grey wolf and Eurasian lynx. Moreover, the brown bear is among the most popular flagship species for conservation planning, which might increase public support for the restoration of habitat and linkages.",10.1071/WR17175,http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WR17175,Wildlife Research,2,10.1071/WR17175,http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WR17175

A technique to increase dispersal between otherwise isolated fragments is the use of corridors. Although previous studies have compared dispersal between connected fragments to dispersal between unconnected fragments, it remains unknown how dispersal between fragments connected by a corridor compares to dispersal in unfragmented landscapes. To assess the extent to which corridors can restore dispersal in fragmented landscapes to levels observed in unfragmented landscapes, we employed a stable-isotope marking technique to track seeds within four unfragmented landscapes and eight experimental landscapes with fragments connected by corridors. We studied two wind- and two bird-dispersed plant species, because previous community-based research showed that dispersal mode explains how connectivity effects vary among species. We constructed dispersal kernels for these species in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments by marking seeds in the center of each landscape with 'IN and then recovering marked seeds in seed traps at distances up to 200 m. For the two wind-dispersed plants, seed dispersal kernels were similar in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments. In contrast, dispersal kernels of bird-dispersed seeds were both affected by fragmentation and differed in the direction of the impact: Morella cerifera experienced more and Rhus copallina experienced less long-distance dispersal in unfragmented than in connected landscapes. These results show that corridors can facilitate dispersal probabilities comparable to those observed in unfragmented landscapes. Although dispersal mode may provide useful broad predictions, we acknowledge that similar species may respond uniquely due to factors such as seasonality and disperser behavior. Our results further indicate that prior work has likely underestimated dispersal distances of wind-dispersed plants and that factors altering long-distance dispersal may have a greater impact on the spread of species than previously thought.",10.1890/15-0734.1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0734.1,Ecology,8,10.1890/15-0734.1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0734.1

However, little attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators. Location Krakow area, Poland. Methods We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region of Krakow, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19 patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled. We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands using Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Results The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones. Dissimilarity was also spatially aligned for large-bodied butterflies and hoverflies on embankments. The species dissimilarity of pollinators divided into trait-based groups was not spatially structured on grasslands. Main conclusion Our study highlights the potential function of railway embankments as corridors for at least some pollinator populations. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve spatial processes linked with the distribution and turnover of pollinator species in agricultural landscapes.

We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC > 0.8).

Eastern grey kangaroos ( Macropus giganteus ) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (H E: 0.224–0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region ( N e = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane ( N e = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity ( H E : 0.188 – 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo populations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity.

In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments. Our results show that urban woodlands primarily form invasive-native associations, and that major invasive species, such as <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> and <i>Lantana camara</i> exclude each other while forming cliques.

As a National Central City, Zhengzhou has a large population and is undergoing rapid economic development, resulting in an urgent demand for green space within the city in recent years. We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective. A GI network—consisting of an open space with vegetation as the main body—was designed for the main urban area of Zhengzhou using the traditional landscape ecological pattern theory, integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, circuit theory, and other methods. Evidently, the area of green space in Zhengzhou City in 2021 was 36 231.6 hm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. GI prediction results indicate that continuous expansion of the main urban area did not result in significant changes in the size of GI in the city. The GI within the urban area was relatively fragmented, forming 15 GI hubs, most of which were densely distributed along the edges of the main urban area. This study proposed the construction of a GI network with a target corridor and target points based on the existing corridor. This included the identification of seven target corridors and 15 target hubs; the total length of the corridor was 77.032 km, with a total of 31 target points. In summary, the GI network pattern of “one protection barrier, two lines, three loops and more points” was proposed. With new urban problems constantly emerging, this research could provide a theoretical reference basis for the planning of GI in the main urban area of the National Central City. The study provides concrete evidence on the optimum pattern for the construction of GI networks in cities with large populations.</jats:p>",10.3389/fenvs.2022.878656,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129046305&doi=10.3389%2ffenvs.2022.878656&partnerID=40&md5=101a7f80604463fba573dddbcdd4c7c0,Frontiers in Environmental Science,10,10.3389/fenvs.2022.878656,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129046305&doi=10.3389%2ffenvs.2022.878656&partnerID=40&md5=101a7f80604463fba573dddbcdd4c7c0

A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index <i>PC</i> gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined.

For conservation actions to be effective there must be an understanding of how landscape structure and biological traits shape dispersal. We assessed the effects of landscape, sex and population management (reintroductions and translocations) on gene flow of Leontopithecus rosalia, an endangered arboreal primate living in highly fragmented forests of Brazil. We genotyped 201 individuals using 14 microsatellite loci to answer three questions: (1) How far does L. rosalia disperse? (2) Is dispersal sex-biased? (3) What are the relative contributions of population management, distance, roads and landscape resistance to genetic kinship? We hypothesized that (1) gene flow decrease between more distant sites; (2) males disperse more than females; and (3) management and land-cover resistance (i.e. landscape resistance) are the variables that most influence genetic kinship. We found positive spatial population-structure up to 8 km. The spatial structure was similar between females and males suggesting that they equally contribute to gene flow. Management and landscape resistance best explained genetic kinship, showing that different land-cover types affect the dispersal at different degrees of landscape permeability. We advocate that maintaining more permeable landscapes is essential to ensure dispersal and gene flow of arboreal mammals.

It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human-altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human-mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat. X. virginica is a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human-associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human-altered areas as compared to semi-natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional-scale population structure across the study system (GʹST = 0.146) and substantial co-ancestry between the sampling regions, where co-ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human-mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site-level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (&lt;1 km), surprising given X. virginica's large body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity. © 2020 The Authors.

Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating conclusions on network structure.

Yet, studies on non-volant city mammals are limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. Here, I evaluated the density and adaptability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species with a series of advantageous pre-adaptations that could facilitate city life, in highly built up urban environments of a tropical city Joao Pessoa (&gt;800,000 people), in NE Brazil. I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km2) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas. Marmosets are common in Brazilian cities and could provide opportunities for contact with nature and increased well-being of human urban dwellers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11252-021-01131-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107437369&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-021-01131-5&partnerID=40&md5=fe83c74bafca134bc53f198fd50845a0,Urban Ecosystems,1,10.1007/s11252-021-01131-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107437369&doi=10.1007%2fs11252-021-01131-5&partnerID=40&md5=fe83c74bafca134bc53f198fd50845a0

This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

Connectivity of eco-estates in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",Ecological Indicators,Ecological Indicators,103,425,"Abstract Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species’ colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.04.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064317616&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2019.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=e9ad6c2c09775cbfe214a7c918f4ed96,Ecological Indicators,4,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.04.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064317616&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2019.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=e9ad6c2c09775cbfe214a7c918f4ed96

In view of this, this paper referred to the principle and basis of land sample selection, laid out the typical sample belt of Hebei Province, and used the minimum cumulative resistance model, with the forest land, grassland and wetland of the sample belt as the ecological source land, and the artificial surface as the source of urban expansion. In terms of attributes and external attributes, five indicators - elevation, land landscape type, soil type, ecological sensitivity, and ecosystem service value - have been selected to investigate the ecological security pattern of land use. The findings were as follows: five ecological safety areas were designated for the typical sample area in Hebei Province; these were ecological core area, ecological buffer area, ecological transition area, ecological occupation area, and ecological management area. The spatial pattern distribution of ecological source areas and urban expansion sources showed clear boundaries, all of which were concentrated and contiguous, though the ecological connectivity was weak. The ecological core area, which was the core area of the nature reserve, was at least 1 082.42 km2. The buffer area, which was the medium connecting the upper, middle and lower reaches, was as much as 6 943.63 km2. This area should be used rationally for protection. The ecological transition area, which was the key area for the development and construction of the reserve following the urban and rural construction, was 3 189.25 km2. The ecological occupation area, with an area of 5 835.34 km2, was distributed in the ecological transition area and the ecological governance zone. It was the main area of urban construction and economic development. The ecological management area was 1 710.70 km2; it was primarily an ecologically fragile area and was a key region for ecological restoration and future ecological industry development. In summary, There should be a large-scale planting of the ecological core area and the ecological buffer zone. The ecological transition area should be controlled strictly to expand to the ecological land, and the ecological occupation area should be developed according to the needs of the urban population and the economy. It is necessary to return farmland to the lake to restore the water surface, strictly to the soil environmental safety bottom line, and optimize the ecological safety barrier system. © 2019, Science Press.

As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems. LOCATION: England, UK. TIME PERIOD: 1990–2018. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: One hundred and twenty‐six non‐native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants. METHODS: Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along‐channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers. RESULTS: Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non‐native species.",10.1111/geb.13051,https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/30606; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13051; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13051; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20210133623?q=(similar%3a20103162818); https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6854349; https://storre.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/30606; https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/30606/1/geb.13051.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/download/286353997.pdf,Global Ecology and Biogeography,8,10.1111/geb.13051,https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/30606; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13051; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13051; https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20210133623?q=(similar%3a20103162818); https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6854349; https://storre.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/30606; https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/30606/1/geb.13051.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/download/286353997.pdf

Known populations of the critically endangered western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) are largely restricted to bushland remnants in rapidly urbanising areas of south-Western Australia. Habitat use is thought to be driven by nutritional content, structure and connectivity of canopy vegetation. At the southernmost extent of the species' range, habitat use is largely unknown, although it is expected to be different from previous descriptions due to differences in vegetation characteristics. We used VHF and global positioning system tracking collars to determine short-term home-range size, diurnal refuge use and night-time tree use of western ringtail possums in bushland remnants within Albany City. Possums had small home ranges (0.88 ha) that were negatively correlated with percentage canopy cover used a variety of daytime refuges (predominantly dreys) and preferentially utilised marri (Corymbia calophylla) and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) at night. These results confirm that differences in habitat use among populations exist and suggests that the species is reasonably flexible in its use of habitat. Management of western ringtail possums needs to be population specific and will benefit from further examination of habitat use in the variety of occupied habitats. © Australian Mammal Society.",10.1071/AM17026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049249124&doi=10.1071%2fAM17026&partnerID=40&md5=265eafc587095f9b3731a21f0a8261c0,Australian Mammalogy,4,10.1071/AM17026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049249124&doi=10.1071%2fAM17026&partnerID=40&md5=265eafc587095f9b3731a21f0a8261c0

In this sense, the present study promoted an analysis of the environmental quality of vegetation fragments in the sub-basins of Ribeiraõ Anhumas, Campinas, Saõ Paulo, Brazil by calculating and interpreting the circularity index (CI), in order to define the format of the fragments, connectivity/isolation and the use and occupation of the environment as well as area and location, in order to promote the diagnosis and identification of priority areas for the implementation of restoration and environmental management actions. It was identified, therefore, that the remaining vegetation of the upper, middle and lower sub-basins is divided between small and medium unconnected fragments of which 56.2% and 24.2% presented an elongated and moderately elongated shape, respectively, and, therefore, high susceptibility to external interference and edge effects.
